QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000336	I think the Vubbes of the Miner's Village have made their way into the woods. {nl} Maybe that's the reason behind the sudden increase in monsters too. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000337	I better ask Sir Aras to search for Vubbes in other areas too. {nl} In the meantime, please take a look at the upper side.
