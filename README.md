# Tree of Savior Open Text Client (OTC)   
Welcome to the Tree of Savior OTC Github Repository.

This repository is dedicated to translating Tree of Savior game texts from **Korean to English**. Our goal is to complete the English translations first so that it can be used to translate the game to other non-English languages. 

We hope our disclosing of game texts and opening this repository will pave a quicker way for our non-English speaking fans to enjoy the game in their native languages in the future. 

You can read about our plans for the international version of Tree of Savior in our [Dev Blog](http://http://blog.treeofsavior.com/en/)


## Contributions

We welcome your contributions in form of issues or pull requests. 

To prevent the situation where many people would translate the same lines, please comment and indicate which lines you'd be contributing to in the "Lines for Translation" issue found in the 'Issues' menu so that others would skip those lines.
