QUEST_20150317_000015	Much time will have drifted between us when you see this message. {nl}I am the Goddess of Fate and Wisdom - Laima.
QUEST_20150317_000016	600 years ago - at the time I am sending this revelation - I saw a great deal of death and grief. {nl}Your seeing of this message likely means that all that I foresaw has come to pass.
QUEST_20150317_000017	The Demons have started the first cataclysms, and the goddesses have vanished. {nl}I knew all of this in advance and spent great effort to interfere with fate, but my power alone was not enough.
QUEST_20150317_000018	I have wandered through many far-seeing dreams to find an answer. {nl}You were at the end of them…a Savior.
QUEST_20150317_000019	However, I knew the Demons would never rest while I kept my power. {nl}I was forced to hide away, until the time of your appearance.
QUEST_20150317_000020	I resolved to divide my being and subsist inside many of these messages. {nl}I continued to secretly create them, even as the kingdoms flew by over the millennia. 
QUEST_20150317_000021	Savior. These messages are hidden across axes of time. {nl}Once they are brought together, I will regain my complete form and help against the Demons.
QUEST_20150317_000022	There may be a weight on your shoulders for this divine task, but it will pass. {nl}Perhaps, in the muddy midst of your trials and tribulations, something will turn around.
QUEST_20150317_000023	Nevertheless, only you and I can save this world.
QUEST_20150317_000024	The first Paladin will hold the next one. {nl}I expect you at the highest flower garden.
QUEST_20150317_000025	The dark aura is indeed unpleasant… {nl}Yet, if this message is truly from the Goddess Laima, then I am simply amazed.

QUEST_20150317_000057	In the past, pilgrims would go their way through this forest. {nl}But now the number of soldiers has influenced the monsters' presence.

QUEST_20150317_000065	The Pokubu have always been here, but there's also been the occasional monster.
QUEST_20150317_000066	I've thought about it. It's no mistake that the goddesses have left us all. {nl}If that weren't so, then there wouldn't be so many monsters.
QUEST_20150317_000067	They say there's someone living around the forest who receives the Goddess' strength.

QUEST_20150317_000084	I'm not sure I understand it all…but basically, the goddesses didn't disappear all at once.

QUEST_20150317_000086	The Goddess Vakarine left us shortly before Medis Diena. {nl}Both Zemyna and Ausrine completely disappeared soon after that. {nl}It's already been four years.
QUEST_20150317_000087	That's right. The strangest one of all was the Goddess Laima. {nl}No one's really sure when she disappeared.
QUEST_20150317_000088	Besides, isn't Laima the Goddess of Fate and Wisdom? {nl}She probably knew all about it.

QUEST_20150317_000181	A long, long time ago, it's said that some wandering nomads were suffering from a cursed plague. {nl}The honorable first Paladin removed the curse with a healing relic.

QUEST_20150317_000678	It is like a net which is connected tightly, {nl}so one with a normal level of divine power can not escape from it.
QUEST_20150317_000679	For what reason was this barrier created? {nl}Is it related to the fact the goddess who controls the flames of this world is staying here?
QUEST_20150317_000680	Agailla Flurry called Gabija to the tower, so this barrier is not meant to lock Gabija in. {nl}To find out the reason for this, we first have to understand the composition of the barrier.

QUEST_20150317_000687	Unlike priests who control the blessing of the goddess directly, {nl}the wizard is defined as a person who releases various magic information or the blessing of the goddess.
QUEST_20150317_000688	Okay then, What is mana anyway? {nl}We can say the true quality of mana is the life force on this land. {nl}The life force of nature. That doesn't just imply the length of lives.
QUEST_20150317_000689	The life force is a form of energy that composes this world and it spreads like branches to various places in the world. {nl}If you could find the source of that energy, you may obtain astonishing power.
QUEST_20150317_000690	The Diary of Antares' Investigation
QUEST_20150317_000691	As I was investigating about mana, I discovered one important fact: {nl}The mana which flows steadily in the Magicians' Tower behaves strangely on the top of the tower.
QUEST_20150317_000692	After lengthy research, I found out that there is a third type of energy which is {nl}different from the types mana we recognize, and it has a shape of a specific object.
QUEST_20150317_000693	I can tell this object is from the era of Agailla Flurry since no one knows the existence of this object.
QUEST_20150317_000694	I am sure that this object will bring a new beginning of magic, {nl}but since it is separated at the deepest place in the top of the tower, we have no way of reaching it.
QUEST_20150317_000695	We can't blow up the tower or destroy part of it for the sake of getting it.

QUEST_20150317_001079	Revelation of Mage Tower
QUEST_20150317_001080	It is an old story of Fedimian before the Goddess Statue. 
QUEST_20150317_001081	A long time ago, the people of Fedimian were ordinary - not much different from the ordinary people of the rest of the world. However, the people of Fedimian did differ from their worldly peers in one aspect.
QUEST_20150317_001082	The people of Fedimian were a very cautious people. In the sense that they take the word "cautious" much more seriously. These people are as cautious around fire as they are without.
QUEST_20150317_001083	The Fedimians have been modest about this one difference they have with others. {Nl}Even those who stayed at Fedimian for a while could not pick up the trait. {Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001084	Thanks to this cautiousness, the people of Fedimian fared better during tough times, as they were able to sense danger coming. 
QUEST_20150317_001085	Because of this, no few words are said about the cautiousness of the Fedimian people. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001086	At Fedimian, if someone dropped money on the ground, it will be gone forever. In a world where money is mostly silver coin, only the creditors would know exactly how much money has been lost in this manner. {Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001087	Why money disappears into the ground at Fedimian remains unknown. {Nl} Some people believe the Goddess Zemynas absorbs money that makes contact with her area. But most commoners believe this was done to reduce the demand of silver coins from creditors. {Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001088	By believing that the Goddess herself wants the silver that falls on her lands, it would make sense to say that people find it fruitless trying to dig up silver on her grounds. The fact you can offer silver coin at Fedimian as tribute to her reinforces this idea.{Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001089	In any case, the fact that one could lose money by dropping it on Fedimian soil has made Fedimians very careful in handling their money. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001090	However, as much as one tries to be careful, mistakes still happen. {Nl} This is more so the case with young girls. {Nl} One day, it happened to a girl named Aiste. {Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001091	Normally, when one drops silver coins on the ground, it would scatter about on the road, and then disappear without a trace.{Nl} Fedimians usually curse their own carelessness and move on, but Aiste was different: she wondered why and how it happens.  {Nl} {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001092	To find out what happened, Aiste began inspecting the area she lost her coins at. In her search she came across a beggar beside the deep end of the canal. {Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001093	Aiste asked the elderly beggar, {nl}"If you ever come across the silver coins I dropped on the ground, would you return them to me? I worked very hard everyday for those coins and really need them."{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001094	To the beggar, Aiste was asking for the unthinkable. After all, to look for dropped coins at Fedimian was practically impossible. {Nl} The old beggar tried to explain to Aiste, and remarked, {Nl} "Look, I also lose coins in the area. If I could have you find them, that would be great." {Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001095	Almost immediately, the beggar felt guilty of the mocking words he blurted out. He apologized to Aiste, {Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001096	"Why don't you go to where you work and explain what happened to them?" "And make sure you look lost."{nl} {Nl} "I'll be right here, always looking for your coins." {Nl} {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001097	Upon hearing the beggar's words, Aiste thanked the beggar, and went on to follow his advice. {Nl} Through his selfless act, the beggar suddenly felt a revived sense of responsibility. He looked toward the silhouette of the leaving Aiste, his heart heavy and warm from this experience. {Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001098	Aiste went to the orchards at the outskirts of Fedimian. {Nl} That was where she worked - the orchards.{nl} At the orchards, while one could just pick fruit from the trees, it was also important to take the fruit that fell on the ground. {Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001099	Smaller hands worked better for picking fruits, so young children were often hired at the orchards. {Nl} Some orchards took it a step further: hiring monkeys, whose hands are smaller than that of children, to pick fruit. Monkeys did work more effectively than children, but often ate the fruit they picked. Thus, most owners relied on hiring children. {Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001100	Anyways, Aiste visited the orchard she worked at and explained her situation to the orchard owner. {Nl}Unfortunately, the owner was not in a good mood, having just had a quarrel with his wife, since there is Fedimian knew what happens silver fell to the ground, I spent the money that children throw away the other Te, we think that it is put a deterrent to yourself. {Nl} {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001101	And so he said, {Nl}"Just as you've been able to pick up all my fruit, you should be able to find your lost money at Fedimian, so do not tell me to give you double your pay." {Nl } The orchard owner's unfeeling words drove Aiste to tears. {Nl} The orchard owner felt bad seeing her, but did not want to give her any more money. {Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001102	He was soon overtaken by guilt and said, {Nl} "If you really need that money, you should go to Unjan'i" {Nl} {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001103	Aistė set foot for Unjan'i's place as soon as she heard those words. {Nl}Fortunately, Unjan'i's house was located outside Fedimian walls. {Nl} Had it been inside the walls, he risked losing his money and silverware to the soil.
QUEST_20150317_001104	It is for the reason of preventing this problem that Unjan'i lived on the outskirts of Fedimian. {Nl} Aistė knocked on Unjan'i front door, and explained her situation to Unjan'i once he appeared.{Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001105	Unjan'i, after hearing Aistė's story, stated, {Nl} "Even for kids, it's stupid. To lose money to Fedimian soil and still not know why it is so." {Nl} {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001106	Aistė was surprised by what Unjan'i had to say, and grew sad hearing it. {Nl} She finally asked, {Nl} "Then why is it that this happens?" {Nl} {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001107	Even Unjan'i did not know the true answer, so he improvised, {Nl} "The Goddess Zemynas might be taking everything." {Nl} {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001108	Hearing those words, Aistė replied, {Nl} "Then I will just have to go ask the Goddess Zemynas." {Nl} Unjan'i was not shaken by those words, he said, {nl} "While you're at it, would you be able to ask the Goddess for my silverware back as well?"{nl} {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001109	Unjan'i did not take to heart what he said, but Aistė did. She immediately set out to do what was said. Unjan'i felt sorry for Aistė, but did not have the courage to call her back as she faded into the distance.{Nl} {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001110	A tired Aistė arrived at Zemynas's statue. {Nl} She prayed to the goddess the statue represented, her head completely down. {Nl} "Goddess, please. Please return my lost silver coins." {Nl} Aistė began to shed the tears she had been holding up thus far.{Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001111	How long did she pray crying? {Nl} Suddenly, Aistė heard a voice that responded to her. {Nl} "My child, you have come to take back what you have lost?" {Nl} {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001112	Aistė knew for a fact that it was really the Goddess Zemynas that was addressing her. She stopped crying, cleared her voice and replied so. {Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001113	She could again hear the Goddess's voice. {Nl} "Aistė, what you want from me now, I've no favorite way to accomplishing. All I can do is give grain and fruit to hard-working farmers."{nl} {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001114	"But, today, I worked really hard!" {Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001115	"I know. So I will give you and your neighbors an opportunity. Look under your feet." {Nl} {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001116	The Goddess's voice faded with those words, and Aistė found silver coins under her feet. {Nl} She looked to where she had left her coins, and found that the tears she shed had transformed into coins. {Nl} Aistė was very happy, and made sure to pick up all the silver before leaving {Nl} {Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001117	After a number of steps, Aistė thought about Mr. Unjan'i, {nl}And, again, went to his house and knocked his door. {Nl} Mr. Unjan'i told Aistė he waited for her. {Nl} "I'm sorry. I regretted sending you off like that. I'll give you some silver. This time, be careful not to drop any as you go home." {Nl} {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001118	As Mr. Unjan'i held out his silver coins, Aistė shook her head and said, {nl} "No thank you, the Goddess returned all the coins. I remembered you saying you had also lost silver, so I wanted to give you what remains after getting back what I lost. I don't need these extra coins."{nl} {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001119	At first, Unjan'i was skeptical about the coins being returned, so he was surprised when Aistė showed him genuine coins. After thinking for a while, Unjan'i said,{Nl} "Now, I think it's only fair that I give you some, since I had you do me a favor." { nl}
QUEST_20150317_001120	Aistė obliged and equally split her coins with Unjan'i.{Nl} After this Unjan'i uncle gave Aistė an additional bag of coins.{Nl} {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001121	After leaving Unjan'i's house, Aistė suddenly remembered the Old Beggar was also looking for lost coins and worried for him. {Nl} On her way there she met the orchard owner. {Nl}Upon seeing Aistė, the orchard owner was overjoyed.{Nl} "I was looking for you. I'm sorry for sending you off earlier. As an apology, I'll give you your salary again. Please be careful not to lose it this time."{Nl} {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001122	The orchard owner took out a large amount of coins to repay Aistė. {Nl}However, Aistė shook her head and said,{Nl} "The Goddess Zemynas returned my money to me. Mr. Unjan'i also helped me, so I have plenty now. So, no thank you. See? Look." {Nl} {nl }
QUEST_20150317_001123	Saying that, Aistė opened the bag of coins she got from Mr. Unjan'i and showed the orchard owner. The orchard owner was extremely surprised, as the amount money she got from the Goddess and Mr. Unjan'i surpassed the amount he had.{nl} {Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001124	Disregarding the amount Aistė had shown him, the orchard owner said,{Nl} "Well, even so, I would be ashamed for not giving you my due, so please just take it." {Nl} {nl} After saying this, the orchard owner stuffed more coins in Aistė's bag, and left.{Nl} By the time Aistė could muster up the energy to call the orchard owner, he was too far away. {Nl}
QUEST_20150317_001125	After a bit of walking, Aistė arrived at where she met the beggar. As she approached the Old Beggar, he saw Aistė and hurried over to her. {nl}Aistė showed the beggar the bag and said, {Nl}"Look, I found your silver coins." {Nl} {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001126	Even though the beggar was worn out, he cupped his hands to get his coins back. Seeing this, Aistė was brought to the brink of tears.{Nl} {nl}She wondered, how much begging the beggar had to do to attain so many coins. {nl}With a heavy heart, Aistė gave the Old Beggar his hard earned coins.{Nl} {nl}

That is my offer." {nl}"You think I'll switch between winning and losing, huh?
QUEST_20150317_001154	With her hand to her chin, the old woman gave a puzzling response. {nl}"Three times each, should be enough. Return to me after you make six gambles. {nl}    Naturally, if you don't earn more after your sixth bet, I will win."

QUEST_20150729_002310	Aiste asked the Old Beggar.{nl}[Did you by any chance pick up the silver coins I dropped? If you did, could you please return them to me? I worked all day long to earn that money. I really need it.]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002311	The Old Beggar was taken aback. {nl}Searching for lost silver coins in Fedimian was, in every way possible, absurd. {nl}The Old Beggar was about to explain to Aiste but instead, changed his mind and lazily told her.{nl}[I also lost my silver coins around here. It would be nice if you looked for mine as you search for yours.]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002312	What if you went back to your work and explained your situation?]{nl} And hesitantly added. {nl}[In the meantime, I will look for your silver coins here.]{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002313	And so he said. {nl}[Just like all the fruits getting picked up at an orchard, any money that falls on the streets of Fedimian can be picked up as well. So don't ask me to pay you twice.]{nl}Hearing the Orchard owner's regretful words, Aiste's eyes became tearful.{nl}The Orchard Owner's heart slightly swayed, but even so, he did not want to give her any money. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002314	And so he closed his heart and harshly said.{nl}[If you really need silver then go get some scraps from the Silversmith.]{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002315	After listening to Aiste's story, the Silversmith said.{nl}[Even if you are young, you are so foolish. How could you not know that any money that falls on the streets of Femidian disappears never to be foudn again.]{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002316	Aiste, shocked by the Silversmith's words, became even more depressed.{nl}After a while Aiste asked.{nl}[Why do these bad things happen?]{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002317	Clearly the Silversmith did not know the reason so he just said whatever came to his mind.{nl}[The Goddess Zemyna must have taken it or something.]{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002318	After hearing that Aiste said.{nl}[Then I will have to go and ask the Goddess Zemyna.]{nl}The Silversmith was astounded and only replied.{nl}[If you are thinking of doing that then you should ask her to return my lost silverwares too.]{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002319	Although Aiste was exhausted, she seeked the Goddess Zemyna.{nl}Prostrating in front of the statue of Goddess Zemyna, she desperately prayed.{nl}[Please, return to me the silver coins I lost.] {nl}While offering his prayers, Aiste could no longer hold in her sadness and finally burst into tears{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002320	For how long did she cry and pray?{nl}Suddenly, Aiste heard a voice replying to her. {nl}[My child. You wish to find what is yours?]{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002321	The Goddess' voice was heard again.{nl}[Aiste, what you want from me right now is not the method I approve of. Where I reign there is no harvest nor fruits to those who do not work.]{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002322	[But I worked very hard today.]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002323	[I know. Therefore I will give you and others a chance. Look beneath your feet.]{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002324	After taking a few steps Aiste thought of the Silversmith. {nl}So Aiste returned to his home and knocked. {nl}As if the Silversmith was expecting Aiste, he came out and said.{nl}[I am sorry. I regretted sending you away like that. I will give you a few silver coins. Don't lose them this time and get home safely.]{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002325	When the Silversmith offered his silver coins, Aiste shook her head and replied.{nl}[It's alright. The Goddess gave me back a silver coin. On top of that she gave me even more. So I remembered how you have lost your silverware so I came to give you my extra silver. You don't need to give me silver coins anymore.]{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002326	The Silversmith could not believe the Goddess returning the lost silver coins, but he was shocked to find Aiste's silver coins legitimate. After thinking a while, the Silversmith replied.{nl}[Then how about this. You give me what you want while you accept what I was about to give you. Isn't that fair? On top of that I will give you a pouch to carry your extra silver.]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002327	After leaving the Silversmith's Aiste was on her way back home. Suddenly, she remembered the Old Beggar and worried if he was still looking for her lost coins.{nl}While on her way, she met the Orchard Owner.{nl} The Orchard Owner was very glad to find Aiste and exclaimed. {nl}[I was looking for you. In truth, I was really sorry to send you away like that… As an apology let me pay your wage again. Becareful not to lose it again.]{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002328	Then he tried to pay even more silver than Aiste's wage. {nl}But Aiste shook her head and said.{nl}[The Goddess Zemyna returned me the money I lost. Not only that but the Silversmith also helped me so now I have too much. I am grateful but I don't need silver anymore. Here, take a look.]{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002329	While Aiste couldn't reply properly because of the extra silver, the Orchard Owner told him.{nl}[Anyway, I feel embarrassed if I don't give it to you. Please accept it.] {nl}{nl}Even before Aiste could reply, the Orchard Owner forced his money into the pouch and left.{nl}When Aiste regained her composure, the Orchard Owner was already too far away to be called.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002330	Aiste hesitated for a moment, then made her mind to visit the Old Beggar.{nl}When Aiste was close to where she first met the Old Beggar, he spotted her first and hurriedly dashed to her. He showed her the silver coins he was clenching onto and said.{nl}[Look. I found your lost silver.]{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002331	Aiste received the Old Beggar's silver and then gave him her pouch containing the silver coins.{nl}[This is a gift from me for finding my lost silver. It's also the grace I received from the Goddess Zemyna.]{nl}{nl} The Old Beggar was so amazed he disappeared before he could say anything.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002332	And asked what she was doing with the gold bars.{nl}Then the old lady replied.{nl}[If I get two gold bars married, they will give birth to baby bars and make me richer. But maybe these bars don't like each other they are not making babies so I'm worried.]{nl} Baffled by her answer, Modestas replied.{nl}[No, if you want to become rich with gold bars, you should use them to open a business or smartly invest them. To have the bars marry to make children, does that make any sense?]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002333	Then the old lady answered bluntly. {nl}[Why not? If only the sacrament is successful this is the best way. Safe and methodically sound.]{nl}[Instead of spouting nonsense you should rather gamble like me. That sounds like a better investment.]{nl}When Modestas spoke thusly, the elderly lady was upset.
QUEST_20150729_002334	And she rebuked.{nl}[Are you telling me my method is worse than your gambling?]{nl}[Isn't that obvious? By gambling, you can sometimes win or lose, but it's impossible to make more gold bars using your approach.]{nl}After Modestas spoke, the old lady took a moment to ponder and responded.{nl}[Do you want to bet on that?]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002335	Modestas was instantly alarmed by the old lady's attitude. Although he was a little bit afraid, he could not resist the lure and excitement of gambling and finally asked.{nl}[What bet?]{nl}[Your gambling or my method. Let's see who can make more gold bars.]{nl}[But aren't there times you can lose your bet?]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002336	[You don't have to worry about that. Gambling just means you win some and you lose some. I can't change that. But I can fixate the pattern of winning and losing.]{nl}[Huh? What do you mean?]{nl}[If you take on my bet, from now on against whomever you bet you will always win once and then lose the next one.]{nl}[To win once and then lose once, that happens frequently in gambling.]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002337 	When Modestas spoke, the old lady shook her head and further elaborated.{nl}[I am saying from the moment you leave here, you will win your first bet, no matter the impossible odds. Your next and second bet, you will definitely lose even if the odds are stacked in your favor]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002338 	Modestas was confused so he asked again.{nl}[Are you saying I will alternate winning and then losing every bet I make no matter the odds?]{nl}[That's right. That will happen. You should alternate betting a lot of money on your first bet and then bet as little as possible on your every other bet. That way, shouldn't you earn enough money to buy a gold bar? How about it? Will you take on my bet with these conditions?]{nl}[For how long will I have the power to alternate winning and losing?]{nl} 
QUEST_20150729_002339	The old lady, stroking her chin with her fingers, contemplated for a while and answered.{nl}[Three of each should suffice. That is, you must gamble six times and return to me. Of course, you must remember you will lose your sixth bet. Otherwise I will win the bet no matter what.]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002340 	Modestas voice shook slightly as he asked.{nl}[How much do I have to earn?]{nl}The old lady answered.{nl}[For now, I will give you a gold bar. When you return to me, you must bring back another gold bar. If you can do that then, whether my gold bars have given birth or not, I will consider it your win. Time limit will be. Hm. Let's see... One week should be enough.]{nl}Modestas questioned for the last time. {nl}[If I lose, what will I have to pay?]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002341	The old lady answered.{nl}[About that...]{nl}{nl}After a pause the old lady continued.{nl}[For now, if you win I will give you all my gold bars. Further, I will let you keep your ability to alternate winning and losing forever. But if you lose...]{nl}[What if I lose?]{nl}Modestas nervously asked.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002342 	[If I win, from then on one of your friends will disappear for every bet you lose.]{nl}When he heard the condition for losing, he became afraid. 그러나 곧 앞으로 내기를 안 하면 그만이지 라는 생각이 들었고, 곧이어 해도 이기면 그만이지 라는 생각이 들자 저도 모르게 고개를 끄덕여 승낙하고 말았습니다. Above all, Modestas was the kind of person who would never shy away from a bet.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002343 	[Hey, Aren't you in a hurry? Since you are riding a horse you must be in a hurry so don't mind me and go on ahead.]{nl}Upon hearing Modestas, Zigfried answered.{nl}[I am indeed in a rush, but I can walk some more before I have to ride the horse again. This horse isn't like other horses and is faster than he seems.]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002344 	Since Zigfried didn't move like Modestas expected, he spoke again and urged him.{nl}[Even so you will be late. Wouldn't it be better to hurry up?]{nl}{nl}Slightly annoyed, Zigfried disagreed.{nl}[Don't you believe my word? Or are you ignoring what I said?]{nl}Modestas frantically responded{nl}[No, I did not mean it like that...]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002345 	Before Modestas could explain further, Zigfried interrupted.{nl}[Since you can't believe my claim, let us bet on it.]{nl}Modestas could barely hold himself from bursting aloud "You are on. What do you want to bet?"{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002346 	If you think about Modestas' typical behavior, him not taking on the bet right away could be considered a miraculous show of inhuman willpower.{nl}[What... What kind of bet?]{nl}[I am saying let us bet whether my horse is fast or slow. If I lose I will give you my horse.]{nl}Modestas really desperately fought his inner urges to take on the bet.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002347 	As soon as the bet started, Zigfried tried every method possible to command the horse to move. Despite his efforts it didn't move a single hoof at all.{nl}At the end, Zigfried repeatedly cursed its strange behavior. Realizing he will be late to his appointment without a horse, he threw the reins to Modestas and sprinted away.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002348 	When Zigfried was gone, Modestas felt uncomfortable.
QUEST_20150729_002349 	[Hey mister over there with the horse. Will you come help us?]{nl}Modestas did not know what the handful of soldiers needed help with, but he couldn't ignore being asked to help. He pulled the horse and approached them.{nl}As Modestas came close, one of the soldiers greeted him.{nl}[It is good that you are here. We have a wager here and we hope you will be the judge.]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002350 	A small banter turned into a big argument which finally grew up to become a big money bet. The soldiers had already gathered  the money and only had to decide the winner. Unfortunately everybody had picked a different Goddess and could not decide on the winner.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002351	So after a discussion, they decided to ask the first passerby to choose a Goddess. The soldier who had picked that Goddess would win the wager. They had considered choosing the first person to passby was the will of the Goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002352 	Since a big jackpot was on the line the soldiers waited with bated breath on Modestas' answer. {nl}Because this type of question has no right answer, Modestas said aloud the name of his favorite Goddess. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002353 	But the soldiers reacted strangely.{nl}Depending on Modestas' choice of Goddess, a certain soldier should have rejoiced while the others mopped. Yet, noone was delighted nor dismayed, only perplexed aspect could be seen.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002354 	Modestas, curious at their reaction, asked for an explanation to which one of the soldiers answered.{nl}[Our opinions were quartered but your choice of Goddess doesn't belong to any of them. Now our opinions are evenly divided in five.]{nl}Then the soldiers resumed their squabble about how to decide the winner. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002355 	The mood began to deteriorate so Modestas wanted to leave them. {nl}When he was about to take off the soldiers blocked his path and accused him.{nl}[It's your fault the argument heated up even more, you are not thinking of just leaving now are you?]{nl}Intimidated by the irritated soldiers, Modestas dared not to escape. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002356 	As can be seen, Modestas could not just stand to watch a bet in front of him so he with a little pursuation, he fell into gambling again. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002357 	Modestas who got trapped in the heat of the moment and ended up participating in the soldier's bet, finally remembered it was his turn to lose.{nl}But it was too late.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002358 	If you think about it, even if it wasn't his turn to lose, all it took for him to lose was one more vote for any other Goddess than Modestas'. Clearly, with the odds against him, the probability of winning was low to begin with.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002359 	But the victor was chosen unexpectedly. An officer found the soldiers slacking, disciplined them and was about to lead them away. {nl}The soldiers, obeying the superior's command, were about to march off when they shrewdly asked him which Goddess he favored. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002360 	Someone approached Modestas, who had been lying down hurt, and helped him get back on his feet. He turned out to be one of the people standing on the side, the Wagon Owner. {nl}The Wagon Owner who helped Modestas uttered with relief.{nl}[I am glad you are not too hurt. And your horse also didn't hurt himself tripping over that pit.]{nl}Modestas noticed a well hidden pit where the Wagon Owner pointed.{nl}The Wagon Owner continued.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002361	[My horse became injured here and can no longer pull my wagon. It's just an empty wagon, but at any rate, it won't be going anywhere for a while. That's why I have a proposition. Won't you sell me your horse? I believe with a healthy horse pulling the wagon, even my injured horse can help pull it in some way.]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002362 	It was an unexpected suggestion, but Modestas had to ride the horse to quickly find and catch up to the soldiers. He immediately refused the offer.{nl}The Wagon Owner tried to explain there was no way his injured horse can pull the wagon alone but Modestas was not persuaded. After his repeated refusal, the Wagon Owner offered a new suggestion.{nl}[Then let's do this. What if you buy my wagon? I will sell it for cheap. Since my injured horse can't pull the wagon, it will be better off in hands.]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002363 	Modestas admitted his defeat and promised to repay later. When he was about to leave pulling the horse and the wagon, the Old Alchemist smiled dubiously so Modestas took another look at his surroundings.
QUEST_20150729_002364 	Suddenly a suspicious light radiated in front of Modestas and in a flash his lead had transformed into gold. To the dumbfounded Modestas the Alchemist shamelessly mentioned.{nl}[Now what you owe me is one gold bar, so be sure to repay it.]{nl}The mad Modestas protested, but the Alchemist had never specified the item in his hand was a lump of lead.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002365 	[This time, no matter what, I have to wage a bet against the world's richest, well maybe not the richest, but a nearby wealthy man.]{nl}As soon as he uttered these words, his surroundings shook like an earthquake and a heavy, deep voice declared.{nl}[The richest in this region is I.]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002366 	Modestas scanned his surroundings but failed to find anyone. So he asked.{nl}[Who are you?]{nl}The heavy deep voice answered his question.{nl}[I am where you stand. In your tongue, I am called the Mountain.]{nl}Modestas in disbelief, couldn't help but talk back.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002367 	[You are the Mountain.]{nl}[That's right. I am the Mountain and just like what you are looking for, the richest around here.]{nl}[You are the Mountain. Well no, even if you are the Mountain, how can you claim to be the richest?]{nl}[I own much land for my sierra stretches far. Further in me I contain large valuable lodes.]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002368 	Even if the veins the Moutain contained was nothing but rocks, he thought he could end up owning a large quarry to dig out valuable stones. Instead, the Mountain had paid an inadequate reward.{nl}When Modestas pointed it out, the Mountain disagreed.{nl}[All you own are two horses and one wagon.
QUEST_20150729_002369 	Surely one must wage things of equal value. This boulder is worth as much as you own.]{nl}With that said, the Mountain returned to his former self never to deal with Modestas nor anyone else ever again. {nl}Modestas, in his desperate situation, had wasted his crucial chance to just win one big boulder.{nl}Despite his bad luck, he consoled himself knowing at least he had horses and a wagon to transport the boulder.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002370 	In front of Modestas, who had been worrying, appeared a familiar figure. It was none other than the one who had started the bet, the suspicious old lady.{nl}The old lady asked Modestas.{nl}[How is it? Is it going well?]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002371	Modestas confessed he was far from making profits, instead being in debt, and he had wasted all his chances to win and only had his last, losing bet remaining.{nl}After listening to his story the old lady flatly added.{nl}[Since you only have one bet left, go ahead and make your last losing bet. Then all that's left for you to do is pay up your end of the bargain for losing the bet against me.]{nl}Modestas was a man who loved to gamble but he was not the type to throw a tantrum nor was he a sore loser.
QUEST_20150729_002372 	[Since you are unsure how to transport this boulder you won unexpectedly, how about this? Normally, I wouldn't change preset conditions, but as an amusement I will give you a suggestion. Why don't you use your last bet to see whether or not I can lift this boulder up into your wagon? Even if you lose, at least you can have this heavy boulder loaded on your wagon.]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002373 	Modestas who had nothing to lose, nodded his head to accept her proposal. But before he could consent to the bet, the old lady continued. {nl}[But I can't just give you such a favorable idea for free. Therefore I will add one more condition.]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002374 	When Modestas asked about the condition, the old lady answered.{nl}[You are to take the boulder, which I will load onto the wagon, to Klaipeda. Then, turn it into an object of value which everyone will recognize and esteem. If you are successful then the punishment for losing the bet against me will become void. Your friends will not disappear. Since you already lost the bet against me, although this is difficult, I will still give you one more chance. How about it?]{nl}Like always Modestas had no choice.
QUEST_20150729_002375 	When the boulder was set in its proper place with the help of the soldiers, the Alchemist who had left returned with another person. The Alchemist had brought with him a famous Dievdirbys sculptor.{nl}To the famous Dievdirbys the Alchemist suggested.{nl}[Won't you sculpt a statue of a Goddess using this boulder, on this central site of Klaipeda? If this boulder is changed into a statue of a Goddess, then nobody in Klaipeda will be able to deny its significance. I think that will fulfill your promise to the old lady.]{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002376 	The one who appeared disguised as a senior and waged a bet, moved the mountains to give a boulder, he comprehended it a divine providence and explained and convinced others.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002377 	Therefore everyone believed Modestas and agreed to have the Dievdirbys sculpt a statue in honour of the Goddess.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002378 	When the statue was finally finished, the citizens of Klaipeda gathered, curious to know the identity of the Goddess who had been raised in the center of their beloved city.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002379 	The Dievdirbys who had sculpted the statue had already vanished deep into the forest so the citizens of Klaipeda repeatedly questioned Modestas for her name. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002380 	Despite the inumerous questions nobody received an answer from Modestas. {nl}At any rate, this is the story of how the Goddess statue of Klaipeda came to be. Even now that statue stands in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002381	Thenceforth when Modestas took on a wager, he always betted the same thing. Her identity.{nl}To uncover the name of the Goddess, numerous people challenged Modestas to a bet.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002382 	But no matter the impossible odds, Modestas never lost a bet. Therefore nobody was able to win the answer from Modestas for years and time flew by.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002383 	Thus the secret of Modestas was only revealed after his death in his will. {nl} The identity of the Goddess who had orchestrated everything was the Supreme Goddess, the deity of all Goddesses, Ausrine. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002384 	In the end, Goddess Ausrine, in exchange for winning a bet against a certain Gambler from Klaipeda, gifted him an interesting life full of mystery, to the city of Klaipeda a stunning statue and to the world a tale to last for the long times to come.
