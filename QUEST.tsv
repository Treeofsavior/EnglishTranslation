xQUEST_20150317_000013	So, you want to learn more about this stone slate. {nl}If you wish, I will show you the will of its creator.
xQUEST_20150317_000014	Goddess Laima
xQUEST_20150317_000015	By the time you receive this, a great deal of time will have passed. {nl}I am the Goddess of Fate and Wisdom - Laima.
xQUEST_20150317_000016	When I first made this revelation, 600 years ago, I had witnessed much death and grief. {nl}Your seeing of this message likely means that all that was forseen has come to pass.
xQUEST_20150317_000017	The Demons have started the first of these calamities, and the goddesses have all but vanished. {nl}I knew all of this in advance and spent great effort to interfere with fate, but my power alone was not enough.
xQUEST_20150317_000018	I have wandered through many far-seeing dreams to find an answer… {nl}And you were at the end of those dreams… a Savior.
xQUEST_20150317_000019	That being said, I expected the Demons would never rest while I held the power of foresight. {nl}I chose to hide my form, until the time of your appearance.
xQUEST_20150317_000020	I resolved to split myself, and live inside several of these messages. {nl}I continued to secretly create them, even as the kingdoms flew by over millenia. 
xQUEST_20150317_000021	Savior. These messages are hidden across the axis of time. {nl}Once they are brought together, I will regain my complete form and help bring an end to the Demons.
xQUEST_20150317_000022	There may be a weight on your shoulders for this divine task, but it will pass. {nl}Perhaps, in the muddy midst of your trials and tribulations, something will turn around.
xQUEST_20150317_000023	Nevertheless, only you and I can save this world.
xQUEST_20150317_000024	The first Paladin will hold the next one. {nl}I will look for you at the highest flower garden.
xQUEST_20150317_000025	The evil energy and volition is indeed unpleasant. {nl}Yet, if this message is truly from the Goddess Laima… it simply leaves me full of amazement.
xQUEST_20150317_000026	Well, you should hurry and go find Sir Uska. {nl}I'm sure he can tell you where to go next.{nl}May the Goddess bless your fate…

xQUEST_20150317_000055	I don't know where to start. {nl}Have you heard anything?
xQUEST_20150317_000056	By royal command, we've come to this forest to investigate some strange events. {nl}Witnesses reported something about a "large face" and "withery fingers". {nl}What in the world could that be?
xQUEST_20150317_000057	In the past, pilgrims would go their way through this forest. {nl}But now, the number of soldiers have influenced the monsters' presence.
xQUEST_20150317_000058	Four years ago, the goddesses often blessed us with signs of their presence. {nl}As it is now, our combined prayers don't even bring a tremor. {nl}Have they truly abandoned us?
xQUEST_20150317_000059	Vacenin personally goes to each region to deal with things. {nl}He gets uncomfortable when he stays in the city.
xQUEST_20150317_000060	Do you plan on staying or enlisting? {nl}If you're thinking about it, I can see about moving you up.
xQUEST_20150317_000061	Monsters might appear anytime, anywhere, so be prepared.
xQUEST_20150317_000062	Where in the world could the Goddess Zemyna have gone…
xQUEST_20150317_000063	What on earth do you call this?
xQUEST_20150317_000064	I think the Goddess of Earth - Zemyna would mourn more than anyone else.
xQUEST_20150317_000065	The Pokubu have always been here, but aside from them, there's been the occasional monster.
xQUEST_20150317_000066	I've thought about it. It's no mistake that the goddesses have left us all. {nl}If that weren't so, then there wouldn't be so many monsters.
xQUEST_20150317_000067	They say there's a place in the forest where someone earned a favor from the goddesses…
xQUEST_20150317_000068	I want to go home.
xQUEST_20150317_000069	It seems like the number of monsters here never decreases.

xQUEST_20150317_000079	We must focus on the land, too. {nl}The world still isn't ruined… right?
xQUEST_20150317_000080	If we maintained our respect, then we would still have that favor and knowledge. {nl}One would think, that perhaps we brought these troubles upon ourselves by relying solely on the Goddess.

xQUEST_20150317_000083	Indifferent Widow
xQUEST_20150317_000084	I still don't quite understand it all. {nl}But basically, the goddesses didn't disappear all at once.
xQUEST_20150317_000085	The first to disappear was the Goddess Gabija. {nl}I heard it was a very long time ago. {nl}One by one, starting with Gabija, they stopped replying.
xQUEST_20150317_000086	The Goddess Vakarine left us shortly before the 'Day of the Divine Tree'. {nl}Both Zemyna and Ausrine completely disappeared soon after that. {nl}It's already been four years.
xQUEST_20150317_000087	That's right. The strangest one of all was the Goddess Laima. {nl}No one's really sure when she disappeared.
xQUEST_20150317_000088	Besides, isn't Laima the Goddess of Fate and Wisdom? {nl}She must have known this day would come.
xQUEST_20150317_000089	Resting Guard
xQUEST_20150317_000090	I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow in the knee…
xQUEST_20150317_000091	And yet, it doesn't matter. Come out and face me, you monsters!
xQUEST_20150317_000092	Just now, I saw a goddess appear in my dream… {nl}How surreal…
xQUEST_20150317_000093	Still. I have a duty to defend the kingdom. It's why I'm here now.
xQUEST_20150317_000094	Uska was an old friend of mine.
xQUEST_20150317_000095	We received our tests together, and Uska got to where he is now with my support. {nl}Oh, those were some crazy days… It'd be nice to get together again!
xQUEST_20150317_000096	Just don't believe everything he says. {nl}He's known in his hometown for being quite the show-off.
xQUEST_20150317_000097	Me? I find it funny, so I just leave him alone. 
xQUEST_20150317_000098	Uh, wait. I'll take back what I said about not believing a few things.

xQUEST_20150317_000103	I look for people like you - ones who saw the Goddess appear in their dreams.
xQUEST_20150317_000104	In the beginning, I thought the Revelators' visions were a mistake. {nl}The goddesses have been gone for a long time.
xQUEST_20150317_000105	Didn't you hear it? Silent to all our prayers, on the Day of the Divine Tree, four years ago?
xQUEST_20150317_000106	You can find each and every Class Master across the kingdom. {nl}Why don't you visit them and learn what you can?
xQUEST_20150317_000107	You don't know? You must have come from really far away. {nl}Four years ago, things went out of control in the capital's center.

xQUEST_20150317_000129	I think it would be nice if all these Revelators were a sign that the goddesses are back.

xQUEST_20150317_000210	There's a rumor that General Ruklys is negotiating with King Kadumel on behalf of the citizens.
xQUEST_20150317_000211	A Record of an Officer
xQUEST_20150317_000212	I heard that Premier Eminent is in negotiation with General Ruklys. We may have to move to the Fortress of Great Land, and the city might be taken by kingdom soldiers. It might be a good idea if we consider our citizens. The Fortress of Great Land will not easily be occupied by enemies. 
xQUEST_20150317_000213	King Kadumel wants to persecute the citizens. However, Premier Eminent is trying his best to avoid that and secure the city's safety. The kingdom's military has yet to display any threatening movements.
xQUEST_20150317_000214	We have to wait until Costas arrives.{nl}There's lots to be done, so I hope he arives soon.
xQUEST_20150317_000215	Cryomancer Costas

xQUEST_20150317_000219	A Record of Kingdom Officer
xQUEST_20150317_000220	There has been no progress since Ruklys and his people moved to the Fortress of Great Land. The clerics who are infleunced by Maven are pessimistic about aiding the effort. The King is recruiting Magicians and paying them a handsome salary, but we expect little to no progress, even with their participation.
xQUEST_20150317_000221	A Record of a Citizen
xQUEST_20150317_000222	How could this happen!? Lydia Schaffen is going to the aid of Kadumel soldiers.
xQUEST_20150317_000223	A Record of an Executive at the Kingdom Military
xQUEST_20150317_000224	Lydia Schaffen, someone I've only heard about through rumors, came to the city with her followers. The officers and soldiers expect that she will change the circumstances of battle. His Majesty ordered us to support her at all costs.
xQUEST_20150317_000225	A Record of a Citizen
xQUEST_20150317_000226	The Fortress of Great Land has fallen! It's all over...
xQUEST_20150317_000227	General Ruklys is dead, and the Fortress of Great Land has been destroyed. Some people say he died to Lydia Schaffen's arrow, while others say that he died to the royal magicians. It is indeed a sad news.
xQUEST_20150317_000228	To support Kalis Knitage, I moved here from headquarters.{nl}If you have any questions, please direct them to headquarters, located in the Square of Lamentation.
xQUEST_20150317_000229	It doesn't feel good to be posted here, due to Kalis Knitage.{nl}Furthermore, thieves are also running around, so we are waiting for support from headquarters. 
xQUEST_20150317_000230	I have seen the silhouettes of those who have fallen to the curse up to now, but things will be different now that I'm here.
xQUEST_20150317_000231	Once the city's curse is lifted, will it bring back the fallen?{nl}No, but our lords have tried for generations to keep this place going.{nl}And they've done everything they could think of. 
xQUEST_20150317_000232	Graverobber Stephonas

xQUEST_20150317_000250	At times like this, it's better to make things yourself than to buy it from the shops. {Nl} I might be a supply soldier by heart, but my work is no different than that of a blacksmith.

xQUEST_20150317_000253	Gesti's demons are relentlessly attacking.{nl}It seems they also can extend their evil influence to the Pantos living here. 
xQUEST_20150317_000254	Pantos used to be kind, but now they try to kill us when they spot us.
xQUEST_20150317_000255	There is a tree here that Pantos all worship.{nl}Perhaps that tree has been contaminated by evil forces...yeah, that's probably the case.
xQUEST_20150317_000256	Please protect the Romuva Barrier which is located at the top of this valley.{nl}We will take care of the rest when our brothers arrive.

QUEST_20150317_000260	Antares
QUEST_20150317_000261	What. Are you trying to disturb my experiment again?{nl}I can't let that happen.
QUEST_20150317_000262	Be careful! I'm sure Antares is behind all this. {nl}It will explode when you go near it. {nl}You'd better lure the monsters and remove them one at a time.

QUEST_20150317_000264	Please protect me while I am calming the Jewel of Prominence.

QUEST_20150317_000274	The catastrophe will not end there.{nl}You must have seen the crystal that is on the end of the root.
xQUEST_20150317_000275	The demons changed it to swallow even the spirits easily to help the growth of Austras Koks.{nl}Because of this, many monsters will be born and they will be more violent.{nl}
xQUEST_20150317_000276	When I found out everything, I didn't have any power to prevent this catastrophe.{nl}The numbers and the forecasts that I sent to Zachariel were all forgotten due to the demons' plot.{nl}
xQUEST_20150317_000277	Austras Koks will keep growing.{nl}When that will end.. That is beyond my power to measure.{nl}

xQUEST_20150317_001141	In the town of Klaipeda, there once lived a man by the name of Modestas. {nl}He was a good, honest man - but had one major flaw that his friends and family all worried about.  {nl}His wife was especially so. Mister Modestas was not lazy, nor very clever, but not too foolish.  {nl}He did not drink, or repeatedly get into fights. {nl}The man had one flaw, and it was that he was a man who loved to gamble.
xQUEST_20150317_001142	During the day, Modestas would work hard and would never let himself go hungry - but whenever {nl}he earned more than he really needed, he would always spend it all on his gambling habits. {nl}The wife would always try to save this money, but not one extra coin would ever go toward their home.
xQUEST_20150317_001143	When there was time, Modestas' wife would often go to the shrine, and pray to the Goddess' likeness. {nl}But Modestas continued his odd habits, and the people around him grew increasingly concerned. {nl}After all, the mind of a gambler would think, 'Today may be small, but tomorrow it could be big!' {nl}And so the days rolled by, same as they ever were, until he reached a peculiar day.
xQUEST_20150317_001144	Like most of his days, Mister Modestas was heading home after gambling away his excess coin. {nl}He walked though the Siauliai Woods on the path to Klaipeda, when there was a peculiar old woman on the road.
xQUEST_20150317_001145	This old woman seemed not only old or frail, but had an unnerving aura around her. {nl}She was acting strangely, as if distracted with thought or obsessed with whatever she was doing, and {nl}Modestas thought about simply ignoring the woman and walking past. Nothing would have happened if he did that, {nl}but curiosity got the better of him.
xQUEST_20150317_001146	To be precise, what really turned his head toward the old woman, was what was being held in her hands. {n]}Gold. The woman seemed to be obsessing over two gold pieces, doing something with them. {nl}Unable to hear, Modestas drew closer to the strange woman.

xQUEST_20150317_001148	The old woman spoke plainly.  {nl}"Why not? If that way bears fruit, it'll be good. It's safe and secure." {nl}"That's ridiculous. You should do what I do, and take a gamble." {nl}The woman was incensed.
xQUEST_20150317_001149	"So, you think your betting ways are better?" {nl}"Why wouldn't I? There are moments where I could win or lose, but your way won't make any gold at all." {nl}With Modestas' words, the old woman seemed to think. {nl}"Let's make a bet, then."

xQUEST_20150317_001151	"Don't worry about that. You will lose, or you will win - That won't change.

xQUEST_20150317_001153	Modestas was still confused by these strange words. {nl}"So, you're saying I'll win on every odd bet, and lose on every even one?" {nl}"Yes. It will be so. You will win coin, and then you won't. Is that not fair? {nl}    One coin will be enough to succeed, no matter how many bets you make. That is my offer." {nl}"You think I'll switch between winning and losing, huh?
xQUEST_20150317_001154	With her hand to her chin, the old woman gave a puzzling response. {nl}"Three times each, should be enough. Return to me after you make six gambles. {nl}    Naturally, if you don't earn more after your sixth bet, I will win."
xQUEST_20150317_001155	Modestas seemed to tremble. "How much should I earn, then?" {nl}"You start with one gold piece," she replied, "and when I come, bring everything but that one. {nl}    If you stretch that single piece to anything more, then you win. As for the time… I give you one week." {nl}"So, what will you have when I lose?" Modestas reminded her.

xQUEST_20150317_001157	"When I win, then after this, the friends you know will disappear every time you lose a bet." {nl}Modestas was unnerved by the conditions set.
