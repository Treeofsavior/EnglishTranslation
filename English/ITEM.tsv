ITEM_20151116_007255	Sepanjang umurnya, dari mulai paladin pertama, telah banyak orang yang menjaga Tenet Church. Pada masanya itu telah mengalami peningkatan hingga membuat suatu kombinasi kekuatan dan kenyamanan.
ITEM_20151116_007256	Setelah hari Medzio Diena, sebagian besar upaya menghalangi tanaman lain digunakan sebagai tanaman  telah gagal. Tetapi entah dengan cara apa, diketahui bahwa dapat mengekstrak energi dari monster tipe tanaman, dan mengapliksikannya pada senjata.
ITEM_20151116_007257	Di dalam lingkungan Lucas Area yang unik, telah dikembangkan equipment untuk melawan Monster type Beast. Setelah hari Medzio Diena sungguh langka area yang tidak mengalami pertumbuhan vegetasi dengan baik seperti Lucas Area, dan hal itu menjadi dasar pembuatan equipment ini.
ITEM_20151116_007258	Kastil dari kerajaan yang dibangun menggunakan tanah dan kayu adalah hal yang langka. Pada area dimana terdapat banyak kastil yang menggunakan bahan material mineral, dan bermutasi menjadi monster adalah hal yang sangat mengganggu, maka dari itu, jika hal itu terjadi kamu membutuhkan senjata dengan efektifitas tinggi.
ITEM_20151116_007259	"Setelah Agailla Flurry menyelesaikan Epitath, memutuskan untuk meninggalkan sesuatu sebagai memorial.
Resep ini tidak dipakai setelah beratus-ratus tahun lamanya seperti telah dilupakan, dan kembali ditemukan setelah hari Medzio Diena terjadi. Pada saat ini dijelaskan bahwa para serangga memiliki kekuatan yang baik dengan teknik Flurry."

ITEM_20151116_007261	Priest tidak muncul sama sekali pada jalan Pilgrim. Class apapun baik Archer, atau Wizard, DLL jika memiliki perasaan mengagumi Goddess, maka adalah Priest selama berdiri di jalan Pilgrim.

ITEM_20151116_007262	"Area Istora pada suatu waktu telah diketahui sebagai tempat pensiun dari para peneliti. Pada saat ini berbagai pertukaran pembelajaran

"
ITEM_20151116_007263	Tujuan dari komitmen lama menjadikan Tenet Church sebagai inti untuk melawan Raja iblis yang datang di masa depan. Para penemu dari pedang ini memiliki niat awal untuk memberikan luka parah kepada Raja Iblis.
ITEM_20151116_007264	Mengekstrak zat berbahaya dengan mencuri energi tanaman kompetitif, lalu mengaplikasikannya pada senjata dengan sihir adalah hal yang sulit. Hal yang dikerjakan 3 tahun untuk mencapai kesuksesan, menggambarkan betapa darurat kondisi yang ada.
ITEM_20151116_007265	Aktifitas binatang buas menjadi lebih kuat setelah hari Medzio Diena pada area yang tidak mengalami vegetasi tanaman terlalu parah. Equipment pun berkembang mencocokan kondisi dari area yang ada, Equipment ini adalah hasil dari pencapaian tersebut.
ITEM_20151116_007266	Batu yang dipakai ketika membangun tembok kastil kota 3 lapis, dan berubah menjadi monster pada hari Medzio Diena adalah hal yang langka. Hal itu adalah karena sejak pertama kali kerajaan didirikan sudah dipersiapkan berbagai hal untuk mengatasi bencana yang akan datang. Tetapi Kastil lainnya yang berada di daerah, tidak memiliki persiapan akan hal itu, sehingga membutuhkan senjata untuk menghadapi Monster yang bermutasi setelah hari Medzio Diena.
ITEM_20151116_007267	Agailla Flurry dapat digunakan oleh orang yang bukan wizard, Senjata ini dibuat sebagai Magic Weapon yang mampu menunjukkan nilainya yang tinggi setelah hari Medzio Diena. Tidak diketahui pasti apakah dia telah memprediksi akan hari Medzio Diena.
ITEM_20151116_007268	Saat ini kita tidak dapat mengetahui kekuatan apa, pada benda apa kekuatan itu ditaruh, dan oleh Goddess siapa pada jaman dahulu di Goddess' Ancient Garden. Tetapi hal itu dapat diperkirakan. Mungkin juga Shoes ini memiliki kekuatan suci dari Goddess Zemyna.
ITEM_20151116_007269	itu jejak Goddess dan keajaiban yang terjadi pada suatu tempat terjadi secara alami. Maka tersebarnya benda yang dibuat itu kepada orang yang berkeliling menjelajahi tempat tersebut adalah hal yang wajar.
ITEM_20151116_007270	Menurut opini sebagian orang-orang radikal, senjata-senjata Istora menggunakan kekuatan yang berasal dari Goddess. Walaupun tidak ada bukti yang jelas.
ITEM_20151116_007271	Tujuan dari komitmen lama menjadikan Tenet Church sebagai inti untuk melawan Raja iblis yang datang di masa depan. Mudah untuk dikontrol, dan pekerjaan pengembangan senjata mematikan bagi kaum demon adalah hal yang sangat multak.
ITEM_20151116_007272	Pada saat dimana tidak ada senjata, pekerjaan menaruh efek menekan tanaman dengan menggunakan tanaman sebagai dasarnya adalah pekerjaan yang lebih sulit. Jika salah maka senjata melemah terlebih dulu sebelum melawan musuh.
ITEM_20151116_007273	Kasus yang diaplikasikan paling pertama akan kekuatan sihir untuk melawan binatang liar di area ini oleh Lucas Lord.
ITEM_20151116_007274	Karena sulit menghadapi para Monster yang bermutasi, maka harus membuat senjata yang lebih kuat dari aslinya dengan menambahkan kekuatan sihir.
ITEM_20151116_007275	Sebelum hari Medzio Diena, jumlah monster tipe serangga sedikit, dan juga tidak terlalu ganas. Waktu itu adalah saat indah dimana dengan senjata yang diperkuat oleh sihir biasa saja sudah cukup bagi seorang magician.
ITEM_20151116_007276	Orang-orang yang mendukung teori penciptaan awal Ruklys dari senjata ini, berkata telah berusaha keras seperti ini untuk memberikan senjata yang layak masing-masing kepada orang dari berbagai tipe yang dikumpulkan dibawahnya sendiri. Orang-orang yang menentang adalah orang yang sungguh luar biasa, tetapi berpikir bahwa tidak memiliki pengalaman luas mengaplikasikan pada senjata dari tipe lainnya.
ITEM_20151116_007277	Sebelum hari Medzio Diena pun, halangan terbesar yang mengganggu para Pilgrim adalah kemunculan dari Demon. Senjata seperti ini sulit untuk dipakai oleh pasukan pengawal, tetapi merupakan sarana yang bisa mudah diintensikan kepada para Pilgrim pada kondisi sulit.
ITEM_20151116_007278	Senjata Istora mendapat banyak perdebatan dari berbagai sisi karena sebenarnya efek senjata ini berpengaruh pada monster mutasi, tetapi juga dikatakan senjata ini memiliki hubungan fundamental kekuatan suci dari Goddess yang bukan kekuatan alam atau sihir.

ITEM_20151116_007280	Para pembuat busur ini membanggakan poin dimana senjata ini dibuat dengan teknik sendiri yang tiada hubungannya dengan Astral Tower pada saat busur busur ini dibuat mereka.
ITEM_20151116_007281	Untuk membuat busur ini, dibutuhkan usaha keras menunggu saat Bracken mekar di tempat yang tidak bisa dilihat oleh siapapun pada waktu khusus. Sebenarnya meletakkan akar pada saat upacara khusus yang menggunakan sihir mengubah kehidupan dari Bracken menjadi kematian.
ITEM_20151116_007282	Menurut opini, ada yang berkata bahwa senjata ini memiliki efek yang reaktif pada bau unik dari binatang.
ITEM_20151116_007283	Senjata Range memiliki fundamental bagian utama dan pelontar dari kekuatan sihir, dan mengantarkan terus menerus kekuatan yang ditentukan, walaupun pemakainya tidak mengatur secara langsung pada proses itu pun, senjata ini dibuat agar beroperasi demikian. Dan juga dibandingkan menaruhnya banyak, alangkah baiknya mengaplikasikan teknik agar kekuatan sihir dapat terpulikan sendiri pada senjata.

ITEM_20151116_007416	Ada beberapa kasus dimana mereka dibuat karena kebutuhan mage. Dikatakan bahwa Turn leather pant dibuat untuk melindungi mage ketika melakukan percobaan dengan petir.
ITEM_20151116_007417	Ada beberapa kasus dimana mereka dibuat karena kebutuhan mage. Dikatakan bahwa Turn leather tunic dibuat untuk melindungi mage ketika melakukan percobaan dengan petir.
ITEM_20151116_007418	Beberapa Turn equipment telah diperkuat atau digunakan dalam berbagai hal saat sedang digunakan di luar Mage Tower. Kasus pertama yang diketahui dari enhancement ini adalah gloves ini.
ITEM_20151116_007419	Ada waktu dimana metallic equipment tidak dibuat karena banyak eksperimen yang dilakukan oleh mage setelah kematian Flurry. Oleh karena itu, metallic Turn equipment yang ada mungkin berasal dari mage tapi telah diselesaikan oleh anonymous contributor di luar Mage Tower.
ITEM_20151116_007420	Tidak  seperti metallic Turn equipment lain, Turn plate legging dibuat oleh mage. Dikatakan bahwa itu digunakan ketika mage sedang berusaha untuk terbang.
ITEM_20151116_007421	Metallic equipment tidak dibuat selama berabad-abad setelah kematian Flurry karena ada kekurangan metal terima kasih atas banyaknya eksperimen oleh para mage. Dengan demikian, meskipun metallic Turn equipment yang ada berasal dari mage, tetapi sebenarnya dibuat oleh orang-orang anonymous dari luar Mage Tower.
ITEM_20151116_007422	Druid Master yang berasal dari Shaton dan mencoba untuk membuat daerah lebih aman setelah Medzio Diena dengan menyediakan atau membantu crafting equipment. Ada kasus dimana non-combatant farmer menerima bantuan dari gloves ini.
ITEM_20151116_007423	Druid Master mengirim beberapa muridnya ke Shaton untuk melakukan berbagai tugas tidak hanya keluar dari kota yang mereka cintai tapi juga karena berkaitan dengan Nature Restoration Plan. Penduduk lokal meniru beberapa magic equipment sederhana yang digunakan menjaga murid aman.
ITEM_20151116_007424	Druid Master tidak melakukan pembatasan pada penduduk Shaton untuk meniru magical equipment yang ia sediakan. Oleh karena itu, beberapa sedang digunakan oleh orang-orang dari daerah tetangga atau petualang, seperti pant ini.
ITEM_20151116_007425	Orang diganggu oleh monster setelah Medzio Diena membutuhkan magical equipment yang mudah didapat. Namun, tidak mudah membantu karena beberapa alasan. Situasi ini cukup buruk kadang-kadang soldier melawan monster di garis depan tidak bisa mendapatkan equipment yang mereka butuhkan. Faktanya Druid Master menggunakan kekuatannya dan resources untuk Shaton region hal kecil tapi mulia.
ITEM_20151116_007426	Shaton equipment memberikan fasilitas beragam untuk mata pencaharian penduduk bahkan jika mereka tidak melawan monster. Bahkan petani dan penebang kayu harus akurat.
ITEM_20151116_007427	Beberapa pendatang dari Shaton region telah menghilang dengan equipment. Tidak jelas apakah mereka kabur setelah mendapatkan equipment atau menjadi korban dari monster. Keduanya sama-sama kemungkinan yang terjadi. Faktanya bahwa mereka yang menghilang telah mendapatkan boots menunjukkan kemungkinan tertentu.
ITEM_20151116_007428	Persentase pendatang di Shaton region dibakar saat jumlah pekerja turun secara dramatis setelah isu tentang outfit ini.
ITEM_20151116_007429	Druid Master juga bebas memberikan bantuan untuk menolong para bangsawan dari Shaton region. Hasilnya, kaum bangsawan Shaton mampu meningkatkan survivability ketika melawan monster.
ITEM_20151116_007430	Beberapa mengungkapkan keprihatinan mereka bahwa cara Druid Master tanpa syarat memberikan magical item untuk kaum bangsawan Shaton mungkin ide yang buruk. Mereka berpendapat bahwa metallic equipment seperti legging ini tidak perlu disediakan. Pada akhirnya, yang lebih penting adalah orang yang menggunakan equipment untuk niat baik atau buruk.
ITEM_20151116_007431	Ada beberapa kepercayaan bahwa lebih penting orang dilindungi dari monster bahkan jika mereka menyalahgunakan niat baik Druid Master. Seperti orang-orang yang memuliakan Druid Master agar menyediakan metallic armor.
ITEM_20151116_007432	Banyak orang telah menemukan berbagai cara untuk menyumbang ke Tyla Monastery yang merupakan sebuah fasilitas religius bersejarah. Donasi ini menjadi dasar munculnya magical equipment unik ke Tyla Monastery.
ITEM_20151116_007433	Beberapa Tyla Monastery equipment ditingkatkan dengan persetujuan dari donor aslinya. Banyak orang menerima manfaat equipment tersebut karena Tyla Monastery tidak memonopoli item tersebut.
ITEM_20151116_007434	Equipment dibuat dengan kekayaan dan magical equipment disumbangkan ke Tyla Monastery sangat membantu orang ketika seluruh region berubah menjadi hutan berduri. Tentu saja orang-orang yang paling diuntungkan adalah para monk dari Monastery.
ITEM_20151116_007435	Alasan mengapa Tyla Monastery menerima kontribusi dan donasi lebih karena secara historis lebih lunak terhadap pelanggar hukum. Tyla Monastery memperlakukan pendosa dan pelanggar hukum sama lembutnya berfokus pada reformasi bukan hukuman yang sesuai tradisi Monastery.
ITEM_20151116_007436	Tyla Monastery mampu memainkan peran itu sebagai sebuah komunitas keyakinan religius bagi para priest untuk waktu yang lama tanpa mengabaikan cita-cita aslinya berkat prinsip itu menjadi ketat terhadap para monk dan toleran terhadap orang luar. Dengan demikian, beberapa magical equipment disini telah digunakan dalam kehidupan sehari-hari bukan untuk bertempur seperti pada daerah lain. Ini adalah contoh yang mewakili equipment tersebut.
ITEM_20151116_007437	Sebelum hari Medzio Diena, tidaklah sulit untuk melakukan kontak dengan Goddess. Pada pendosa yang mengetahui akan nilai dari hal tersebut, berharap menjadi jembatan diantara Goddess dan orang biasa, melalui hal ini orang-orang yang terpengaruh membuat berbagai equipment untuk Tila Abbey dengan menyumbangkan pengabdian mereka pada Tila Abbey.
ITEM_20151116_007438	Magic Equipment yang sepertinya tidak dapat membantu sama sekali akibat iklim dari lokasi Tila Abbey, setelah hari Medzio Diena daerah ini pun juga membutuhkan equipment itu. 
ITEM_20151116_007439	Tilla Abbey termasuk dalam daftar keluarga kerajaan yang banyak beramal. Dari pihak biara tidak ragu-ragu memberikan Magic Item sebagai hadiah dari keluarga kerajaan kepada orang-orang jika dapat membantu, sehingga orang-orang dapat mengenakan Magic Equipment dengan logam yang baik.
ITEM_20151116_007440	Dahulu, ketika keluarga kerajaan menghadiahkan Magic Equipment pada Tila Abbey, keluarga kerajaan tidak memberikan syarat apapun, sehingga Tila Abbey berjanji tidak akan pelit untuk berkontribusi pada dunia walaupun harus menggunakan Magic Equipment. Berkat hal itu sebelum ini banyak orang-orang yang mendapatkan bantuan berupa sepatu.
ITEM_20151116_007441	Salah satu biara Tila yang terdekat setelah hari Medzio Diena Thorn forest tumbuh dengan lebat sehingga pentingnya akan Equipment ini membesar.
ITEM_20151116_007442	Awalnya kekuatan sihir yang terkandung pada equipment ini merupakan jenis yang berbeda katanya. Setelah Medzio Diena maka equipment ini diberikan sihir dengan atribut lainnya akibat pertumbuhan cepat dari Thorn Forest.
ITEM_20151116_007443	Pakaian ini hampir tidak ada perubahan selama 1000 tahun terakhir ini, tampilan luarnya mengarah pada budaya tradisional.
