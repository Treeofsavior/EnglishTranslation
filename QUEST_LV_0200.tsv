QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003428	{memo X}Well.{nl}I don't understand why the food gets rotten whenever I cross there.{nl}.. Is it because of the smoke there?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003429	{memo X}{nl}How would I know about it. If you are going back to Marius, then get rid of those strange things.{nl}I can't do it because I am scared.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003430	Aren't they going to be removed if I rub them with my feet and hands?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003431	{memo X}I will eat this rice cake well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003432	{memo X}In fact, I suspected the smoke.{nl}But as a farmer, I didn't know about it.{nl}I was also scared of those guys who claim that it was made by those barons.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003437	{memo X}It's simple. Please investigate that place a bit, and make sure the crops are growing well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003438	{memo X}Is the task that I requested to you not done yet?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003439	{memo X}Ah, is that so. They are really like that as the baron and Rimas told so.{nl}Thank you.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003441	{memo X}{nl}I will give you this spell scroll. First make it by tieing it with woods and burn it.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003443	{memo X}Ah, I am tired..

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003446	{memo X}Are you the Revelator?{nl}Please do not think about the machine behind me.{nl}Unless you help me with one of my tasks.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003447	{memo X}This machine is being used for an important task.{nl}It is related to the past that isn't that long ago.{nl}The portal that would bring the eternal life and the power that sustains the eternal life..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003448	{memo X}You can only minimize the strange energy surrounding this place by enhancing the seal magic circle.{nl}To do so, we need those empty bottles.{nl}Good luck.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003449	{memo X}Is everything going alright?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003450	{memo X}Very nice.{nl}The machine is going well for sure.{nl}Its all because of you.{nl}And that strange energy is influencing the growth of the crops here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003451	{memo X}I activate the power generator using the fuel that we accumulated in that storage.{nl}That's why we needed more grains.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003452	{memo X}{nl}It is so fortunate that the farmers are helping us without resistance.{nl}..Anyways, recently that storage is being attacked by the monsters so we worry about it.{nl}I guess its not strange since the grains are piled up there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003453	{memo X}I can only say that the power generator helps to keep the gate open which leads to an important place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003454	{memo X}I don't know when those monsters appear again so I can't leave this place. I can't also let the baron do it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003455	{memo X}It will be quite for some time. {nl} Thanks.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003469	{memo X}{nl}The baron is very kind.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003470	{memo X}Even if this place belongs to the baron, this place is too infertile and the monsters also took the seeds..{nl}So, can you retrieve the seeds that were taken by the monsters?{nl}I put them well in my pocket..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003471	{memo X}I need more seeds.. Can you get me some more?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003472	{memo X}I don't know who took it. We should catch them all.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003474	{memo X}Yes. That's right. Thanks.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003475	{memo X}Now we have some seeds. Thank you so much.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003476	{memo X}Ah, that's right.{nl}There are many ways to enhance the magic circle.{nl}It is always a problem that I can't go since I can't leave the baron and this magic power generator behind.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003477	{memo X}{nl}Okay. Take these and scatter them.{nl}This is one of the methods for the enhancement. I made it to prepare times like this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003478	{memo X}Use the poison to enhance the magic circle?..{nl}I am not sure if its right, but let's try it anyways.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003479	{memo X}I've collected that poison from the monsters.{nl}The monsters are very vicious and hard.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003480	{memo X}Benius

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003495	{memo X}The monsters have something that looks like a hard core.{nl}That is harder than a stone so if one gets hit by that, its quite lethal.{nl}And I think it would be better to get those from the monsters instead of getting stones here where the stones are not hard enough.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003496	{memo X}We will take care of our own tasks
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003497	{memo X}That's enough.{nl}Thank you so much.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003501	{memo X}I am sorry that I had to make you do this kind of work.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003502	{memo X}Farming tools are used to plowing the fields so they can be also used in battles.{nl}But we would definitely need the help from the farmers..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003503	{memo X}Show the letter that I gave to you and if you successfully persuade them, you would be able to receive their farming tools.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003504	I hope the farmers don't request something big..

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003519	{memo X}The problem is that the food storage gets attacked by the monsters frequently.{nl}Please help me a bit.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003535	{memo X}Just think that the monsters don't have brains.{nl}They are not on the baron side and they are also not on our side.{nl}They always cause troubles and they disturb our tasks.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003536	{memo X}I feel so relieved to see that you are so enthusiastic.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003537	{memo X}We are almost there! The moment of restoration!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003538	There are lots of tasks to do for the restoration.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003542	{memo X}First, I should glue these pieces together. Can you get me some sticky fluid from the monsters?{nl}I will try to glue them with it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003543	{memo X}{nl}I feel.. I feel like ruining the divinity, but I have no choice since I am running out of the supplies.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003544	{memo X}We don't have enough sticky fluid.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003545	{memo X}Okay that would be enough. Give it to me.{nl}I will try to glue them together.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003547	{memo X}I mean, we should take the monster to the magic circle down there.{nl}In order to succeed the experiment, it would be better to extract the half of the blood from it.{nl}And then make it react to the magic circle.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003548	{memo X}You are understanding correctly right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003549	{memo X}Yes.{nl}It really was like that. Monsters fall into the eternal sleep.. dying..{nl}The monsters are dying due to the energy coming from there..

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003557	{memo X}Starting from the one day, those barons' plunderings increased a lot and many magic circles were created a lot. Somehow, some of them were less shiny.{nl}Anyways, when you get near the bright ones, it will be hard to eliminate them since you may get hurt.{nl}Of course, the most difficult task is to avoid the eyes of the barons and continue to do this task.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003569	{memo X}There is an unstable sealed magic circle down there. {nl}The baron told me that the seal which prevents the strange energy spurting out from the places nearby is not perfect yet so the energy is leaking out. However, the problem is that it doesn't look like that.{nl}It is suspicious.{nl}Now we have to tie up these pieces, so can you find more about the energy on behalf of me?

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007148	Our comrades who were attacked by Stone Frosts... they are just left there without avoiding the rain and the wind.{nl}On top of that, we have a limited support... We have no choice, but to wait.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007149	But those damn monsters! They are attacking our colleagues.{nl}Please. Could you be with our colleagues to protect them for a while?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007150	My old friend, Galen is one of the victims.{nl}Please protect him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007151	Thank you so much.{nl}I hope the reinforcement comes soon so he could return to his family even if he is petrified.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007152	We didn't treat them badly, but they betrayed us.{nl}Dico Thieves stole the supplies from us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007153	{memo X}They must have taken them to Drasa worship ruins, but since I can't leave this place, I guess we all gonna die.{nl}I am sorry, but can you retrieve the supplies that were stolen by the thieves?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007154	A few decades ago, the thieves attacked the guard camp or stole the supplies secretly.{nl}They were punished for doing so, but I guess they forgot about it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007155	They lured us in front of them and stole the objects from behind.{nl}We should set something up, but our chiefs are fighting against Kaliss Knights.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007156	We have one more trouble.{nl}I mean Sabina, who is a Knight of Kaliss.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007157	They are insisting that they would not go back until they find the damaged artifacts.{nl}We can't get out from this place so I don't know what they want us to do...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007158	The city that was destroyed a few hundreds years ago has no assets or no people to protect.{nl}I rather feel like protecting a historical site. Even tomb thieves are here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007159	Now, I just hope Sabina stays calm.{nl}We don't want to be like them here because of the Stone Frosts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007160	It's not an easy thing to ditch the kingdom soldiers.{nl}I want to know the truth here. The truth which the soldiers really hate about.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007161	I need your help since you don't seem to belong to any side.{nl}Could you make rubber copies of the records that are remaining here?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007162	These are the records from the time when the fortress of the earth collapsed.{nl}We could maybe know more about the fortress of the earth from the headquarter of Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007163	But, the Fortress of the Earth can't be entered because the kingdom soldiers are restricting the access.{nl}Even the Knights of Kaliss.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007164	Maybe... we could restore the time of the portal that was used when we retreated from the fortress of the earth.{nl}It is dangerous from this point on so if you are going to quit, please tell me now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007165	What we are planning right now could lead us to the gallows.{nl}Please keep it secret.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007168	I heard the Dico Thieves were well known thieves.{nl}I heard that they were seperated on Medzio Diena... Anyways... what they are doing is like what bandits are doing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007169	I also know that there are thieves called Amanda Thieves. They were quiet.{nl}I want to know if they really exist or not since I never saw them before.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007170	Both of them are criminals that we should catch when we receive more reinforcements.{nl}Especially, Dico Thieves.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007171	We are observing what the researchers of the Knights of Kaliss are doing, and while pretending to be their guards.{nl}Sabina was one of them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007172	They disappear and appear again using the artifacts that are remaining in the city so I have troubles chasing after them.{nl}But, were Chronomancers the people who investigate the portals?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007173	I really appreciate for your kindness, but it's not going to be easy. If it was easy, we would've found them already.{nl}I don't know why, but the monsters ate the artifacts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007174	$This place is the cursed city of the traitor, Ruklys.{nl}It has been cursed with Stone Frost since the end of the rebellion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007175	$We will permit your entry since the Knights of Kaliss requested us to do so,{nl}but please remain at places where we can keep an eye out for you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007176	$I don't know how great you were in the past,{nl}but you have to follow the rules of the kingdom here.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007178	If you could defeat the monsters in the ruins, that will be the way to contribute to the Goddessses and the kingdom.{nl}Of course, I promise you some rewards in return.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007179	It will not be bad to show us a good impression.{nl}Because this land is ruled by the kingdom soldiers.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007180	It wasn't done by the thieves. We are moving the objects to the places where they could find more values.{nl}It will be way better than disappearing from here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007181	Not bad.{nl}I guess the rumors don't always get exaggerated.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007182	We are activating the detectors here because of irregular pertrified frosts that are blowing,{nl}but, there are no soldiers who could check that due to a recent battle.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007183	So if you could do that for us,{nl}that will be the way to be loyal to the kingdom and continue the determination.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007184	There are monsters who try to go after the soldiers who maintain the device.{nl}Be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007185	The stone frosts are to be blown from the two places.{nl}I heard you are a quite famous Revelator. Aren't you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007186	From some time ago, more soliders are being attacked by Sparnashorn near the detectors.{nl}If you are the one from the rumor, you would be able to face against that monster.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007187	Those soldiers are the ones who survived from the Stone Frosts and Sparnashorn.{nl}They can't fight against Sparnashorn since they are blind due to fear. They also have no chance of defeating Sparnashorn.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007188	The Stone Frosts are delayed a bit.{nl}Whatever we do, there is no way to block the punishements that were brought by Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007189	Now the only thing that is remaining is Sparnashorn... Defeat it quickly and get outta from there.{nl}Even a greateste Revelator would not withstand the Stone Frosts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007190	Retreating is also a tactic, but we can't always do it.{nl}We should finish it when we have an volunteer who is loyal and competent like you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007191	Hearing that it was defeated is the most hopeful story I've heard in years. {nl}Now I better let the troops rest first and tell them the good news.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007192	Although I don't know you, I am glad to see you.{nl}It's good to be acquainted with someone here. Everyone should help each other out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007193	For example, help cleaning the monsters at our workplace.{nl}The gathering place. What do you think? Can you help us?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007194	The kind of work I do is business secret so I can't tell you what it is.. {nl}No one owns these things anyway. Finders keep them if them if they need them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007195	That fast? Have you not missed any of the monsters?{nl}Ahah. Those coward kingdom soldiers won't get near here so don't worry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007196	You want to know how I got here? {nl}It's all becuase I have connections. There are some kingdom soldiers who buy claws of the monsters to raise their work records.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007197	But actually, I don't want to be around those monsters. Especially here.{nl}If you could get me those claws, we will become really good friends.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007198	I think you are misunderstanding something.{nl}We are archeologists, not thieves.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007199	Thank you so much friend.{nl}This seems quite pricy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007200	I will tell you something. You better not think about getting something here.{nl}Aside from us, there is the outrageous Dico Thieves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007201	I don't want to see them more than those kingdom soldiers.{nl}The goods they brought here from outside are piled up at the entrance route of the outer wall... {nl}What would occur if they all disappear?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007202	I took a sneak peek, but it seems they haven't returned yet.{nl}Move fast.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007203	Seems like Dico Thieves are planning to do their business bigger than I thought. {nl}That's an enormous amount. Do you think they also have connections with the kingdom army?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007204	The terrible scene you can see in this city are the results of the rebellion that was carried out by Ruklys and the citizens 600 years ago.{nl}The Stone Frosts that started to blow after suppressing the rebellion turn everything into stones.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007205	The kingdom would've been destroyed already if Premier Eminent wasn't present.{nl}If he was still alive... We may have got over these hard times sooner.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007206	That's the scary wind that turns everything into stones.{nl}After Medzio Diena, the occurence of the wind changed irregularly.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007207	Once you encounter the curse of the Stone Frosts, you can't restore it.{nl}The sin of the traitor, Ruklys is that heavy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007208	The Knights of Kaliss is trying to find a remedy...{nl}The curse continued for 600 years. I don't think there's a remedy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007209	Sparnashorn appears with the wind of Stone Frosts.{nl}To avoid the exhausted soldiers not get involved with it, we should avoid them fighting against Sparnashorn.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007210	If we could eliminate the weak Stone Frosts with this absorbing scroll at the great square, we may delay the time a bit.{nl}We would be able to lure Sparnashorn to the old market when the next Stone Frosts blow.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007211	I've a friend who's supposed to come here but he's nowhere to be found.{nl}I think something happened.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007212	He is hiding among the guards near the great square.{nl}This water bottle has a code on it. If you give it to the guards, he'll know and talk to you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007213	He is hiding among the guards.{nl}This water bottle has a code on it. If you give it to the guards, he'll know and talk to you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007214	Hush! Lower your voice. It will be the end of both of us if we get caught.{nl}Did that stupid Juvertas send you here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007215	I told him many times that I'd go back if I'm done with my work here.{nl}There is a big problem here actually.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007216	Our family can't come into the city from outside.{nl}We can't bring in my family without the troops knowing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007217	I'm going to make big fuss at the great square. I'm going to call in Saltistter that are roaming around the area. {nl}In order to do this, you need to gathere scented stone powder from the monsters. Can you do it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007218	Our families should have passed this place earlier than the kingdom army. {nl}But Retia hurried things when the Stone Frosts swept by some time ago so we weren't able to.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007219	If you pour this here, you will soon see the Saltistter show up its huge body itself.{nl}But that is not our plan.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007220	We should not make this place a battlefield. Then our families can't pass through.{nl}Let's rub this powder onto the Rambears that appear at the great square.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007221	Then Saltistter will attack Rambears. {nl}Retia will not just stand and watch her area be invaded like that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007222	Our families come from various areas.{nl}I was also once a junior officer with dreams to become a strategist.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007223	Of course, it was before the area I was assigned to completely disappeared from the map on Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007224	Did you use everything?{nl}Then now it's time to get busy!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007225	Go to Retia and tell her that Saltistter is coming here.{nl}She won't believe it but I can already feel the Saltistter running at us. {nl}Hurry!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007226	You just have to tell her that Saltistter is coming.{nl}There is no reason for her to suspect us.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007227	Our families passed through this place without any problems.{nl}Since you are still being trusted by our kingdom soldiers, you will not be discovered.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007228	This city... you will find many interesting truths if you continue your journey in this area.{nl}And you may also meet our families.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007229	I don't want to be here either.{nl}I would not be here if I didn't receive the orders to support the Kalis knights...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007230	Kostas has not come back for days so I can't leave this place.{nl}Also the mosnters are running wild so I can't just stay still.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007231	$We have to be here until Kostas comes back.{nl}There are lot of things to do, so I hope he comes back soon.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007232	The officers don't like the Knights of Kaliss. {nl}As for lower rank guards like me, Kaliss knights give us supplies and supports so there's no reason for us to hate them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007233	If we can find the Symbol of Schilt, then we would be able to enter the area without any problems.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007234	I can't hear anything from Kostas.{nl}Ah... I don't know how I should report.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007235	$The kingdom soldiers, the Knights of Kaliss, and we graverobbers are forming an excellent balance.{nl}That's why people can at least walk around.. Before that, this place was not a place to stay.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007237	I can't leave my post since Kostas is not here.{nl}You can find many records if you look around the trade area so I want you to take care of them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007238	Don't mind what's written on the records. {nl}It's all nonsense.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007239	I have to escort, clean up, and guard. I wonder how they are expecting me to do everything alone. {nl}It's a good thing you came to help.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007240	It is an old story,{nl}but many kingdom soldiers came to this place to do a preliminary check to support for the research of Kalis Knightage.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007241	But, unlike their expectations, the Stone Frosts were waiting for them.{nl}They died there... I want to get their keepsakes, but it's hard...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007242	The authorities do not take it well that tens of soldiers were sacrificed for support activities. {nl}That's why the kingdom army and Kalis knights have become distant.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007243	Good thing I was off duty that day.. I don't even want to think about it.{nl}I will deliver this to the families of the deceased.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007244	Gofden...{nl}The symbol of Schilt... Ah sorry I talked alone in front of you.{nl}When you are carrying this, you will not receive the curse of the Stone Frosts. Don't you think it's amazing?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007245	People say you go around to save the world according to the will of Goddess?{nl}Then you could save also save this city!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007246	Our employer does not support us any other funds besides the research funds to revive the city.{nl}That's why the wizards like me, who want to come up with some results are researching while avoiding the eyes of the kingdom soldiers and the Knights of Kaliss.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007247	This will be enough.{nl}Good. Let's combine this with the Symbol of Schilt.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007248	We've succeeded the combination... but I can't predict how effective this would be.{nl}I will give you the symbol of schilt so try using it on the monsters in this area.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007249	If it's effective, then something would react to it.{nl}Maybe since the effects for the Stone Frosts disappeared, it could take little faster. Anyways, I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007250	Since I handed over the symbol of schilt to you, I am gonna be dead when the Stone Frosts blow here.{nl}Please finish the task as quickly as possible.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007251	So it was effective right?{nl}Then now, I will amplify it!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007252	Ah... I almost forgot.{nl}Even if I amplify the symbol of schilt with the reacting stone, the power doesn't last eternally.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007253	{memo X}Good, good... I will activate it only when the Stone Frosts blow.{nl}I should obtain the detector somewhere.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007254	{memo X}If you could bring me the detector, I will do the rest.{nl}You've contributed a lot in this experiment so I will give you the effects of the symbol of schilt.{nl}Although it woud not last long...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007255	There were attempts in the past.{nl}Ruxona reconstruction agency, they had a seperate laboratory room to research on the curse of the Stone Frosts.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007256	But then demons rushed in...{nl}Most of them were killed by the demons or became petrified on the experimental devices.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007257	This symbol of schilt... it reminds me of many things.{nl}It was too bad since the results of the experiments were appearing at that time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007258	They told me to protect the objects that are gathered at Gerove Workshop Site.{nl}Do you think this makes sense? Why don't they ask the monsters to protect?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007259	Ah! We should just do it like that.{nl}Hey, could you help me a bit?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007260	It's a good thing the cowardly Dico Thieves did not reach here yet.{nl}Things are limited but people are coming in flocks to take them away..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007261	If it's cleared up that much, then looks like I can start already.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007262	There are some boxes that our thieves left at Gerove Workshop.{nl}When you rub Bellas grass onto them, the monsters would rush in.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007263	But, you gotta be careful.{nl}The monsters would not treat you preciously so run away after attaking them a little.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007264	I think I can leave this place for a while because of you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007265	You haven't seen Dico Thieves right?{nl}In fact, I haven't seen them as well, but Amanda told you to be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007266	Please take care of the monsters in the military district while I prepare the test. {nl}We should not be caught or interfered.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007267	It's relatively safe on top of the fortress.{nl}There are monsters and thieves swarming if you leave this place.{nl}Of course, the kingdom soldiers as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007268	$I don't like it, having to guard here with the Knights of Kaliss around.{nl}You will never understand what it feels like to guard here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007269	Until now, I am sure that you've only seen the artifacts that stopped their time.{nl}But, it will be different from this point on since I came here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007270	I will proceed the test from up here.{nl}Please go to the portal and activate it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007271	Don't worry too much.{nl}Everything is just your memories at then so they won't do any harms to you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007272	I am sorry. Aren't you hurt somewhere?{nl}I didn't know it would go over my expectations.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007273	What was that... demons? Are they really demons?{nl}I have no way of knowing. I guess I will have to tune up the portal that leads to the Earth Fortress.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007274	It is little dangerous... but, I want to suggest a deal to you.{nl}We are actually cooperating with Amanda thieves. Yes. I know it's insane.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007275	To obtain what you want, you should take this risk.{nl}Just help Amanda thieves to enter into the city.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007276	{memo X}Would dead people come back if the curse is cured in this city?{nl}No, but the times after now are more important.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007277	We feel like we are risking our lives every seconds.{nl}But we continuously watch over so that nothing will go wrong.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007278	We're different from those Dico Thieves.{nl}If you help well this time, I will surely pay you back someday.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007279	The guards were asking what the fuss was all about so I told them about you. {nl}Everything should be alright.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007280	If you watch over the city from here, it feels like the time has stopped.{nl}However, many incidents are occurring everyday.{nl}{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007285	Steponas will pass by secretly.{nl}Of course, you will receive their respects.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007286	Rofdel will be watching from the watchtower but on a foggy day like this, it's useless.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007288	The guards won't mention our names to Rofdel.{nl}What they have been taking until now was all against the military law.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007290	I have a request. Please gather the propagandas which the kingdom soliders spreaded at then.{nl}When we compare those with the records that we've gathered, we will find something lacking.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007291	As the defeat of Ruklys became more and more concrete, the kingdom soldiers spreaded the propagandas more.{nl}There must be some propagandas left in the Stone Frosts as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007292	They made such embarassing stories sound like a heroic epic to the ignorant people. {nl}600 years have passed, but they are still embarassing.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007294	I need your help. I need a more powerful bomb.{nl}The frost core that I promised with the Knights of Kaliss is inside the body of Stone Froster.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007295	Just do as I told you. {nl}If it's not the bomb, we can't pull out the frost core.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007296	The purity level is not satisfactory.{nl}It could take some time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007297	Since we don't have the fuse, it was made to explode when it gets hit.{nl}I will give you this so I want you to test it on the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007298	If we can't get this done, we can't even start with the next step.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007299	It won't explode right away and explosion is not steady.{nl}What to do..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007300	It should stick to the monster in order to secure the time to explode with a bam.{nl}Can you get the kneaded mucus of the monsters in Viskas?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007301	I'll say it again but this is the only way to keep you safe.{nl}Hmm? Of course you should throw it. I am busy.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007307	If you are going to be near here, please come to me. {nl}I could cast a spell on you to protect you from the Stone Frosts.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007310	Then they will turn into stones.{nl}The aristocrats in the big cities get deceived by them and they buy them at expensive prices.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007311	There are stones that constantly float down the Vadova port.{nl}It is the record of the rebellion from 600 years ago.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007312	The records contain the contents that discourage the soldiers so the officers destroyed them from time to time.{nl}But, since we don't have enough workforce, I want you to take care of them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007313	I don't understand how these heavy stuffs float down here and make us dizzy.{nl}I will probably use them when we repair the watchtower.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007314	Whenever the Stone Frosts blow, the number of soldiers decreases, but the kingdom doesn't possess additional soldiers to support.{nl}That's why we ask the graverobbers or the refugees to join the military.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007315	Only thing I can do is to attach these leaflets around here.{nl}I hope you could help me by thinking that you are supporting the kingdom.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007316	I'm sure people taking the leaflets but the number of applicants have decreased recently. {nl}Is it because the graverobbers started checking inside. Isn't it suspicious?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007317	When a person like Premier Eminent appears again, I'm sure that the kingdom will flourish quickly.{nl}I will pray to the Goddesses that you could be an important person like him.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007321	I heard you have lots of battle experiences.{nl}I even want to suggest you to join the Knights of Kaliss.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007322	I believe that there is no curse in this world that can't be cured.{nl}With all my faith, I will discover the cure.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007323	You're as great as the rumors say. {nl}Kalis Knightage need heroes like you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007324	This is an interesting place. {nl}This city is filled with things to experiment.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007325	Stone debris and dust blow a lot in this area so many soldiers and knights cough severly. {nl}The knightage headquarters send us refreshing candies mixed with medicinal herbs.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007327	I would like to give you some if we have extras. {nl}Even the graverobbers are preying on the candies.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007328	I won't blame you if you eat one secretly. {nl}But you don't seem to be that kind of a person.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007329	Soldiers patrolling this area were swept by stone frost while passing by Stalactite square some time ago.{nl}We are only affiliated to kingdom army but we're mostly residents of Kalis province.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007330	I want to help my folks from back home, but there is no way to get them out of the curse. {nl}We can only get their last will and keepsakes for their families. {nl}Won't you show your kindness for them before they lose their conciousness?

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007332	In order to restore the city, the Kalis Knights hired many experts.{nl}But they just recruit people without any support afterwards.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007333	In order to continue the research, I seriously need your help.{nl}If we could make the miraculous medicine that would drag out the controlled spirit, we may able to find out the source of the curse.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007334	Besides the knowledge of the spells I possess, I am trying to approach it with various methods.{nl}I will lift this curse for sure.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007335	That's enough ingredients to make elixir of freedom. {nl}Now, let's start.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007336	I will give you this freedom elixir. Use it on the petrified victims at Vienti Fortress.{nl}Their souls trapped in the body might tell you something about what they last witnessed.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007337	The angry souls might attack you.{nl}Please be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007338	There was nothing to find out about other than the fact that they were all in panic and feat when dying. {nl}I guess I better look for even older victims.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007339	{memo X}We can't even find the traces of the bodies of the victims who were sacrificed on the day of Ruklys' rebellion due to Stone Frosts.{nl}But, that angry souls are deeply permeated into the city.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007340	{memo X}Please light the fire at the incense burner that I set at Vienti Fortress with the Knightage.{nl}The angry souls will tell you the story of that day.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007341	{memo X}Please do not stimulate the angry souls.{nl}Since they are unstable, I don't know how they would react.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007342	Pains, anger... betrayer and fear...{nl}I can still feel the feelings from that day.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007343	But, they are not towards humans.{nl}It's as if something deep and dark... I am going to go back to the knightage and find out more about it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007344	Even trees or paper turn into stones besides living creatures...{nl}I am very interested in these non-senses. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007345	{memo X}If you could help me...{nl}Maybe we could save them even if they are cursed with the petrification. Although they may lose their arms.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007346	Even if it works on just one or two from ten of them, that would be great.{nl}I trust on my knowledge and skills.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007347	You weren't able to save any of them? {nl}I guess this is not a good way. I will take back what is left.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007348	I think we should use different drugs and test as much as we can. {nl}But then we will need a lot of samples.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007349	Can you defeat the monsters in Nevekia Fortress and get me petrified samples?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007350	This should be enough for about five tests. Good work.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007351	To tell you one more time, the curse of the petrification is a chemical reaction so I don't think you would be able to restore it.{nl}If you could come to me fast, then you will save your life even if you lose one of your legs.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007352	May those victims rest in peace.{nl}However, like the river that attracts those who are thirsty, this place is astounding for me and my thirst for knowlege.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007353	There's a dumb monster that is ruining the beautiful place on the top of Nebekia Fortress.{nl}I want you to take care of him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007354	It if has a brain, how can it go around ruining this? {nl}Oh well, maybe that's why it's a monster.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007355	{memo X}Did you defeat it? Great job!{nl}Now I don't have to fear this place being torn down until another monster shows up.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007356	The Stone Frosts just swept by so we should get to work quickly.{nl}We can see when and where the Stone Frosts start by checking whether the soldiers are retreating or not.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007357	And the quickest way to receive the information is to become a kingdom soldier.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007358	I am not sure since I am a low ranking soldier.{nl}This place originally belongs to Kaliss.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007359	This place belonged to the kingdom, but due to rebellions, 600 years have passed.{nl}Everyone thinks that the Knights of Kaliss will make a movement again soon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007360	But, even in this situation, there aren't any conflicts...{nl}The objective of the people who were dispatched here is on the research like Kostas so how would a low rank soldier like me know anything.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007361	According to what senior officers say, they are not offically belonged to the army, but they are rather somewhat more like mercenaries.{nl}I am not sure, but they asked me about many things on the Stone Frosts.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007362	Many people from the Knights of Kaliss actually came here to continue on their research besides Kostas.{nl}What would they want from the city of rebel forces... Isn't it strange?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007363	I don't know well since I am a low ranked soldier, but it seems that they don't like each other.{nl}I understand since they are trying to make a move after managing it for 600 years. Who would like it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007364	But, the Knights of Kaliss are saying that it's their fair right and they also said they are going to concentrate on the research so we can't say anything.{nl}What I've heard was to guard them and report their whereabouts... but, then they disappeared again.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007365	I've obtained it by paying a large sum to the kingdom soldiers so just take a look at it without touching it.{nl}Due to the petrified places, this place turned into a land which no living creatures could live for hundreds of years.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007366	But the lives are great. {nl}I predict that the small number of monsters that used to live here became resistant by being exposed to weak Stone Frosts.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007367	The crystals that grow inside the special monsters could unleash the power that could face against strong Stone Frosts.{nl}However, the problem is that they get discovered only one in several hundreds or even thousands... That's a pity.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007368	Thanks.{nl}We would be able to lift the curse of the petrification if we could amplify this ethereal power.{nl}Please first get me the reacting stones from the monsters at Palaikai Intersections. I am counting on you!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007369	Thanks.{nl}The petrification detectors that are left by the kingdom soldiers are scattered across Palaikai Intersections.{nl}Among them, please get me the ones that only react to the symbol of schilt.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007370	Ever since I came here, I feel like someone is keep looking at me.{nl}Anyways, see you again after the work is done.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007371	When it gets more apparent in the future, then there would an opportunity to show it to you.{nl}We need to collect more documents.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007372	For now, all I can tell you is that some different objective is involved with the rebellion of Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007373	The kingdom soldiers forbid anyone in this city from probing into Ruklys.{nl}Anyone who still does that could be treated as a traitor so they educate the soldiers firmly.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007374	But as they hide more and more, more people will be curious about Ruklys.{nl}The gallows could be near, but how could a scholar just do nothing?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007375	You are so brave.{nl}According to the records, there are 10 portals in total. Among them, four of them are near here.{nl}Could you find out if they are still activating?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007376	Please get me the hardened gunpowder from the monsters near the watermill ruins.{nl}Let's make special explosives using that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007377	I am going to bring in the thieves in through the central city area. {nl}While you are doing so, if you get encountered by a monster, you will soon get caught by the guards.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007378	That's why I want you to act first at the Estuary Bank Three Way.{nl}Unlike Dico Thieves, they pay back to the people they owed to so they will help your journey for sure.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007379	I don't know if you know the relationship between the soldiers and the Knights of Kaliss, but{nl}anyways, the soldiers are looking for something that they can never have.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007380	That's why they need the graverobbers. {nl}Of course, it is risky to cooperate with the thieves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007381	Even so, it is very valuable.{nl}And for the future, the relationship with the thieves will be useful.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007382	Please use the Berserk powder on the monsters at the Estuary Bank Three Way.{nl}The monsters won't stand at all and go crazy. It will make a quite mess.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007383	The information should sometimes be leaked, hid or modified in order to have some values.{nl}We could also make connections with different people by doing so.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007384	People say history is the record of the winners. I think so too.{nl}Have you seen the tombstones that are still remaining on the ruins near Fedimian?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007385	If what the soldiers are spreading is true, then there are many doubts on the records that are remaining here.{nl}And the behaviors of the soliders that are trying to destroy them are also strange.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007386	Throw this against the monsters.{nl}If you are lucky enough, it will explode with a bam!, but if that's not it, you will make them angry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007387	Please collect the dark crystals from the monsters at Vienti Fortress.{nl}I will try to make an elixir that would pull out the controlled spirit.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007388	Thanks. First, would you use this melting solution to the monsters that are struggling due to the Stone Frosts?{nl}I mean Nebekia Fortress. If it's useful, you would be able to use it on the humans as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007389	I personally think the curse of the petrification is a chemical reaction.{nl}Which means you can't restore the things that are once petrified before.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007390	Even if, Bokor over there tries his best, he won't be able to restore it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007391	But, if the petrification is in progress,{nl}Then I think we may able to save the rest even if we lost the parts that have already become petrified.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007392	Almost all curses disappear when the casters die.{nl}I think the curse of the petrification is the same as the case in the way of the pilgrim.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007393	But the curse descended for 600 years.{nl}This means the caster of the curse also has lived for 600 years.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007394	But, if we could find out the true identitiy of the caster, we may push it with stronger power.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007395	$Kostas doesn't seem to be scared.{nl}Yet I am scared even though I've worked here for a long time. I don't have a clue where he went...

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007399	I am sure there's a way to lift the curse completely.{nl}Although, it seems that Saliamonas has given up.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007400	I am sure there are hidden facts.{nl}Although I don't know what they are.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007401	This city would feel like lost families to the people of Kaliss.{nl}I am sure there's a way to restore the city.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007402	A few of them are mercenaries, but they are also the people of Kaliss.{nl}The way they look at this city will be the same.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007403	$The graverobbers are going all out here.{nl}We have to wait for extra support from headquarters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007404	I don't give false hopes to other people.{nl}I just want to find more realistic method.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007405	Were you deceived all this time?{nl}If we rub Bellas leaves on the boxes, monsters protect them as if they are something precious.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007406	Good. Please get me Bellas leaves at the commerce district.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007407	$My heart aches to see my colleagues that are just left out there against the elements after succumbing to the Stone Frost...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007408	I don't like the kingdom soldiers.{nl}They look at us like traitors for what happened 600 years ago.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007409	Now is the time to retrieve our land.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007410	We can't clearly see it on the days like today when the stone debris are blowing a lot.{nl}But, when it rains, you can clearly see Ruklys Street.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007411	Disciple Raius
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007412	We would be able to find the inheritance of the master if we try little more...{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007414	While I was coming here, I saw the leaflets that encourage people to join the military.{nl}Rip them off all. They are good for sneezing.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007415	Since I don't know what the master has in his mind before he passed away, I am worried.{nl}No one would understand my mind.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007714	Look at this. This is the silk that was used in this trap.. I believe I've seen it before.{nl}If someone got his hands on the supplies of the monastery, we can think of only one person.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007715	Good.{nl}After retrieving the monastery, I will tell the abbot about this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007716	The captain sent you here?{nl}It's about time that reliable support came to me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007717	You will have to persuade the other brothers besides me.{nl}There is a place nearby called Viltis Forest. Senior Monk Marko can be found there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007718	Something big happened at the monastery.{nl}Would you be able to help us?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007719	I think I've lost my precious scripture while I was running away.{nl}But, I also have to take care of our brothers.. Can you look for them? I don't care if you only find the pages.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007720	If you can't find them, then we would have to accept it.{nl}People's lives are more important than the pages of the scripture.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007721	So they are ripped off..{nl}I guess we have no other choice. Please, let's first concentrate on curing my brothers.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007722	It's the worst case scenario.{nl}The forest is covered with thorns and there are traps everywhere.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007723	And my brothers are suffering because of the poison.{nl}If the threat of the monsters lowers down, I would be relaxed enough to finish the cure.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007724	Who made all these traps?{nl}I don't feel very well seeing my brothers suffer.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007725	Thank you so much.{nl}I will now pray for our brothers for a full recovery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007726	Since I quickly ran away from the monastery, I wasn't able to bring many things with me.{nl}I should somehow feed some nutritious food to our brothers who are suffering from the poison..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007727	Thank you so much.{nl}There is a mushroom called Tempas. It grows really fast.{nl}Please get me some of those from Juklas Sunny Place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007728	You will find it when you walk diligently.{nl}They are usually hidden in the ground.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007729	Thanks.{nl}I will pray to the Goddesses that they will be okay after eating this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007730	Since I am not feeling well right now, I do want to prepare in advance.{nl}If you are going to hunt for monsters nearby, could you please listen to my request?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007731	Please collect the stone legs of the Rocktors.{nl}I can use those for my arrowheads.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007732	The stone legs of Roctors near this are usable.{nl}Other things are somewhat soft.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007733	This many.. Thank you so much.{nl}It will be good if we return to the place where the captain is, but we should first finish our mission.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007734	I think the monsters found out that I have suffered from the poison.{nl}They are slowly narrowing the gap. This could be dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007735	Let's use Jareth.{nl}Even if you stand in front, they may rush in when you leave.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007736	Please hunt for the monsters with Jareth.{nl}After they engage in combat, the monsters will be scared if Jareth unleashes its smell.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007737	Jareth is old, but very brave.{nl}Sometimes he has the tendency to attack first because of his bravery..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007738	Did Jareth do well?{nl}Now we can worry less about the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007739	We should retrieve the monastery.{nl}If we don't move fast, the abbot will be in danger.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007740	The abbot here is called Marko and he leads the monastery here.{nl}But, he is too stubborn. He is too difficult.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007741	I will support here with all I could so I hope you pass my position.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007742	I should've persuaded him slowly, but I think we were in a rush.{nl}But, it was that important...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007743	You are a different person. Even so, no is no.{nl}They are very rude. They know the circumstances well, and Evoniphon...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007744	And the abbot is locked in the monastery.{nl}Unless we retrieve the monastery, do not mention about the deportation.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007745	If retrieving monastery is more important, that's good.{nl}If they approve, we will support with everything we can.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007746	You should first help those monks.{nl}They should have more than one person in trouble. You should do favors for them first.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007747	Hunters will step up first. They should have done that in the first place.{nl}Then, I have something to request to you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007748	We were preparing to retrieve the monastery ourselves.{nl}Please let our brothers down there know that Hunters are helping.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007749	I shall wait for Boros. I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007750	Do not think bad about us.{nl}We should first retrieve the monastery, but they are only talking about Evoniphon so we don't feel comfortable.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007751	We have a problem. {nl}One of the monks have been suffering to the poison of Evoniphon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007752	He is breathing, but he is becoming stiff.{nl}What should we do about this...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007753	This place is dangerous.{nl}Be cautious at all times.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007754	We've passed the dangerous situation with an emergency procedure, but...{nl}If we don't detoxify it completely, there will be more crises.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007755	But, I saw this poison for the first time.{nl}While I am taking care of him, please get me the other poison so I could compare.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007756	What we should obtain is the poison from thorns of Chafferors
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007757	The poison must have been made using stuff that can be found around this area. {nl}Please hurry before it's too late.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007758	It is so fortunate that we discovered it before it's too late.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007759	You are not too late.{nl}I hope one of these three poisons work.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007760	We were going to go find a Wugushi in the city, but fortunately it seems that we don't need to do that.{nl}I think I will be able to make an antidote if we have the leaves from Woodluwa.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007761	I was worried that we may have to move to another city.{nl}If we have to look for a Wugushi there, then we can't guarantee our lives.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007762	I'll absorb the poison with this.{nl}I am going to keep looking over him so please care of Marko, he seems uneasy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007763	You won't understand how embarassed and painful I am.{nl}My brother almost died due to the posion and I received help from the Hunters that I kicked out...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007764	Good. You would have to persuade Guus at Laukyme Swamp.{nl}Please tell Marko that I've decided to go with Hunters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007765	It's is so fortunate that it turned out alright.{nl}Please meet Captain Mintz on your way to Laukyme Swamp and tell him that everything went alright.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007766	Senior monk Guus is leading the brothers at Laukyme Swamp.{nl}If Evoniphon did all of these, the Goddesses would also understand my rage.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007767	It's so nice seeing you.{nl}So how did the task at Viltis Forest go?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007768	Go first.{nl}I will follow you to Laukyme Swamp if he gets there alright.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007769	So that's it. We now have to persuade one of the monks and retrieve the monastery...{nl}After that, we would be able to contact with the abbot who would decide what to do with Evoniphon.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007770	I will gather the Hunters.{nl}Please continue to help Natasha at Laukyme Swamp.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007771	When you go up the Ershike Path, you will reach Laukyme Swamp.{nl}If you fail to persuade them, then we would have to retrieve the monastery ourselves.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007772	You've come a long way.{nl}So I heard a monk named Guus is taking the place of the abbot.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007773	Strange... a traveler in this place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007774	It's so shameful as a hunter...{nl}After finding the traces of Evoniphon, I was really delighted, but I found out that was a trap...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007775	I am sorry, but can you look for the grass that he is looking for?{nl}I can only move one of my arms and my neck.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007776	It's so fortunate that you came before the monsters.{nl}I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007777	Good. Good. {nl}We should first survive before feeling embarassed. Thanks!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007778	We have lots of things to prepare.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007779	You are not... one of those Hunters.{nl}Since I can't trust them, I have a request for you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007780	I want to make an ointment for the wounded brothers.{nl}Can you make beehives with the blessing from the Goddesses?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007781	It took so little time for monsters to sweep across the monastery.{nl}I think I was lucky enough to be alive with the blessing from the Goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007782	You've tried hard, but... we were making beeswax, but strangely, it doesn't becomme clear at all.{nl}What should we do about this...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007783	That's it. I am sorry, but can you help me with one more thing?{nl}If I only have the resin that is collected in the head of Woodluwa I think I will be able to resolve it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007784	I didn't expect I would meet someone other than those Hunters.{nl}I am sure the Goddesses haven't abandoned me yet.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007785	I wasn't able to do anything myself, but it is so fortunate that the Goddesses have sent you.{nl}I will make some medicine. Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007786	Stranger...{nl}If you don't have any task here, please go back.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007787	The monastery is locked with the barriers of the monks so it won't be possible without the persuasion from Guus.{nl}But, I... it's too difficult.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007788	Hunters... they just won't give up.{nl}I've heard Marko and Potos are with the Hunters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007789	But, you should be cautious.{nl}We just can't listen to one side.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007790	After persuading him, we can immediately start to retrieve the monastery.{nl}We can expect to expel Evoniphon then.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007791	Without Guus, we won't be able to recover the monastery.{nl}I hope you succeed in persuading him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007792	But, I think we can resume the talk after retrieving the monastery.{nl}Please show me the competence which I could rely on so I can cooperate with you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007793	Good.{nl}The Liverworts and Stonacons around here would be enough. Please also bring the proofs.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007794	You can give up if you feel that's too much for you.{nl}We were gonna finish it ourselves.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007795	You definitely possess the competence. We also have the same objective.{nl}There is no reason to insist anymore.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007796	The senior monk here is very picky.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007797	I will gather the monks in front of the entrance of the monastery, so tell the Hunters to gather as well.{nl}After they are here, we will unleash the seals to block any monsters from following us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007798	But, although we retrieved the monastery, don't expect us to expel Evoniphon.{nl}The abbot will decide everything after he comes out from the Prayer Room.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007799	Please understand that we could only do this.{nl}We've only listened to your story.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007800	What Guus said also makes sense.{nl}As they gather in front of the monastery, we should have some decisive evidence that would withdraw Evoniphon's declaration.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007801	I think we would have enough time.{nl}I am sorry, but please go back to Guus and ask him what happened when Evoniphon was coming.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007802	You can't prove that he was a cruel assassin.{nl}We can't release the ones that are being protected in the sanctuary by just guessing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007803	What they said about the traps and the monsters that conquered the monastery are also the same.{nl}It's only an one-sided story that this was done by Evoniphon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007804	We are the people who pray for the generosity of the Goddesses.{nl}So to withdraw the protection of Evoniphon, you should show them some decisive evidence.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007805	Hmm. I remember that clearly.{nl}One day, someone named Evoniphon knocked on the door of the monastery. With his wounded body...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007806	After bringing him inside, I began to cure him.{nl}He also requested to protect the sanctuary at our monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007807	That's right. Before he came on that day, one man who seemed to be affected by the poison also came.{nl}He was gravely ill, so he passed away before I could even ask him a question.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007808	His grave is in Fasadu Rest Area. With his keepsakes.{nl}Ah, Evoniphon also asked me whether there was someone who came before him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007809	The man affected by the poison... I am sure he ran away from Evoniphon.{nl}But why did he run away from Evoniphon...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007810	There weren't any other things besides that.{nl}Did this help you?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007811	It's not good for the deceased, but I think I should look for his keepsakes from his grave.{nl}I need to find out why Evoniphon was chasing after him. Please, you have to help me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007812	Did you find anything?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007813	This is the directory of Schaffenstar.{nl}There's a letter in the middle of it... This is the seal of Schaffenstar. Let's rip it off.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007814	This is the request letter for murder and the confirmation of the receipt. The receiver is Evoniphon...{nl}I think Evoniphon thought this letter would be at the monastery.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007815	I am sure that Evoniphon caused the mess of the monsters to look for this. It was easy for him to do this.{nl}This is decisive evidence. Let's show it to Guus.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007816	Murder request... this is decisive evidence.{nl}The abbot would think differently when he sees this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007817	All the other monks are ready and went in front of the monastery.{nl}Let's go. I will see you in front of the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007818	Everything is clear now.{nl}I will go to the entrance of the monastery first. Let's join there together.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007819	You have come?{nl}We are ready to enter the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007820	Everyone seems to be gathering in front of the monastery.{nl}Let's hurry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007821	I thought it was a manner not to touch it since it was his last keepsake.{nl}How would anyone have thought it would turn out like this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007822	Everyone knows that the Hunter Master and the Ranger Master are chasing after Evoniphon.{nl}But, the reason why no one could step forward is because they didn't have any decisive evidence.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007823	Now, it is different. This letter is the evidence.{nl}Since we have the seal of Schaffenstar, we don't have to worry about it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007824	This place is dangerous... I miss the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007825	I want to be safe until I go back to the monastery.{nl}But the monsters near here are very threatening.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007826	There will be lots of monsters if we move out a bit from the hills.{nl}I'll be counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007827	Now, I can relax until I go back to the monastery.{nl}Thank you so much. I hope the Goddesses bless you...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007828	We don't have enough water to drink here. It is strange since this place is full of water.{nl}After this place turned into a thorny forest, we can't drink it without purifying it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007829	If we have Asilado water plant, we can purify it with that.{nl}But, I am too scared of the monsters... Can you obtain some of them?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007830	We would last for a while even if there's no food, but not without drinkable water.{nl}I hope you would help us.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007831	Wow. You've collected a lot.{nl}Thank you so much. We will use these water plants well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007832	We need help due to the monsters!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007833	I didn't expect someone to come at this dangerous place...{nl}I am observing the movements of the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007834	After we are done, everyone would gather here. {nl}I am worried that they may lose their energies due to the monsters before retrieving the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007835	There are more dangerous monsters inside the monastery.{nl}We don't have a chance if we lose all our energies here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007836	Thank you.{nl}But, I am worried since there are still many monsters left.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007837	Are you trying to help me more?{nl}If that's so, it will be really appreciated...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007838	We've cleaned up many monsters. {nl}One more thing... I want you to do the last task.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007839	Thanks for your efforts.{nl}When the monks ask me, I will tell them to pray to the Goddesses to protect you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007840	{memo X}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007841	We've recovered the hall. Let's continue on without taking a rest.{nl}Mintz... please take the rear since the monsters may follow.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007842	It doesn't look easy from here.{nl}There are many monsters in the hallway so let's be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007843	We ended up like this while moving fast to save the abbot...{nl}We will move again after we get some rest so please go first.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007844	{memo X}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007845	{memo X}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007846	We barely saved the abbot.{nl}Thanks for your efforts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007847	{memo X}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007848	{memo X}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007849	Are you talking about the crystal sphere?{nl}I can't move it out at all so I hid it inside the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007850	It's so good to recover the monastery, but when are we going to finish cleaning it...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007851	It was a really important object so I put it in the box first.{nl}Inside the reception room. If you find it, please take it to Guus.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007852	I have to protect this place so I can't go with you.{nl}There aren't many boxes so you will find it easily.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007853	Yes. That's the crystal sphere.{nl}Please bring it to Guus.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007854	abbot
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007855	Thanks for resolving the crisis.{nl}I can feel the Goddesses are protecting you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007856	So you've come. Soon, the abbot would come out.{nl}Please wait a bit here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007857	Why is the monastery like this and why are you all gathered here?{nl}And you... you seem to have some business with me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007858	He is the abbot of the Tyla Monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007859	We barely managed to come this far so I am hoping for good results.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007860	So you are asking me to withdraw my declaration to protect Evoniphon.{nl}You came this far to do that...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007861	Okay. I will discuss with the abbot.{nl}Can you wait until then?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007862	I will wait for their decision here first.{nl}If their declaration doesn't get withdrawn, then I should think about what to do at then.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007863	So it seems that their discussion is over.{nl}Let's go there and listen to their conclusion.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007864	We haven't finished our discussion.{nl}Please wait with the Hunters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007865	After we've discussed with the senior monks...{nl}We've decided to withdraw our declaration to protect Evoniphon.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007866	From this point on, Evoniphon won't be protected by Tyla Monastery and we request Evoniphon to leave at once.{nl}Also, we are not going to be involved with others' decision to punish him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007867	I hope the Goddessess will be with you on your rest of journey.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007868	Besides from the expulsion, we can't forgive his actions that ruined the monastery.{nl}We should find him since he should be here somewhere.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007869	He made the monastery like this due to that letter. {nl}Please be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007870	He is so cunning..{nl}The Hunters are surrounding this place so he will get caught within a short period of time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007871	We would have had hard time without your help.{nl}Thank you so much for your efforts. I pray that the Goddesses be with you on your journey.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007872	If it wasn't for your help, the circumstances would have not been like this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007873	I've read it from the book before. {nl}Some smell has the power to pull the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007874	I should've noticed when Evoniphon brought that lump... I didn't expect that would be enlarged this big...{nl}We are eliminating them as we see them, but I want you to help us as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007875	We are luring the monsters with the smell so it won't be effective if you just destroy them.{nl}Please destroy the lumps using this liquid medicine.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007876	When I saw it, it was about the size of my palm so I don't understand how it got that big.{nl}This is all my fault...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007877	I don't know how long it would take to drive those monsters out...{nl}But now is the time to start.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007878	We were able to retrieve the monastery, but as you can see there are still full of monsters.{nl}Could you help us little more?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007879	Orange Kowaks inside the monastery are most problematic.{nl}They are the most violent and vicious monsters among the monsters that came into the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007880	They are still inside.{nl}Please eliminate the monsters including them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007881	The number of monsters won't increase from this point on.{nl}But, in order to eliminate them completely, we would need lots of time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007882	The Goddesses helped us to retrieve the monastery.{nl}Lots of other sacred places are still occupied by many monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007883	It's a mess. {nl}The monsters are sweeping across the monastery so the books are all scattered.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007884	When would we able to gather all these books again and divide them into different categories...{nl}If you pick up scriptures, please bring them to me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007885	You don't have to try hard.{nl}I can collect them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007886	Thanks.{nl}We should be able to gather all of them again right?
