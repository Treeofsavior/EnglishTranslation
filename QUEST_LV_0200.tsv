QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007149	But those damn monsters! They are attacking our colleagues.{nl}Please. Could you be with our colleagues to protect them for a while?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007150	My old friend, Galen is one of the victims.{nl}Please protect him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007151	Thank you so much.{nl}I hope the reinforcement comes soon so he could return to his family even if he is petrified.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007152	We didn't treat them badly, but they betrayed us.{nl}Dico Thieves stole the supplies from us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007153	{memo X}They must have taken them to Drasa worship ruins, but since I can't leave this place, I guess we all gonna die.{nl}I am sorry, but can you retrieve the supplies that were stolen by the thieves?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007154	A few decades ago, the thieves attacked the guard camp or stole the supplies secretly.{nl}They were punished for doing so, but I guess they forgot about it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007155	They lured us in front of them and stole the goods from behind.{nl}We should set something up, but our chiefs are fighting against the Knights of Kaliss. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007156	We have one more trouble.{nl}I mean Sabina, who is a Knight of Kaliss.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007157	They are insisting that they would not go back until they find the damaged artifacts.{nl}We can't get out from this place so I don't know what they want us to do...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007158	The city that was destroyed a few hundreds years ago has no assets or no people to protect.{nl}I rather feel like protecting a historical site. Even tomb thieves are here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007159	Now, I just hope Sabina stays calm.{nl}We don't want to be like them here because of the Stone Frosts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007160	It's not an easy thing to ditch the kingdom soldiers.{nl}I want to know the truth here. The truth which the soldiers really hate about.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007161	I need your help since you don't seem to belong to any side.{nl}Could you make rubber copies of the records that are remaining here?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007162	These are the records from the time when the Fortress of the Land collapsed.{nl}We could maybe know more about the Fortress of the Land from the headquarter of Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007163	But, the Fortress of the Land can't be entered because the kingdom soldiers are restricting the access.{nl}Even the Knights of Kaliss.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007164	Maybe... we could restore the time of the portal that was used when we retreated from the Fortress of the Land.{nl}It is dangerous from this point on so if you are going to quit, please tell me now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007165	What we are planning right now could lead us to the gallows.{nl}Please keep it secret.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007166	{memo X}When we were in the era of Premier Eminent, we were supported by the superior troops, lots of supplies and etc.{nl}But, 600 years have passed after Premier Eminent died.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007167	No matter how large the rebellion was, after experiencing Medzio Diena, our support waned. If anything, it's a question of whether we must remain here. For 600 years?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007168	I heard the Dico Thieves were well known thieves.{nl}I heard that they were separated on Medzio Diena... Anyways... what they are doing is like what bandits are doing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007169	I also know that there are thieves called Amanda Thieves. They were quiet.{nl}I want to know if they really exist or not since I never saw them before.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007170	Both of them are criminals that we should catch when we receive more reinforcements.{nl}Especially, Dico Thieves.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007171	We are observing what the researchers of the Knights of Kaliss are doing, and while pretending to be their guards.{nl}Sabina was one of them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007172	They disappear and appear again using the artifacts that are remaining in the city so I have troubles chasing after them.{nl}But, were Chronomancers the people who investigate the portals?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007173	I really appreciate for your kindness, but it's not going to be easy. If it was easy, we would've found them already.{nl}I don't know why, but the monsters ate the artifacts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007174	$This place is the cursed city of the traitor, Ruklys.{nl}It has been cursed with Stone Frost since the end of the rebellion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007175	$We will permit your entry since the Knights of Kaliss requested us to do so,{nl}but please remain at places where we can keep an eye out for you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007176	$I don't know how great you were in the past,{nl}but you have to follow the rules of the kingdom here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007177	Benas asked us to secure the route that connects to the Fortress of the Land.{nl}Ah, he is the ruler of the kingdoms soldiers in this region.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007178	If you could defeat the monsters in the ruins, that will be the way to contribute to the goddesses and the kingdom.{nl}Of course, I promise you some rewards in return.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007179	It will not be bad to show us a good impression.{nl}Because this land is ruled by the kingdom soldiers.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007180	It wasn't done by the thieves. We are moving the objects to the places where they could find more values.{nl}It will be way better than disappearing from here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007181	Not bad.{nl}I guess the rumors don't always get exaggerated.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007182	We are activating the detectors here because of irregular Stone Frosts that are blowing,{nl}but, there are no soldiers who could check that due to a recent battle.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007183	So if you could do that for us,{nl}that will be the way to be loyal to the kingdom and continue the determination.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007184	There are monsters who try to go after the soldiers who maintain the device.{nl}Be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007185	The Stone Frosts are to be blown from the two places.{nl}I heard you are a quite famous Revelator. Aren't you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007186	From some time ago, more soldiers are being attacked by Sparnashorn near the detectors.{nl}If you are the one from the rumor, you would be able to face against that monster.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007187	Those soldiers are the ones who survived from the Stone Frosts and Sparnashorn.{nl}They can't fight against Sparnashorn since they are blind due to fear. They also have no chance of defeating Sparnashorn.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007188	The Stone Frosts are delayed a bit.{nl}Whatever we do, there is no way to block the punishments that were brought by Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007189	Now the only thing that is remaining is Sparnashorn... Defeat it quickly and get outta there.{nl}Even a great Revelator like you can not withstand the Stone Frosts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007190	Retreating is also a tactic, but we can't always do it.{nl}We should finish it when we have an volunteer who is loyal and competent like you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007191	Hearing that it was defeated is the most hopeful story I've heard in years. {nl}Now I better let the troops rest first and tell them the good news.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007192	Although I don't know you, I am glad to see you.{nl}It's good to be acquainted with someone here. Everyone should help each other out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007193	For example, help cleaning the monsters at our workplace.{nl}The gathering place. What do you think? Can you help us?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007194	The kind of work I do is business secret so I can't tell you what it is.. {nl}No one owns these things anyway. Finders keep them if them if they need them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007195	That fast? Have you not missed any of the monsters?{nl}Ahah. Those coward kingdom soldiers won't get near here so don't worry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007196	You want to know how I got here? {nl}It's all because I have connections. There are some kingdom soldiers who buy claws of the monsters to raise their work records.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007197	But actually, I don't want to be around those monsters. Especially here.{nl}If you could get me those claws, we will become really good friends.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007198	I think you are misunderstanding something.{nl}We are archaeologists, not thieves.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007199	Thank you so much friend.{nl}Though this seems quite polished.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007200	I will tell you something. You better not think about getting something here.{nl}Aside from us, there is the outrageous Dico Thieves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007201	I don't want to see them more than those kingdom soldiers.{nl}The goods they brought here from outside are piled up at the entrance route of the outer wall... {nl}What would occur if they all disappear?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007202	I took a sneak peek, but it seems they haven't returned yet.{nl}Move fast.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007203	Seems like Dico Thieves are planning to do their business bigger than I thought. {nl}That's an enormous amount. Do you think they also have connections with the kingdom army?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007204	The terrible scene you can see in this city are the results of the rebellion that was carried out by Ruklys and the citizens 600 years ago.{nl}The Stone Frosts that started to blow after suppressing the rebellion turn everything into stones.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007205	The kingdom would've been destroyed already if Premier Eminent wasn't present.{nl}If he was still alive... We may have got over these hard times sooner.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007206	That's the scary wind that turns everything into stones.{nl}After Medzio Diena, the occurrence of the wind varied irregularly.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007207	Once you encounter the curse of the Stone Frosts, you can't restore it.{nl}The sin of the traitor, Ruklys is that heavy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007208	The Knights of Kaliss is trying to find a remedy...{nl}The curse continued for 600 years. I don't think there's a remedy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007209	Sparnashorn appears with the wind of Stone Frosts.{nl}To avoid the exhausted soldiers not get involved with it, we should avoid them fighting against Sparnashorn.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007210	If we could eliminate the weak Stone Frosts with this absorbing scroll at the great square, we may delay the time a bit.{nl}We would be able to lure Sparnashorn to the old market when the next Stone Frosts blow.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007211	I've a friend who's supposed to come here but he's nowhere to be found.{nl}I think something happened.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007212	He is hiding among the guards near the great square.{nl}This water bottle has a code on it. If you give it to the guards, he'll know and talk to you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007213	He is hiding among the guards.{nl}This water bottle has a code on it. If you give it to the guards, he'll know and talk to you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007214	Hush! Lower your voice. It will be the end of both of us if we get caught.{nl}Did that stupid Juvertas send you here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007215	I told him many times that I'd go back if I'm done with my work here.{nl}There is a big problem here actually.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007216	Our family can't come into the city from outside.{nl}We can't bring in my family without the troops knowing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007217	I'm going to make big fuss at the great square. I'm going to call in Saltistter that are roaming around the area. {nl}In order to do this, you need to gather scented stone powder from the monsters. Can you do it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007218	Our families should have passed this place earlier than the kingdom army. {nl}But Retia hurried things when the Stone Frosts swept by some time ago so we weren't able to.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007219	If you pour this here, you will soon see the Saltistter show up its huge body itself.{nl}But that is not our plan.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007220	We should not make this place a battlefield. Then our families can't pass through.{nl}Let's rub this powder onto the Rambears that appear at the great square.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007221	Then Saltistter will attack Rambears. {nl}Retia will not just stand and watch her area be invaded like that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007222	Our families come from various areas.{nl}I was also once a junior officer with dreams to become a strategist.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007223	Of course, it was before the area I was assigned to completely disappeared from the map on Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007224	Did you use everything?{nl}Then now it's time to get busy!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007225	Go to Retia and tell her that Saltistter is coming here.{nl}She won't believe it but I can already feel the Saltistter running at us. {nl}Hurry!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007226	You just have to tell her that Saltistter is coming.{nl}There is no reason for her to suspect us.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007227	Our families passed through this place without any problems.{nl}Since you are still being trusted by our kingdom soldiers, you will not be discovered.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007228	This city... you will find many interesting truths if you continue your journey in this area.{nl}And you may also meet our families.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007229	I don't want to be here either.{nl}I would not be here if I didn't receive the orders to support the Knights of Kaliss...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007230	Kostas has not come back for days so I can't leave this place.{nl}Also the monsters are running wild so I can't just stay still.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007231	$We have to be here until Kostas comes back.{nl}There are lot of things to do, so I hope he comes back soon.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007232	The officers don't like the Knights of Kaliss. {nl}As for lower rank guards like me, the Knights of Kaliss give us supplies and supports so there's no reason for us to hate them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007233	If we can find the Symbol of Silt, then we would be able to enter the area without any problems.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007234	I can't hear anything from Kostas.{nl}Ah... I don't know how I should report.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007235	$The kingdom soldiers, the Knights of Kaliss, and we graverobbers are forming an excellent balance.{nl}That's why people can at least walk around.. Before that, this place was not a place to stay.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007236	Much of the city remained in its original form 600 years after the misfortune due to Stone Frosts.{nl}One of my missions here is to clear the records of rebels remaining here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007237	I can't leave my post since Kostas is not here.{nl}You can find many records if you look around the trade area so I want you to take care of them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007238	Don't mind what's written on the records. {nl}It's all nonsense.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007239	I have to escort, clean up, and guard. I wonder how they are expecting me to do everything alone. {nl}It's a good thing you came to help.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007240	It is an old story,{nl}but many kingdom soldiers came to this place to do a preliminary check to support for the research on the Knights of Kaliss.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007241	But, unlike their expectations, the Stone Frosts were waiting for them.{nl}They died there... I want to get their keepsakes, but it's hard...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007242	The authorities do not take it well that tens of soldiers were sacrificed for support activities. {nl}That's why the kingdom army and the Knights of Kaliss have become distant.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007243	Good thing I was off duty that day.. I don't even want to think about it.{nl}I will deliver this to the families of the deceased.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007244	Gofden...{nl}The Silt Certificate... Ah sorry I talked alone in front of you.{nl}When you are carrying this, you will not receive the curse of the Stone Frosts. Don't you think it's amazing?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007245	People say you go around to save the world according to the will of goddess?{nl}Then you could save also save this city!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007246	Our employer does not support us any other funds besides the research funds to revive the city.{nl}That's why the wizards like me, who want to come up with some results are researching while avoiding the eyes of the kingdom soldiers and the Knights of Kaliss.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007247	This will be enough.{nl}Good. Let's combine this with the Symbol of Silt.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007248	We've succeeded the combination... but I can't predict how effective this would be.{nl}I will give you the Symbol of Silt so try using it on the monsters in this area.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007249	If it's effective, then something would react to it.{nl}Maybe since the effects for the Stone Frosts disappeared, it could take little faster. Anyways, I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007250	Since I handed over the Symbol of Silt to you, I am gonna be dead when the Stone Frosts blow here.{nl}Please finish the task as quickly as possible.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007251	So it was effective right?{nl}Then now, I will amplify it!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007252	Ah... I almost forgot.{nl}Even if I amplify the Symbol of Silt with the reacting stone, the power doesn't last eternally.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007253	{memo X}Good, good... I will activate it only when the Stone Frosts blow.{nl}I should obtain the detector somewhere.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007254	{memo X}If you could bring me the detector, I will do the rest.{nl}You've contributed a lot in this experiment so I will give you the effects of the Symbol of Silt.{nl}Although it would not last long...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007255	There were experiments in the past.{nl}At Roxona Reconstruction Agency, there was a separate laboratory to research on the curse of the Stone Frosts.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007256	But then demons rushed in...{nl}Most of them were killed by the demons or became petrified on the experimental devices.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007257	This Symbol of Silt... it reminds me of many things.{nl}It was too bad since the results of the experiments were appearing at that time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007258	They told me to protect the objects that are gathered at Gerove Workshop Site.{nl}Do you think this makes sense? Why don't they ask the monsters to protect?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007259	Ah! We should just do it like that.{nl}Hey, could you help me a bit?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007260	It's a good thing the cowardly Dico Thieves did not reach here yet.{nl}Things are limited but people are coming in flocks to take them away..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007261	If it's cleared up that much, then looks like I can start already.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007262	There are some boxes that our thieves left at Gerove Workshop.{nl}When you rub Bellas grass onto them, the monsters would rush in.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007263	But, you gotta be careful.{nl}The monsters would not treat you preciously so run away after attacking them a little.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007264	I think I can leave this place for a while because of you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007265	You haven't seen Dico Thieves right?{nl}In fact, I haven't seen them as well, but Amanda told you to be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007266	Please take care of the monsters in the military district while I prepare the test. {nl}We should not be caught or interfered.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007267	It's relatively safe on top of the fortress.{nl}There are monsters and thieves swarming if you leave this place.{nl}Of course, the kingdom soldiers as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007268	$I don't like it, having to guard here with the Knights of Kaliss around.{nl}You will never understand what it feels like to guard here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007269	Until now, I am sure that you've only seen the artifacts that stopped their time.{nl}But, it will be different from this point on since I came here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007270	I will proceed the test from up here.{nl}Please go to the portal and activate it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007271	Don't worry too much.{nl}Everything is just your memories at then so they won't do any harms to you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007272	I am sorry. Aren't you hurt somewhere?{nl}I didn't know it would go over my expectations.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007273	What was that... demons? Are they really demons?{nl}I have no way of knowing. I guess I will have to tune up the portal that leads to the Fortress of the Land.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007274	It is little dangerous... but, I want to suggest a deal to you.{nl}We are actually cooperating with Amanda thieves. Yes. I know it's insane.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007275	To obtain what you want, you should take this risk.{nl}Just help Amanda thieves to enter into the city.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007276	{memo X}Would dead people come back if the curse is cured in this city?{nl}No, but the times after now are more important.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007277	We feel like we are risking our lives every seconds.{nl}But we continuously watch over so that nothing will go wrong.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007278	We're different from those Dico Thieves.{nl}If you help well this time, I will surely pay you back someday.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007279	The guards were asking what the fuss was all about so I told them about you. {nl}Everything should be alright.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007280	If you watch over the city from here, it feels like the time has stopped.{nl}However, many incidents are occurring everyday.{nl}{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007283	They will reduce their boundaries as they are get attacked.{nl}Or bring a huge army in...but, they won't be able to do that with the current state of the kingdom.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007284	Now, please lure the guards at the watermill ruins.{nl}Just tell them the monsters are going crazy at Estuary Bank Three Ways.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007285	Steponas will pass by secretly.{nl}Of course, you will receive their respects.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007286	Rofdel will be watching from the watchtower but on a foggy day like this, it's useless.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007287	Steponas passed through safely.{nl}He was looking for you. Go and help him.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007288	The guards won't mention our names to Rofdel.{nl}What they have been taking until now was all against the military law.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007289	Have you seen the records that are remaining in this city? Didn't they feel somewhat strange...{nl}The Knights of Kaliss are collecting the records which the kingdom soldiers have not yet eliminated.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007290	I have a request. Please gather the propagandas which the kingdom soldiers circulated.{nl}When we compare those with the records that we've gathered, we will find something lacking.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007291	As the defeat of Ruklys became more and more concrete, the kingdom soldiers circulated the propagandas more.{nl}There must be some propagandas left in the Stone Frosts as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007292	They made such embarrassing stories sound like a heroic epic to the ignorant people. {nl}600 years have passed, but they are still embarrassing.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007293	You're the one who made me an opportunity.{nl}But, what the hell. I never heard there were so many guards here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007294	I need your help. I need a more powerful bomb.{nl}The frost core that I promised with the Knights of Kaliss is inside the body of Stone Froster.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007295	Just do as I told you. {nl}If it's not the bomb, we can't pull out the frost core.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007296	The purity level is not satisfactory.{nl}It could take some time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007297	Since we don't have the fuse, it was made to explode when it gets hit.{nl}I will give you this so I want you to test it on the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007298	If we can't get this done, we can't even start with the next step.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007299	It won't explode right away and explosion is not steady.{nl}What to do..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007300	It should stick to the monster in order to secure the time to explode with a bam.{nl}Can you get the kneaded mucus of the monsters in Viskas?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007301	I'll say it again but this is the only way to keep you safe.{nl}Hmm? Of course you should throw it. I am busy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007302	I think you spilled some on your way. {nl}Too bad for your new shoes.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007303	You will find a stiff Stone Froster in the residential area. {nl}Throw this to Stone Froster to wake it up. Don't forget to move far after throwing it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007304	When his armor opens up, we should aim for the space.{nl}Don't forget about the frost core.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007305	So this is the frost core that bothered many people.. {nl}The soldiers who helped you will tell the guy watching from the watchtower about your heroic stories so they won't suspect you. Dont' worry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007306	I was worried a lot because it seems there's a big fuss over there.{nl}But, I also had some productive results. Everything will be alright soon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007307	If you are going to be near here, please come to me. {nl}I could cast a spell on you to protect you from the Stone Frosts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007308	Good. Let's go to the old market. {nl}When you touch on the detector, Sparnashorn will start to attack you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007309	Those Dico Thieves are so smart.{nl}They buy cheap antiques from outside and bury them where the Stone Frosts blow.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007310	Then they will turn into stones.{nl}The aristocrats in the big cities get deceived by them and they buy them at expensive prices.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007311	There are stones that constantly float down the Vadova port.{nl}It is the record of the rebellion from 600 years ago.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007312	The records contain the contents that discourage the soldiers so the officers destroyed them from time to time.{nl}But, since we don't have enough workforce, I want you to take care of them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007313	I don't understand how these heavy stuffs float down here and make us dizzy.{nl}I will probably use them when we repair the watchtower.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007314	Whenever the Stone Frosts blow, the number of soldiers decreases, but the kingdom doesn't possess additional soldiers to support.{nl}That's why we ask the graverobbers or the refugees to join the military.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007315	Only thing I can do is to attach these leaflets around here.{nl}I hope you could help me by thinking that you are supporting the kingdom.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007316	I'm sure people taking the leaflets but the number of applicants have decreased recently. {nl}Is it because the graverobbers started checking inside. Isn't it suspicious?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007317	When a person like Premier Eminent appears again, I'm sure that the kingdom will flourish quickly.{nl}I will pray to the goddesses that you could be an important person like him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007318	The number of monsters in Kovos battlefield is increasing. {nl}We don't even know what is leading them here.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007321	I heard you have lots of battle experiences.{nl}I even want to suggest you to join the Knights of Kaliss.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007322	I believe that there is no curse in this world that can't be cured.{nl}With all my faith, I will discover the cure.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007323	You're as great as the rumors say. {nl}The Knights of Kaliss need heroes like you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007324	This is an interesting place. {nl}This city is filled with things to experiment.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007325	Stone debris and dust blow a lot in this area so many soldiers and knights cough severly. {nl}The knightage headquarters send us refreshing candies mixed with medicinal herbs.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007327	I would like to give you some if we have extras. {nl}Even the graverobbers are preying on the candies.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007328	I won't blame you if you eat one secretly. {nl}But you don't seem to be that kind of a person.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007329	Soldiers patrolling this area were swept by stone frost while passing by Stalactite square some time ago.{nl}We are only affiliated to kingdom army but we're mostly residents of Kalis province.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007330	I want to help my folks from back home, but there is no way to get them out of the curse. {nl}We can only get their last will and keepsakes for their families. {nl}Won't you show your kindness for them before they lose their conciousness?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007331	{memo X}I understand their loyalty for the kingdom, but when I see them make people do impossible things that lead to deaths...{nl}I don't know who is the monster anymore.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007332	In order to restore the city, the Knights of Kaliss  hired many experts.{nl}But they just recruit people without any support afterwards.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007333	In order to continue the research, I seriously need your help.{nl}If we could make the miraculous medicine that would drag out the controlled spirit, we may able to find out the source of the curse.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007334	Besides the knowledge of the spells I possess, I am trying to approach it with various methods.{nl}I will lift this curse for sure.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007335	That's enough ingredients to make elixir of freedom. {nl}Now, let's start.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007336	I will give you this freedom elixir. Use it on the petrified victims at Vienti Fortress.{nl}Their souls trapped in the body might tell you something about what they last witnessed.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007337	The angry souls might attack you.{nl}Please be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007338	There was nothing to find out about other than the fact that they were all in panic and feat when dying. {nl}I guess I better look for even older victims.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007339	{memo X}We can't even find the traces of the bodies of the victims who were sacrificed on the day of Ruklys' rebellion due to Stone Frosts.{nl}But, that angry souls are deeply permeated into the city.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007340	{memo X}Please light the fire at the incense burner that I set at Vienti Fortress with the Knightage.{nl}The angry souls will tell you the story of that day.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007341	{memo X}Please do not stimulate the angry souls.{nl}Since they are unstable, I don't know how they would react.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007342	Pains, anger... betrayer and fear...{nl}I can still feel the feelings from that day.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007343	But, they are not towards humans.{nl}It's as if something deep and dark... I am going to go back to the knightage and find out more about it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007344	Even trees or paper turn into stones besides living creatures...{nl}I am very interested in these non-senses. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007345	{memo X}If you could help me...{nl}Maybe we could save them even if they are cursed with the petrification. Although they may lose their arms.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007346	Even if it works on just one or two from ten of them, that would be great.{nl}I trust on my knowledge and skills.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007347	You weren't able to save any of them? {nl}I guess this is not a good way. I will take back what is left.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007348	I think we should use different drugs and test as much as we can. {nl}But then we will need a lot of samples.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007349	Can you defeat the monsters in Nevekia Fortress and get me petrified samples?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007350	This should be enough for about five tests. Good work.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007351	To tell you one more time, the curse of the petrification is a chemical reaction so I don't think you would be able to restore it.{nl}If you could come to me fast, then you will save your life even if you lose one of your legs.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007352	May those victims rest in peace.{nl}However, like the river that attracts those who are thirsty, this place is astounding for me and my thirst for knowledge.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007353	There's a dumb monster that is ruining the beautiful place on the top of Nebekia Fortress.{nl}I want you to take care of him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007354	It if has a brain, how can it go around ruining this? {nl}Oh well, maybe that's why it's a monster.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007355	{memo X}Did you defeat it? Great job!{nl}Now I don't have to fear this place being torn down until another monster shows up.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007356	The Stone Frosts just swept by so we should get to work quickly.{nl}We can see when and where the Stone Frosts start by checking whether the soldiers are retreating or not.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007357	And the quickest way to receive the information is to become a kingdom soldier.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007358	I am not sure since I am a low ranking soldier.{nl}This place originally belongs to Kaliss.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007359	This place belonged to the kingdom, but due to rebellions, 600 years have passed.{nl}Everyone thinks that the Knights of Kaliss will make a movement again soon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007360	But, even in this situation, there aren't any conflicts...{nl}The objective of the people who were dispatched here is on the research like Kostas so how would a low rank soldier like me know anything.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007361	According to what senior officers say, they are not officially belonged to the army, but they are rather somewhat more like mercenaries.{nl}I am not sure, but they asked me about many things on the Stone Frosts.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007362	Many people from the Knights of Kaliss actually came here to continue on their research besides Kostas.{nl}What would they want from the city of rebel forces... Isn't it strange?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007363	I don't know well since I am a low ranked soldier, but it seems that they don't like each other.{nl}I understand since they are trying to make a move after managing it for 600 years. Who would like it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007364	But, the Knights of Kaliss are saying that it's their fair right and they also said they are going to concentrate on the research so we can't say anything.{nl}What I've heard was to guard them and report their whereabouts... but, then they disappeared again.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007365	I've obtained it by paying a large sum to the kingdom soldiers so just take a look at it without touching it.{nl}Due to the petrified places, this place turned into a land which no living creatures could live for hundreds of years.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007366	But the lives are great. {nl}I predict that the small number of monsters that used to live here became resistant by being exposed to weak Stone Frosts.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007367	The crystals that grow inside the special monsters could unleash the power that could face against strong Stone Frosts.{nl}However, the problem is that they get discovered only one in several hundreds or even thousands... That's a pity.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007368	Thanks.{nl}We would be able to lift the curse of the petrification if we could amplify this ethereal power.{nl}Please first get me the reacting stones from the monsters at Palaikai Intersections. I am counting on you!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007369	Thanks.{nl}The petrification detectors that are left by the kingdom soldiers are scattered across Palaikai Intersections.{nl}Among them, please get me the ones that only react to the symbol of schilt.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007370	Ever since I came here, I feel like someone is keep looking at me.{nl}Anyways, see you again after the work is done.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007371	When it gets more apparent in the future, then there would an opportunity to show it to you.{nl}We need to collect more documents.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007372	For now, all I can tell you is that some different objective is involved with the rebellion of Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007373	The kingdom soldiers forbid anyone in this city from probing into Ruklys.{nl}Anyone who still does that could be treated as a traitor so they educate the soldiers firmly.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007374	But as they hide more and more, more people will be curious about Ruklys.{nl}The gallows could be near, but how could a scholar just do nothing?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007375	You are so brave.{nl}According to the records, there are 10 portals in total. Among them, four of them are near here.{nl}Could you find out if they are still activating?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007376	Please get me the hardened gunpowder from the monsters near the watermill ruins.{nl}Let's make special explosives using that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007377	I am going to bring in the thieves in through the central city area. {nl}While you are doing so, if you get encountered by a monster, you will soon get caught by the guards.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007378	That's why I want you to act first at the Estuary Bank Three Way.{nl}Unlike Dico Thieves, they pay back to the people they owed to so they will help your journey for sure.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007379	I don't know if you know the relationship between the soldiers and the Knights of Kaliss, but{nl}anyways, the soldiers are looking for something that they can never have.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007380	That's why they need the graverobbers. {nl}Of course, it is risky to cooperate with the thieves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007381	Even so, it is very valuable.{nl}And for the future, the relationship with the thieves will be useful.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007382	Please use the Berserk powder on the monsters at the Estuary Bank Three Way.{nl}The monsters won't stand at all and go crazy. It will make a quite mess.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007383	The information should sometimes be leaked, hid or modified in order to have some values.{nl}We could also make connections with different people by doing so.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007384	People say history is the record of the winners. I think so too.{nl}Have you seen the tombstones that are still remaining on the ruins near Fedimian?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007385	If what the soldiers are spreading is true, then there are many doubts on the records that are remaining here.{nl}And the behaviors of the soldiers that are trying to destroy them are also strange.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007386	Throw this against the monsters.{nl}If you are lucky enough, it will explode with a bang!, but if that's not it, you will make them angry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007387	Please collect the dark crystals from the monsters at Vienti Fortress.{nl}I will try to make an elixir that would pull out the controlled spirit.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007388	Thanks. First, would you use this melting solution to the monsters that are struggling due to the Stone Frosts?{nl}I mean Nebekia Fortress. If it's useful, you would be able to use it on the humans as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007389	I personally think the curse of the petrification is a chemical reaction.{nl}Which means you can't restore the things that are once petrified before.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007390	Even if, Bokor over there tries his best, he won't be able to restore it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007391	But, if the petrification is in progress,{nl}Then I think we may able to save the rest even if we lost the parts that have already become petrified.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007392	Almost all curses disappear when the casters die.{nl}I think the curse of the petrification is the same as the case in the way of the pilgrim.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007393	But the curse descended for 600 years.{nl}This means the caster of the curse also has lived for 600 years.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007394	But, if we could find out the true identity of the caster, we may push it with stronger power.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007395	$Kostas doesn't seem to be scared.{nl}Yet I am scared even though I've worked here for a long time. I don't have a clue where he went...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007396	$I feel sorry for Gofden who should be waiting for me, but I can't go.{nl}I must continue my research.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007399	I am sure there's a way to lift the curse completely.{nl}Although, it seems that Saliamonas has given up.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007400	I am sure there are hidden facts.{nl}Although I don't know what they are.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007401	This city would feel like lost families to the people of Kaliss.{nl}I am sure there's a way to restore the city.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007402	A few of them are mercenaries, but they are also the people of Kaliss.{nl}The way they look at this city will be the same.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007403	$The graverobbers are going all out here.{nl}We have to wait for extra support from headquarters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007404	I don't give false hopes to other people.{nl}I just want to find more realistic method.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007405	Were you deceived all this time?{nl}If we rub Bellas leaves on the boxes, monsters protect them as if they are something precious.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007406	Good. Please get me Bellas leaves at the commerce district.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007407	$My heart aches to see my colleagues that are just left out there against the elements after succumbing to the Stone Frost...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007408	I don't like the kingdom soldiers.{nl}They look at us like traitors for what happened 600 years ago.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007409	Now is the time to retrieve our land.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007410	We can't clearly see it on the days like today when the stone debris are blowing a lot.{nl}But, when it rains, you can clearly see Ruklys Street.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007411	Disciple Raius
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007412	We would be able to find the inheritance of the master if we try little more...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007413	This time, Hones will not stand without handing out the documents.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007414	While I was coming here, I saw the leaflets that encourage people to join the military.{nl}Rip them off all. They are good for sneezing.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007415	Since I don't know what the master has in his mind before he passed away, I am worried.{nl}No one would understand my mind.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007714	Look at this. This is the silk that was used in this trap.. I believe I've seen it before.{nl}If someone got his hands on the supplies of the monastery, we can think of only one person.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007715	Good.{nl}After retrieving the monastery, I will tell the abbot about this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007716	The captain sent you here?{nl}It's about time that reliable support came to me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007717	You will have to persuade the other brothers besides me.{nl}There is a place nearby called Viltis Forest. Senior Monk Marko can be found there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007718	Something big happened at the monastery.{nl}Would you be able to help us?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007719	I think I've lost my precious scripture while I was running away.{nl}But, I also have to take care of our brothers.. Can you look for them? I don't care if you only find the pages.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007720	If you can't find them, then we would have to accept it.{nl}People's lives are more important than the pages of the scripture.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007721	So they are ripped off..{nl}I guess we have no other choice. Please, let's first concentrate on curing my brothers.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007722	It's the worst case scenario.{nl}The forest is covered with thorns and there are traps everywhere.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007723	And my brothers are suffering because of the poison.{nl}If the threat of the monsters lowers down, I would be relaxed enough to finish the cure.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007724	Who made all these traps?{nl}I don't feel very well seeing my brothers suffer.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007725	Thank you so much.{nl}I will now pray for our brothers for a full recovery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007726	Since I quickly ran away from the monastery, I wasn't able to bring many things with me.{nl}I should somehow feed some nutritious food to our brothers who are suffering from the poison..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007727	Thank you so much.{nl}There is a mushroom called Tempas. It grows really fast.{nl}Please get me some of those from Juklas Sunny Place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007728	You will find it when you walk diligently.{nl}They are usually hidden in the ground.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007729	Thanks.{nl}I will pray to the goddesses that they will be okay after eating this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007730	Since I am not feeling well right now, I do want to prepare in advance.{nl}If you are going to hunt for monsters nearby, could you please listen to my request?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007731	Please collect the stone legs of the Rocktors.{nl}I can use those for my arrowheads.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007732	The stone legs of Roctors near this are usable.{nl}Other things are somewhat soft.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007733	This many.. Thank you so much.{nl}It will be good if we return to the place where the captain is, but we should first finish our mission.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007734	I think the monsters found out that I have suffered from the poison.{nl}They are slowly narrowing the gap. This could be dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007735	Let's use Jareth.{nl}Even if you stand in front, they may rush in when you leave.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007736	Please hunt for the monsters with Jareth.{nl}After they engage in combat, the monsters will be scared if Jareth unleashes its smell.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007737	Jareth is old, but very brave.{nl}Sometimes he has the tendency to attack first because of his bravery..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007738	Did Jareth do well?{nl}Now we can worry less about the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007739	We should retrieve the monastery.{nl}If we don't move fast, the abbot will be in danger.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007740	The abbot here is called Marko and he leads the monastery here.{nl}But, he is too stubborn. He is too difficult.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007741	I will support here with all I could so I hope you pass my position.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007742	I should've persuaded him slowly, but I think we were in a rush.{nl}But, it was that important...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007743	You are a different person. Even so, no is no.{nl}They are very rude. They know the circumstances well, and Evoniphon...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007744	And the abbot is locked in the monastery.{nl}Unless we retrieve the monastery, do not mention about the deportation.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007745	If retrieving monastery is more important, that's good.{nl}If they approve, we will support with everything we can.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007746	You should first help those monks.{nl}They should have more than one person in trouble. You should do favors for them first.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007747	Hunters will step up first. They should have done that in the first place.{nl}Then, I have something to request to you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007748	We were preparing to retrieve the monastery ourselves.{nl}Please let our brothers down there know that Hunters are helping.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007749	I shall wait for Boros. I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007750	Do not think bad about us.{nl}We should first retrieve the monastery, but they are only talking about Evoniphon so we don't feel comfortable.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007751	We have a problem. {nl}One of the monks have been suffering to the poison of Evoniphon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007752	He is breathing, but he is becoming stiff.{nl}What should we do about this...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007753	This place is dangerous.{nl}Be cautious at all times.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007754	We've passed the dangerous situation with an emergency procedure, but...{nl}If we don't detoxify it completely, there will be more crises.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007755	But, I saw this poison for the first time.{nl}While I am taking care of him, please get me the other poison so I could compare.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007756	What we should obtain is the poison from thorns of Chafferors
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007757	The poison must have been made using stuff that can be found around this area. {nl}Please hurry before it's too late.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007758	It is so fortunate that we discovered it before it's too late.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007759	You are not too late.{nl}I hope one of these three poisons work.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007760	We were going to go find a Wugushi in the city, but fortunately it seems that we don't need to do that.{nl}I think I will be able to make an antidote if we have the leaves from Woodluwa.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007761	I was worried that we may have to move to another city.{nl}If we have to look for a Wugushi there, then we can't guarantee our lives.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007762	I'll absorb the poison with this.{nl}I am going to keep looking over him so please care of Marko, he seems uneasy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007763	You won't understand how embarassed and painful I am.{nl}My brother almost died due to the posion and I received help from the Hunters that I kicked out...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007764	Good. You would have to persuade Guus at Laukyme Swamp.{nl}Please tell Marko that I've decided to go with Hunters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007765	It's is so fortunate that it turned out alright.{nl}Please meet Captain Mintz on your way to Laukyme Swamp and tell him that everything went alright.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007766	Senior monk Guus is leading the brothers at Laukyme Swamp.{nl}If Evoniphon did all of these, the goddesses would also understand my rage.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007767	It's so nice seeing you.{nl}So how did the task at Viltis Forest go?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007768	Go first.{nl}I will follow you to Laukyme Swamp if he gets there alright.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007769	So that's it. We now have to persuade one of the monks and retrieve the monastery...{nl}After that, we would be able to contact with the abbot who would decide what to do with Evoniphon.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007770	I will gather the Hunters.{nl}Please continue to help Natasha at Laukyme Swamp.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007771	When you go up the Ershike Path, you will reach Laukyme Swamp.{nl}If you fail to persuade them, then we would have to retrieve the monastery ourselves.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007772	You've come a long way.{nl}So I heard a monk named Guus is taking the place of the abbot.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007773	Strange... a traveler in this place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007774	It's so shameful as a hunter...{nl}After finding the traces of Evoniphon, I was really delighted, but I found out that was a trap...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007775	I am sorry, but can you look for the grass that he is looking for?{nl}I can only move one of my arms and my neck.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007776	It's so fortunate that you came before the monsters.{nl}I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007777	Good. Good. {nl}We should first survive before feeling embarassed. Thanks!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007778	We have lots of things to prepare.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007779	You are not... one of those Hunters.{nl}Since I can't trust them, I have a request for you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007780	I want to make an ointment for the wounded brothers.{nl}Can you make beehives with the blessing from the goddesses?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007781	It took so little time for monsters to sweep across the monastery.{nl}I think I was lucky enough to be alive with the blessing from the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007782	You've tried hard, but... we were making beeswax, but strangely, it doesn't becomme clear at all.{nl}What should we do about this...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007783	That's it. I am sorry, but can you help me with one more thing?{nl}If I only have the resin that is collected in the head of Woodluwa I think I will be able to resolve it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007784	I didn't expect I would meet someone other than those Hunters.{nl}I am sure the goddesses haven't abandoned me yet.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007785	I wasn't able to do anything myself, but it is so fortunate that the goddesses have sent you.{nl}I will make some medicine. Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007786	Stranger...{nl}If you don't have any task here, please go back.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007787	The monastery is locked with the barriers of the monks so it won't be possible without the persuasion from Guus.{nl}But, I... it's too difficult.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007788	Hunters... they just won't give up.{nl}I've heard Marko and Potos are with the Hunters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007789	But, you should be cautious.{nl}We just can't listen to one side.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007790	After persuading him, we can immediately start to retrieve the monastery.{nl}We can expect to expel Evoniphon then.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007791	Without Guus, we won't be able to recover the monastery.{nl}I hope you succeed in persuading him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007792	But, I think we can resume the talk after retrieving the monastery.{nl}Please show me the competence which I could rely on so I can cooperate with you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007793	Good.{nl}The Liverworts and Stonacons around here would be enough. Please also bring the proofs.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007794	You can give up if you feel that's too much for you.{nl}We were gonna finish it ourselves.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007795	You definitely possess the competence. We also have the same objective.{nl}There is no reason to insist anymore.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007796	The senior monk here is very picky.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007797	I will gather the monks in front of the entrance of the monastery, so tell the Hunters to gather as well.{nl}After they are here, we will unleash the seals to block any monsters from following us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007798	But, although we retrieved the monastery, don't expect us to expel Evoniphon.{nl}The abbot will decide everything after he comes out from the Prayer Room.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007799	Please understand that we could only do this.{nl}We've only listened to your story.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007800	What Guus said also makes sense.{nl}As they gather in front of the monastery, we should have some decisive evidence that would withdraw Evoniphon's declaration.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007801	I think we would have enough time.{nl}I am sorry, but please go back to Guus and ask him what happened when Evoniphon was coming.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007802	You can't prove that he was a cruel assassin.{nl}We can't release the ones that are being protected in the sanctuary by just guessing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007803	What they said about the traps and the monsters that conquered the monastery are also the same.{nl}It's only an one-sided story that this was done by Evoniphon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007804	We are the people who pray for the generosity of the goddesses.{nl}So to withdraw the protection of Evoniphon, you should show them some decisive evidence.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007805	Hmm. I remember that clearly.{nl}One day, someone named Evoniphon knocked on the door of the monastery. With his wounded body...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007806	After bringing him inside, I began to cure him.{nl}He also requested to protect the sanctuary at our monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007807	That's right. Before he came on that day, one man who seemed to be affected by the poison also came.{nl}He was gravely ill, so he passed away before I could even ask him a question.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007808	His grave is in Fasadu Rest Area. With his keepsakes.{nl}Ah, Evoniphon also asked me whether there was someone who came before him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007809	The man affected by the poison... I am sure he ran away from Evoniphon.{nl}But why did he run away from Evoniphon...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007810	There weren't any other things besides that.{nl}Did this help you?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007811	It's not good for the deceased, but I think I should look for his keepsakes from his grave.{nl}I need to find out why Evoniphon was chasing after him. Please, you have to help me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007812	Did you find anything?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007813	This is the directory of Schaffenstar.{nl}There's a letter in the middle of it... This is the seal of Schaffenstar. Let's rip it off.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007814	This is the request letter for murder and the confirmation of the receipt. The receiver is Evoniphon...{nl}I think Evoniphon thought this letter would be at the monastery.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007815	I am sure that Evoniphon caused the mess of the monsters to look for this. It was easy for him to do this.{nl}This is decisive evidence. Let's show it to Guus.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007816	Murder request... this is decisive evidence.{nl}The abbot would think differently when he sees this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007817	All the other monks are ready and went in front of the monastery.{nl}Let's go. I will see you in front of the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007818	Everything is clear now.{nl}I will go to the entrance of the monastery first. Let's join there together.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007819	You have come?{nl}We are ready to enter the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007820	Everyone seems to be gathering in front of the monastery.{nl}Let's hurry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007821	I thought it was a manner not to touch it since it was his last keepsake.{nl}How would anyone have thought it would turn out like this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007822	Everyone knows that the Hunter Master and the Ranger Master are chasing after Evoniphon.{nl}But, the reason why no one could step forward is because they didn't have any decisive evidence.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007823	Now, it is different. This letter is the evidence.{nl}Since we have the seal of Schaffenstar, we don't have to worry about it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007824	This place is dangerous... I miss the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007825	I want to be safe until I go back to the monastery.{nl}But the monsters near here are very threatening.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007826	There will be lots of monsters if we move out a bit from the hills.{nl}I'll be counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007827	Now, I can relax until I go back to the monastery.{nl}Thank you so much. I hope the goddesses bless you...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007828	We don't have enough water to drink here. It is strange since this place is full of water.{nl}After this place turned into a thorny forest, we can't drink it without purifying it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007829	If we have Asilado water plant, we can purify it with that.{nl}But, I am too scared of the monsters... Can you obtain some of them?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007830	We would last for a while even if there's no food, but not without drinkable water.{nl}I hope you would help us.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007831	Wow. You've collected a lot.{nl}Thank you so much. We will use these water plants well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007832	We need help due to the monsters!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007833	I didn't expect someone to come at this dangerous place...{nl}I am observing the movements of the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007834	After we are done, everyone would gather here. {nl}I am worried that they may lose their energies due to the monsters before retrieving the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007835	There are more dangerous monsters inside the monastery.{nl}We don't have a chance if we lose all our energies here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007836	Thank you.{nl}But, I am worried since there are still many monsters left.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007837	Are you trying to help me more?{nl}If that's so, it will be really appreciated...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007838	We've cleaned up many monsters. {nl}One more thing... I want you to do the last task.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007839	Thanks for your efforts.{nl}When the monks ask me, I will tell them to pray to the goddesses to protect you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007840	{memo X}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007841	We've recovered the hall. Let's continue on without taking a rest.{nl}Mintz... please take the rear since the monsters may follow.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007842	It doesn't look easy from here.{nl}There are many monsters in the hallway so let's be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007843	We ended up like this while moving fast to save the abbot...{nl}We will move again after we get some rest so please go first.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007844	{memo X}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007845	{memo X}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007846	We barely saved the abbot.{nl}Thanks for your efforts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007847	{memo X}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007848	{memo X}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007849	Are you talking about the crystal sphere?{nl}I can't move it out at all so I hid it inside the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007850	It's so good to recover the monastery, but when are we going to finish cleaning it...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007851	It was a really important object so I put it in the box first.{nl}Inside the reception room. If you find it, please take it to Guus.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007852	I have to protect this place so I can't go with you.{nl}There aren't many boxes so you will find it easily.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007853	Yes. That's the crystal sphere.{nl}Please bring it to Guus.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007854	Abbot
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007855	Thanks for resolving the crisis.{nl}I can feel the goddesses are protecting you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007856	So you've come. Soon, the abbot would come out.{nl}Please wait a bit here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007857	Why is the monastery like this and why are you all gathered here?{nl}And you... you seem to have some business with me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007858	He is the abbot of the Tyla Monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007859	We barely managed to come this far so I am hoping for good results.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007860	So you are asking me to withdraw my declaration to protect Evoniphon.{nl}You came this far to do that...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007861	Okay. I will discuss with the abbot.{nl}Can you wait until then?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007862	I will wait for their decision here first.{nl}If their declaration doesn't get withdrawn, then I should think about what to do at then.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007863	So it seems that their discussion is over.{nl}Let's go there and listen to their conclusion.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007864	We haven't finished our discussion.{nl}Please wait with the Hunters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007865	After we've discussed with the senior monks...{nl}We've decided to withdraw our declaration to protect Evoniphon.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007866	From this point on, Evoniphon won't be protected by Tyla Monastery and we request Evoniphon to leave at once.{nl}Also, we are not going to be involved with others' decision to punish him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007867	I hope the goddessess will be with you on your rest of journey.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007868	Besides from the expulsion, we can't forgive his actions that ruined the monastery.{nl}We should find him since he should be here somewhere.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007869	He made the monastery like this due to that letter. {nl}Please be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007870	He is so cunning..{nl}The Hunters are surrounding this place so he will get caught within a short period of time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007871	We would have had hard time without your help.{nl}Thank you so much for your efforts. I pray that the goddesses be with you on your journey.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007872	If it wasn't for your help, the circumstances would have not been like this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007873	I've read it from the book before. {nl}Some smell has the power to pull the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007874	I should've noticed when Evoniphon brought that lump... I didn't expect that would be enlarged this big...{nl}We are eliminating them as we see them, but I want you to help us as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007875	We are luring the monsters with the smell so it won't be effective if you just destroy them.{nl}Please destroy the lumps using this liquid medicine.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007876	When I saw it, it was about the size of my palm so I don't understand how it got that big.{nl}This is all my fault...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007877	I don't know how long it would take to drive those monsters out...{nl}But now is the time to start.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007878	We were able to retrieve the monastery, but as you can see there are still full of monsters.{nl}Could you help us little more?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007879	Orange Kowaks inside the monastery are most problematic.{nl}They are the most violent and vicious monsters among the monsters that came into the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007880	They are still inside.{nl}Please eliminate the monsters including them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007881	The number of monsters won't increase from this point on.{nl}But, in order to eliminate them completely, we would need lots of time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007882	The goddesses helped us to retrieve the monastery.{nl}Lots of other sacred places are still occupied by many monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007883	It's a mess. {nl}The monsters are sweeping across the monastery so the books are all scattered.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007884	When would we able to gather all these books again and divide them into different categories...{nl}If you pick up scriptures, please bring them to me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007885	You don't have to try hard.{nl}I can collect them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150714_007886	Thanks.{nl}We should be able to gather all of them again right?
