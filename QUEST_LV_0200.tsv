QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000042	I'm telling you he's acting like that even though I bought him a roughly similar one. So petty.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000043	What is this dirty object? Oh, could a ring be inside?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000044	A knife won't fit inside and there's no other method of removing it.{nl}Right! Can't we burn it to retrieve what's inside?

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000084	Why does the human's soul contain so many things?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000085	If we meet the monsters, we'll have no choice but to fight.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000086	We're working to pass through the Gateway of Great King.{nl}Have you heard the news about Ironbaum?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000087	In order to be a leader of a group, you need unperturbed principles.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000096	Like the grudge is so sad.{nl}It's sad that we can't do anything either.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000097	The sacrifice will continue unless someone stops the demons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000098	Joint Investigation Team Fray
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000099	I'm Fray.{nl}Listening to the story, the situation sounds bad.{nl}If the information you and Scott researched is correct.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000100	{nl}Then, I will have to do something.[nl}Please defeat some Red Vubbes first. They have been bothering me lately.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000101	Please, I ask of you. .{nl}I get sick just looking at the red color.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000102	Oh, did you really defeat them for me?{nl}Thank you!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000103	I got something after talking with Scott.{nl}There are Woodman kind of a moving tree sculpture.{nl}Is it somehow related with the bark of a tree that the Vubbes got?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000104	By the way, there is still no news form Scott about a second report.{nl}I wonder what happened to our cute Scott? Hmm..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000105	Wow, great!{nl}I owe you one. Thank you!

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000107	I will take this combined result of the information Scott gave me and this fragment to my superior. {nl}By the way, There is still no news from Scott. Even the time Scott promised has long since passed. Just using the hearsay is not enough for the other investigator?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000108	Could you pick up the report from Scott?{nl}Do not forget to scold him for skipping work!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000109	Please handle Scott's report. Okay?{nl}Sometimes, he is stupid, but he is also cute.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000110	I have no face. Nowadays, I have been investigating everywhere to find something..{nl}Thanks a lot. If you are not..{nl}Ah, I don't want to think about it.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000112	Ah, it is the report! {nl}Good, and what was Scott doing?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000113	Really? He couldn't handle a single Vubbe and got in trouble instead.{nl}Such a shame..I will scold him later!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000114	Everything is messy. {nl}I can not concentrate as the Vubbes.{nl}He must laugh, If he look at it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000115	Joint Investigation Team Fray
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000116	It is still in progress to find the truth of the events.{nl}Take it. It's a soul collection scroll.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000117	Once you defeat the Red Vubbe using this scroll, the soul of Vubbe should be out?{nl}I'll have you collect it for me. Then, the data are almost done.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000118	Do not forget the order.{nl}You have to defeat the Red Vubbes after using the soul collection scroll on them. Alright?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000119	About the bark of a tree that the Vubbe got.{nl}I think I can combine it using something like a spirit..{nl}Well, Please tell this news to Ukirt.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000120	Joint Investigation Team Ukirt
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000121	Scott and Fray did a good job. What do you think of it?{nl}I don't think so that Vubbe can't create themself.{nl}I will have to check what they do using this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000122	There may be something inside the supply boxes that the soldiers left a long time ago.{nl}You will find some old supply boxes up there.{nl}Can you go there and check? If we obtain some clues there, we may get an answer.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000123	If you go back the way you just came, you will see an observatory tower on the hills.{nl}I hope the monsters haven't touch it yet..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000124	Are they really planning something?{nl}Something.. is suspicious..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000125	The Vubbes broke the supply boxes and ran away with this?{nl}Why? Were they really making it?{nl}No way, they aren't smart enough to do that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000126	Good! We should pay attention and solve the problem!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000127	Okay. Are you ready?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000128	Before you came, I saw Vubbes moving in groups.{nl}Go to Gebene Cliffs and see how the situation is.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000129	The Vubbes were always involved with anything that happened here.{nl}It can't be a just coincedence..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000130	I think.. I understand now. {nl}I think that was like a big factory creating huge monsters called Woodspirits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000131	The flag of Vubbes must have called in the ghosts.{nl}Then they polluted the trees and created huge monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000132	That tree barks must have been the ingredients for making Woodspirits.{nl}There's no way those Vubbes could do it alone.{nl}They must have received an order from somebody!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000133	We may find some decisive evidences at the place where the Vubbes are grouped together.{nl}If Prey sees this, it will like it!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000134	Vubbes are not very smart so he must have made only simple orders.{nl}How could he think about controlling those Vubbes..{nl}I don't know what to say. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000135	I am sure that Woodspirits are created from various places.{nl}I can sense vicious energies coming. {nl}We should first destroy the flags that are creating Woodspirits!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000136	Leave as soon as you are ready. {nl}The best course of action for now is to stop the creation of Woodspirits..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000137	I think we've done our best for now. {nl}Since we can't do anything about the ones that were already created.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000138	I can feel the closest flag from here is near Gatves Highway.{nl}The huge trees that people saw is probably Woodspirits.{nl}How could I miss this simple thing.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000157	Ah, the way back is dark outside so it will be appreciated if you could light up the fireplace again.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000158	You can't see much sunlight at Katyn Forest due to the enormous amount of tress.{nl}It seems like ghosts would come out.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000159	Okay, so the messenger is safe?{nl}This place has been taken care of well thanks to you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000160	I shall take some rest here.{nl}Is there any good place to hide?

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000164	If you are okay, can you get rid of the monsters while we are protecting here?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000165	It is very unfortunate that we should take care of that woman this time.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000177	Can you retrieve the lost supplies?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000178	A few decades ago, the thieves attacked the guard camp and stole the supplies secretly.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000179	They lured us in front of them and stole the objects from behind so there was no way we could prevent them from stealing.{nl}They wanted to take the objects legally so they were sent to gallows.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000180	The number of Dico Thieves is growing.{nl}They are very close to monsters.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000184	A few weeks ago, the colleagues who used to work here received damage by Stone Frosts and became stone statues at the square. {nl}The reason why the colleagues received damage was because they were engaged in eliminating traps that the thieves had set, but could not avoid them.{nl}There are still many traps around. We recently found one of them. Can you get rid of it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000185	The number of Dico Thieves may be more than the number of guards.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000210	There are monsters who try to go after the soldiers who maintain the devices. Be careful.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000215	These guards had their lives threatened by the Sparnashorn and Stone Frosts. {nl}They are blinded by fear so they don't stand a chance fighting against it.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000223	Aren't you curious how I made it through the strict security? {nl}It's all becuase I have connections. There are some Kingdom soldiers who buy xxx claws to raise their work records. {nl}But actually, I don't want to be around those monsters. Especially with A's.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000224	Can you catch them and get me those claws?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000225	I think you misunderstood. We are archeologists, not thieves.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000226	This seems quite pricey. {nl}Thank you very much.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000227	You better stop if you're planning to get something from the Petrified City. {nl}Aside from us, there is the outrageous Diko grave thieves. {nl}But you might be at least rewarded if you help us out.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000228	In area A, there is a box that contains things the Diko thieves bring in from outside. Can you get them? {nl}I took a sneak peek and seems like they are not back yet.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000229	They are really clever. {nl}They bring in cheap antiques and place them where the Stone Frost blows. {nl}Then the antiques would petrify and turn into something that looks exquisite. {nl}I heard the nobles in big cities are fooled and buy them at expensive prices.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000230	Seems like Diko thieves are planning to make their business bigger than I thought. {nl}That's an enormous amount. Do you think they also have connections with the Royal Army?

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000237	Better work on it quickly because the Stone Frost just sweeped by. {nl}You can know when and where the Stone Frost starts if you observe the Royal Army's retreat. {nl}And the fastest way to get that information is by becoming a Kingdom soldier.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000238	Hush! Lower your voice. It will be the end of both of us if we get caught.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000239	Did that stupid Juvertas send you here? {nl}I told him many times that I'd go back if I'm done with my work here. {nl}I didn't know his stupidity would send someone. {nl}There is a big problem here actually.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000240	Our family can't come into the city from outside. {nl}We need your help. {nl}We can't bring in my family without the troops knowing. {nl}They should all be gone from here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000241	I'm going to make a big fuss in area A. I'm going to call in Salister that are roaming around the area. {nl}In order to do this, you need to gather Scented Stone Powder from the monsters. Can you do it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000242	Our families should have passed this place earlier than the Royal Army. {nl}But Retia hurried things when the Stone Frost swept by some time ago so we weren't able to.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000243	This is exactly right. {nl}If you pour this here, you will soon see the Salister show up it's huge self. {nl}But that is not our plan!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000244	We should not make this place a battlefield. Then our families can't pass through. {nl}Let's think for a while..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000245	Apply this powder on x monster that appear in area B. {nl}Then the bewitched Salister will attack them. {nl}Retia will not just stand and watch her area be invaded like that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000246	Our families come from various areas. I was also once a junior officer with dreams to become a strategist. {nl}Of course, it was before the area I was assigned to completely disappeared from the map 4 years ago on Medis Diena.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000247	Did you use everything? {nl}Then now it's time to get busy!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000248	Go to Retia and tell her that Salister is coming. {nl}She won't believe it but I can already feel the Salister running at us. {nl}Hurry!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000249	You just have to tell her that Salister is coming. {nl}There is no reason for her to suspect us.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000250	Our families passed through this place thanks to you. {nl}You will find many interesting truths if you continue your journey in this area. {nl}And you may also meet our families. But be careful of the Diko thieves. {nl}Unlike us, they were robbers from the beginning.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000252	I don't want to be here either. There's really no need to guard this place. {nl}Orders came in to support the Kaliss Knights.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000253	Can you help me? {nl}Kostas has not come back for days so I can't leave this place but the monsters are running wild so I can't just stay put.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000254	The officers don't like the Kaliss Knights. {nl}As for lower rank guards like me, Kaliss Knights give us supplies and support so there's no reason for us to hate them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000255	When I first came here, we just had to be careful of the Stone Frosts but since Medis Diena 4 years ago, every day is a crisis. {nl}I'm going to apply to move out when I'm done here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000256	It hasn't been that long for the Royal Army to enter this area by the request of Kostas. {nl}Much of the city remained in it's original form 600 years after the misfortune. {nl}One of my missions here is to clear the records of rebels remaining here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000257	I can't leave my post since Kostas is not here. Can you take care of it for me? {nl}You can find many records if you look around the trade area and Parduo square area.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000258	Don't mind what's written on the records. {nl}It's all nonsense.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000259	I have to escort, clean up, and guard. I wonder how they are expecting me to do everything alone. {nl}It's a good thing you came to help.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000260	A few days before I was dispatched here, many soldiers came to this place to do a preliminary check for the research of Kaliss Knights. {nl}But no one returned. They were attacked by the irregular Stone Frosts.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000261	I was ordered to take back their keepstakes but it's hard just to think about it. {nl}Can you help me out?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000262	The authorities do not take it well that tens of soldiers were sacrificed for support activities. {nl}That's why the Royal Army and the Kaliss Knights have become distant.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000263	You may not believe it but I might have been standing there too. {nl}Good thing I was off duty that day.. I don't even want to think about it. {nl}I will deliver this to the families of the deceased.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000264	How are you traveler, although, I don't know why you are passing through this place..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000265	Ah, so you are the famous Revelator. I've heard a lot about you from my colleagues in Klaipeda. {nl}They say you go around to save the world according to the will of the Goddess?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000266	Then let me make a good offer, I found a way to turn back this petrified city. Can you help me? {nl}First, get rid of the monsters around here. I have to be safe first before I can tell you anything, right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000267	The Cryomancers in Klaipeda are stubborn and arrogant. If you feel something like that from me, then that's your delusion. {nl}There is Cryomancer as humane and warm-hearted as me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000268	Did you dry the seeds? Good, anyway.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000269	Now, the next test is for you to take this and test if it's usable while I find the formula of magic circle. {nl}An Ice wall will appear if you use this so check how useful that is to the monsters. {nl}We need a safety net in order to test and this will do the job.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000270	The monsters will come attacking when the Ice wall is formed so take care of the rest of the monsters that you missed a while ago.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000271	Stone Frost will not happen anymore for a while. {nl}Don't worry about that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000272	It's very effective! Now this should be able to block monsters or revelators.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000273	Now we get to the important part. The most important part of the test is to find the Mark of Silk, a strong magic tool that can turn back petrified things. {nl}The stupid Royal Army lost the last Mark in this area 4 years ago so it's probably somewhere around here. {nl}It can also be inside the monster's stomach.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000274	Defeat the monsters and get the shiny stone from them. That will shine by itself so bring that and I will look for it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000275	The stupid Royal Army probably doesn't know how great that Mark is. {nl}Probably no one knows, except me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000276	Pray that the Mark of Silk is among these stones. {nl}If not, I will be really mad.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000277	Aha! It's here. Why wasn't the Royal Army able to find it when it is so easy like this? {nl}Are their heads only good for wearing helmets? Anyway, let's begin the test. Follow me to the magic circle I installed.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000278	Hey friend, how did you get here? {nl}Are you looking for a job? {nl}I might sound a bit nosy but It's dangerous to go around alone. {nl}Of course, the same goes for anyone else too.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000279	I need to work in the commercial area but I can't work alone because of the monsters. {nl}Can you help me out?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000280	It's a good thing the cowardly Diko thieves did not come until here. {nl}Things are limited but people are coming in flocks to take it away..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000281	If it's cleared up that much, then looks like I can start already.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000282	I'm gonna go to Gerove Workshop. Can you help me out while I work? {nl}You jsut have to follow me around and fight the monsters while I do the work.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000283	I got a load of it thanks to you. I won't have to go around for days. {nl}I plan to wait here until my colleagues arrive.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000284	Please take care of the monsters and grave thieves in the Military District while I prepare the test. {nl}We should not be caught or interrupted.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000285	It's relatively safe on top of the fortress. There are monsters and thieves swarming if you leave this place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000286	You cleared the test areas. Good job.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000287	I will proceed the test from up here. {nl}Please go to the portal and prepare to test it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000288	Everything will be alright. It's all just visuals and it can't come across to this world.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000289	Something outrageous happened. What could those be? {nl}Chronomancers will not believe it. Did the past interfere with the future? Or the future interfere with the past?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000290	I better stay here and tune the portal leading to Final Battle Field.

A big commotion will happen and the guards will find them. {nl}I want you to get your hands on at that point. Unlike the Diko thieves, they can't stand to be in debt so they will be helpful to your journey.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000294	They are more than just a few so we don't know when they will pass through. {nl}But we continuously watch over so that nothing will go wrong.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000295	Did you defeat the monsters? The guards were asking what the fuss is about so I told them about you. {nl}Everything should be alright.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000296	Don't forget. Our helping the grave thieves here is a secret to the Royal Army. {nl}Your life can be on the line.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000352	If my presumptions are correct, there is a high possibility that all of the things happening here are results of someone's sinister spell. {nl}In order to check, we need elixirs to drag out whoever it is. {nl}Can you defeat the monsters in Sacred port and get those?

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000838	We're making up for the lacking supplies. {nl}If the supplies don't arrive, we have to cover for it on site.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001064	Austeja Goddess is sealing two spots that are the source of the vicious energy.{nl}However, due to demons' continuous attacks, the seal is getting weaker.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001065	That's why we lured the demons into demonic stones..{nl}Hasty behavior from the villagers created the trouble.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001066	You can never say that you are not responsible for this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001067	I don't know if it is due to Medis Diena, but the vicious energy started to gather from deep inside the ground.{nl}The energy started to accumulate a lot and was about to explode.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001068	Austeja Goddess is trying her best to seal that energy.{nl}If she doesn't do that, this forest would turn into Vine Forest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001069	The only living creatures are monsters.. I am talking about the land that much devastated.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001070	I want to explain about the circumstances a bit, but the monsters will come this way soon.{nl}To prepare for this kind of moment, we've prepared the protecting stone on the edge of the village.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001072	I will explain it to you in details after you come back.{nl}Please get rid of the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001073	I am now a little relieved.{nl}My greeting was a bit late. I am the disciple Raelie serving Austeja Goddess.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001074	You mean the purification before?{nl}Unlike the other revelators who were lured to the vicious energy, I purifed you in the name of the goddess.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001075	The goddesses already blessed the villagers, but they don't know about it well.{nl}The goddesses don't want chaos.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001076	It is good to hear that you feel responsible for it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001077	We have something to gain from purifying those demons.{nl}Please obtain the branches of bee trees that are endowed with the power of the goddess near the village.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001078	We should complete it quickly before the monsters rush in again.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001079	You brought them. Good.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001080	I told you a while ago that there are two sources of vicious energy.{nl}Among them, I will make a bead that will restore the seal that is located here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001081	First, bring me the ashes of demons to be used as ingredient for the bead.{nl}When you pierce the demon with the branch of the bee tree, it won't be able to resist the divine power and become ashes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001082	But of course, the power of Goddess resides indirectly in it. {nl}So you will have to consume some of the demon's HP before using it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001083	Good work. {nl}It's a uncomfortable to use demons as sacrifice.. Now we're in the final step.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001084	Take this bead. I made it in a hurry so it's not yet complete. {nl}You must fill it with the divine spell of the Goddess.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001085	Palama Cliff is the nearest place for it so please head there. {nl}The demons will soon be marching in so hurry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001086	This will be enough. {nl}Please prepare to restore the seal. It might become a huge fight.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001087	The weak seal tower is in the near Stula Road. {nl}It bothers me that the demons were calm until now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001088	Please hurry. I can feel that the seal is weak. {nl}May you have the Goddess' blessings..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001089	Are you the revelator who purified the Seal Tower?

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001093	That would be so thankful. {nl}But you don't know how dangerous it could be so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001094	So could it be the evil forces that turned it to become so grotesque?

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001106	Are you trying to comfort me? {nl}Then nothing would be better than showing those monsters a lesson.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001107	I know the priest is right but I can still rant about it, right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001108	That feels better. {nl}How I wish they'd be gone forever.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001109	Priest Dajine
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001110	Dear revelator. I assume you've heard from Goddess Austeja. {nl}The other revelators who were dazzled by evil forces will attack the village before restoring the seal. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001111	But there is a way. {nl}We can purify it if we find the symbol of the Goddess.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001112	First regain the symbol of the Goddess and then restore the Altar of Austeja. {nl} Purifying revelators are next.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001113	Whether it's restoring the weakened seal or curing the dazzled revelators, {nl}it will need that symbol.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001114	The damage is worse than at the seal in the shaking field. {nl}The evil forces are fuming out stronger.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001115	Fortunately, the Goddess returned the Divine symbol to the villagers before going all in on the seal.. {nl}The innocent revelators did not know about it and got themselves in danger.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001116	This is it. {nl}This will save the dazzled revelators.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001117	The dazzled revelators will start to march in soon. {nl}Please purify them before anyone gets hurt.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001118	Luckily, the damage is minimal. {nl}Now, if we only get to restore the seal, this will never have to repeat.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001119	Restore the weakened Seal Tower using the symbol of Goddess Austeja.{nl}It's the Rankis seal and Ranka seal.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001120	The demons found out about the source of evil force and continued their attacks to destroy the seal. {nl}I'm sure if the seal is strengthened well this time, they will draw out for a while.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001121	But we don't know what will happen next.{nl} We just believe that Goddess Austeja will take care of this matter if anything happens.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001122	But one thing that worries me is that.. {nl}The symbol was destroyed once so it might not be fully restored again. {nl}Of course everything will depend.. on the Goddess..{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001147	That's why I brought the beads that can detect holiness{nl}but look at those monsters' eyes. {nl}They might kill us as soon as we find the sacred things.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003454	I don't know when those monsters appear again so I can't leave this place. I can't also let the baron do it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003455	It will be quite for some time. {nl} Thanks.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003474	Yes. That's right. Thanks.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003477	{nl}Okay. Take these and scatter them.{nl}This is one of the methods for the enhancement. I made it to prepare times like this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003478	Use the poison to enhance the magic field?..{nl}I am not sure if its right, but let's try it anyways.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003479	I've collected that poison from the monsters.{nl}The monsters are very vicious and hard.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003495	The monsters have something that looks like a hard core.{nl}That is harder than a stone so if one gets hit by that, its quite lethal.{nl}And I think it would be better to get those from the monsters instead of getting stones here where the stones are not hard enough.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003496	We will take care of our own tasks
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003497	That's enough.{nl}Thank you so much.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003501	I am sorry that I had to make you do this kind of work.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003514	Dried food is better to keep it for a long time.{nl}Especially, you will feel full when you consume only a little amount of beef jerky.{nl}That's why we are accumulating them a lot.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003526	Over the fence, there is an altar that the villagers used to do ritual ceremonies.{nl}But due to the strong monster that the baron left here, we can't do ritual ceremonies anymore.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003527	I can only guess.{nl}I am sure that something serious is going on here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003528	Be careful.{nl}It is very vicious.{nl}I am keep trying, but I always failed.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003529	Oh my god!{nl}Thank you so much!

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003532	Cheer up! Revelator!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003533	Ohoh, you succeeded!{nl}Now this place is going back to its normal status.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003534	There's a magic field in this region as well.{nl}We should break that.{nl}But, the monsters are always disturbing us..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003535	Just think that the monsters don't have brains.{nl}They are not on the baron side and they are also not on our side.{nl}They always cause troubles and they disturb our tasks.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003536	I feel so relieved to see that you are so enthusiastic.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003537	We are almost there! The moment of restoration!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003538	There are lots of tasks to do for the restoration.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003539	The pieces that you gave to me are not normal.{nl}These must be.. those barons must have manipulated something on this land and destructed them.{nl}You collected all these..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003540	{nl}Can I trust you?{nl}Hmm, then..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003541	I am collecting the clues here.{nl}I can't tell you in details, but I am preparing something big.{nl}We should have some reasons to persuade the farmers and the villagers to do that task.{nl}I am collecting those.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003542	First, I should glue these pieces together. Can you get me some sticky fluid from the monsters?{nl}I will try to glue them with it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003543	{nl}I feel.. I feel like ruining the divinity, but I have no choice since I am running out of the supplies.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003544	We don't have enough sticky fluid.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003545	Okay that would be enough. Give it to me.{nl}I will try to glue them together.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003546	To prepare the big task that we will do in the near future, I am collecting the clues to persuade the farmers.{nl}I mean.. since the baron is wrong, I am telling you to get a revenge on the plunderings and the cruelties.{nl}.. I will tell you that much.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003547	I mean, we should take the monster to the magic field down there.{nl}In order to succeed the experiment, it would be better to extract the half of the blood from it.{nl}And then make it react to the magic field.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003548	You are understanding correctly right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003549	Yes.{nl}It really was like that. Monsters fall into the eternal sleep.. dying..{nl}The monsters are dying due to the energy coming from there..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003550	Yonaris
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003551	From the one day, the crops here do not grow anymore.{nl}Even after I scatter the seeds a lot.{nl}So I am thinking maybe the reason of it is related to the magic field that was created by the fellows of the baron.{nl}Can you help me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003552	As you can see, this place is full of water.{nl}The place full of water means that this land is very fertile.{nl}But, you can see it right? The crops at some places are not growing.{nl}It's not that all the fields are like that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003553	When you see the place near the magic field, you will see the monsters with flames on them.{nl}Long time ago, I was able to put the flames on some of them in order to eliminate the magic field, but after that I was so busy here.{nl}When you go there and put them into the magic field, the field will break.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003554	Still not completed?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003555	Wow amazing.{nl}Thanks!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003556	But, the magic fields are still left.{nl}Is there some way we could borrow the mighty power of the goddesses..{nl}Only if there were the statues of the goddesses..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003557	Starting from the one day, those barons' plunderings increased a lot and many magic fields were created a lot. Somehow, some of them were less shiny.{nl}Anyways, when you get near the bright ones, it will be hard to eliminate them since you may get hurt.{nl}Of course, the most difficult task is to avoid the eyes of the barons and continue to do this task.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003558	{nl}I don't know exactly who you are, but you are the perfect candidate to help us since you are not well known here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003559	Yoana has it?{nl}If we put them in the magic field, don't you think the field would break?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003560	You came well at the right time. I tied them up with the sticky fluid.{nl}.. As I expected. This is the statue of the goddess.{nl}You tied them up with the fluid from the monsters.. I am so sorry..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003561	{nl}You need this? Take it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003562	I am counting on you.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003567	It's lacking.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003568	Ah, thank you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003569	There is an unstable sealed magic field down there. {nl}The baron told me that the seal which prevents the strange energy spurting out from the places nearby is not perfect yet so the energy is leaking out. However, the problem is that it doesn't look like that.{nl}It is suspicious.{nl}Now we have to tie up these pieces, so can you find more about the energy on behalf of me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003570	Hmm.. It is almost completed now.{nl}We have enough reasons.. the food, almost everything.{nl}Now, we just have one more to go..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003571	My wish is not something big. We just want to live.{nl}Harvest for one year and stay full until the next harvest. {nl}We, farmers want only that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003572	{nl}If that one thing doesn't get accomplished, we have no choice, but to stand up.{nl}Against the source of the plunderings.{nl}Also if the process of the plunderings ruin the mighty power of the goddess, and the objective of the plunderings results from the greed of one person, we do have to get mad about it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003573	We do have to check whether the farmers would particpate.{nl}I will give you the sheet so please get their signatures on the sheet.{nl}Along with the date for the execution, this sheet confirms that we all act together for the same purpose.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003574	{nl}How could I request this to you..{nl}I am so sorry. If this gets completed, we will do the rest ourselves.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003575	This task will give you some trouble.{nl}The farmers are not that simple.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003576	Completed!{nl}Now you go on your way!{nl}I can't leave the completion of the task to you. That's too much burden for you.{nl}Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003577	To do a big task..{nl}We should accumulate some clues.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003578	Ah, What should I do..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003579	Leader Horaces
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003580	More we prepare, better off we are.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003581	Now, leave the things to us here.{nl}Thank you so much for everything so far.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003582	I mean the second secret. {nl}Unfortunately, it seems that the subordinates of Naktis moved first.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003583	I am investigating here how to solve the curse of Naktis here.{nl}For the ones who are suffering from the curse, can you get me the samples of the demons?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003584	Damn. We should begin experiments instead of imagining things.{nl}I am sorry, but could you get me the samples of other demons?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003585	How come the goddesses leave those filthy demons like that..{nl}Is this also what the goddesses want?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003586	We should just finish it before it gets in the hands of Naktis.{nl}Defeat the demons and find the divine artifacts of the salvation.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003587	We don't have much time left to stay in the great cathedral.{nl}In the meantime, we should find the clues to unleash the curse.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003588	We should find how the curse of Naktis influences the psychology of humans..{nl}It's so difficult.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003589	The great cathedral is like the repository of knowledges.{nl}If you find those documents, you will easily find a way how to face against Naktis.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003590	If no one maintains it, it collapses easily.{nl}Even a great architecture.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003591	I knew that the great cathedral would stand still even on Medis Diena.{nl}But, the attacks of Naktis were not something that could be endured.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003592	4 years have passed since the congregation ordered to move out..{nl}Everything about the great cathedral is meaningless now due to the curse of Naktis.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003593	Disciple Ruodell
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003594	Hmm, I know it is an order from the congregation, but we should first retrieve the great cathedral..{nl}Then we would be able to get an answer for the curse as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003595	I don't know when would we able to find the way to unleash the curse if it continues like this.{nl}If I only have the power, I would have driven all demons out from the great cathedral.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003596	Disciple Yosana
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003597	The congregation told us that they will retrieve the great cathedral if the curse of Naktis gets solved.{nl}It doesn't make sense to leave the great cathedral, which supports the goddesses like that for 4 years.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003598	We lost many documents in the great cathedral due to the subordinates of Naktis.{nl}When I think about that right now, I feel so bad that we lost them.. Those were over hundred years old..

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003602	Thank you so much!{nl}I need fresh ones instead of old ones.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003603	I think the medicine is ready now.{nl}Okay.. how should I feed now.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003611	Ah, can you send this report to Aden if you get a chance to go back to the main church?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003612	The revelation is being protected by the five keys of Maven.{nl}To get the keys, you should solve more secrets.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003613	Then I should go back to your small pocket for a minute.{nl}Do not trust anyone.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003614	The goddesses want you and Haubuck to defeat the pawns of Blud so that the 1st zone gets released from the control of the demons.{nl}To do so, you should disturb the conciousness of the subordinates who try to free the bluds.{nl}Could you defeat the monsters at the gathering place of Rituala?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003615	Blut's
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003616	They tried to break the loosened barriers and run away outside.{nl}Get some help from Haubucks if you can.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003617	Well done. I feel that the barriers in this region are more enhanced now.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003623	The only way to weaken Blut is to get the secreting glands that Blut shared with his subordinates and weaken his influence.{nl}There are Blut's guys near Byeaulleo Hideout. Get the secreting glands of Bluts from them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003624	The goddess is facing against the demon lord somewhere in the prison.{nl}She desperately needs help from you and Haubuck.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003626	The battle with Blut will be hard for us.{nl}Haubuck should help us. We should grant the substance to Haubuck again.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003627	{nl}Blut sealed his power at his altar for his escape.{nl}If Haubuck could absorb that, it will be a great help to us.{nl}Go to the concentrated area. Control the altar there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003628	{nl}If you succeed on granting substance to Haubuck, please go see Gidrone.{nl}We are really running out of time now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003629	The power of the demons reject the power of the goddesses. Only Haubuck can do this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003630	Were you able to grant the substance to Haubuck? It is so fortunate.{nl}Everything will go as the goddesses wish..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003631	I locked Blut in the barrier of the prison, but it won't stand long.{nl}When we are prepared, we should defeat it with Haubuck.{nl}If we lose, Vakarine also would fall down.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003635	Well done. Now I am relieved.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003636	The investigation team formed by humans came here lately.{nl}However, they could not get out and died here.{nl}The demons carry their belongings like their booties.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003637	{nl}If you could retrieve them, I will hand them over to their families when this place becomes stabilized.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003642	I am worried about Aldona at Nuaele's place..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003643	Even if we fail to defeat Nuaele, we reduced the number of his followers who would listen to his orders so I think it would be safe for some time..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003644	All demons here were the followers of Haubuck at this place.{nl}Haubuck knows well about that. {nl}Haubuck was granted with the substance, but I am sure he is still unstable.

We don't know what he is waiting for.{nl}We should interrogate the subordinates of Nuaele to find out what that is.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003650	{nl}I will give you this marble that I received from the goddesses.{nl}Kupoles can't use this anymore since the control of the goddesses in the prison became weak.{nl}But since Haubuck helps you, you will be able to read the minds of the demons.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003807	The leather and the dagger with the magic field engraved on them.{nl}Unfortunately, they are not my specialities so I don't know about them well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003808	From this place, it will be better if we ask Bokor Master.{nl}No one can compete with him in terms of spells.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003809	You want to know what spell is casted upon these objects?{nl}Hmm. It is a very filthy spell.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003810	That's right. This spell spreads the poison that is pasted on the dagger.{nl}Everything near it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003811	You will find the answer to the question when you ask Bokor Master.{nl}I am sorry that I can't help you anymore.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003812	But, I don't know what this poison is.{nl}But the dagger.. How about you go meet Ranger Master?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003813	This dagger. Where is this from?{nl}Before you make me mad, you better tell me fast.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003814	Ranger Master studied daggers for some time in the past.{nl}That was due to Ebonipon..Anyways he will give you the answer.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003815	They were casted with the spell to spread the poison on that land?{nl}Hmm. I received a help from the unexpected place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003816	Anyways, this dagger belongs to Ebonipon. You can know by looking at the shape of the blade and the symbol. {nl}But I can't detoxify it. Anyways, we've got some clues.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003817	Don't worry about that. Hunter master knows well about the poison.{nl}He is chasing after Ebonipon with me so he will definitely welcome you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003818	Can I help you with anything?{nl}So you want to know how to detoxify this poison...
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003819	How could he dare come to Klaipeda..{nl}Ebonipon. I will not miss you this time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003820	What happened to Pyromancer's task?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003821	So should I just report about the task to Pyromancer Master?

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003823	I should reward you since you helped me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003824	These are the research documents. Tell Creomancer Master that you would hand over the research documents on behalf of Gitise.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003825	It is so fortunate that it resolved well enough.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003826	These are the research documents that I asked from Gitise. I will use them well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003827	Please take it to him quickly.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003829	Soldier Denise
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003830	The expiry date for the farm construction is coming.{nl}Monsters have became suddenly vicious so the workers can't get their touches on them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003831	The other soldiers went to defeat Gorgon and I can't leave this place.{nl}The only one I can trust is you. I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003832	Really? Thanks..{nl}The location is the joint arable land. I am counting on you!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003833	Do you think this makes sense?{nl}Those monsters used to be scared of humans, but they now attack humans with their poison.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003834	If it weren't you, Uska must have scolded me.. Thank you so much.{nl}Anyways, how come there is no order of return?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003835	Ah, I am worried about it too much.{nl}I heard the monsters here were naive before, but they turned violent suddenly.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003836	I don't know how the world would be like.{nl}And Alan, my colleague. He is protecting the entrance gate of the farm himself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003837	Can you really do that?{nl}If that's so, please take care of Alan before the other soldiers return.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003838	Soldier Alan
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003839	Don't come! Monsters are coming!{nl}Damn, How would I able to stand anymore alone..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003840	It's so fortunate that you are here.{nl}How come I can't hear anything from the soldiers who went to defeat Gorgon.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003841	Was Alan okay?{nl}It is so fortunate that you were here, otherwise the whole district would have been swept away.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003842	So you are the revelator that I heard from the rumors. Thank you so much.{nl}I don't know why those monsters turned out like that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003843	Louise
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003844	I received the farm land from Gitese, but it's such a mess.{nl}Especially Ridimed. But, what can I do with my hands that only touched hoes before.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003845	I didn't know what to do, but it was so fortunate that I've met the goddesses.{nl}I am counting on you. It's already late to manage the crops.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003846	So you really drove that tedious Ridimed away?{nl}That's such a good news.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003847	It's so good to hear that you drove the Ridimed away.{nl}Now we should think about what to do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003848	I think it would be helpful if you can at least make a fence.{nl}Can you help me little more?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003849	There are lots of woods from the cut down trees at the cultivation area.{nl}If you could bring me those, maybe we can make a fence.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003850	Among the farms that were damaged on Medis Diena, there are lots of farms that can't be recovered.{nl}They either received vicious energies or there are too many monsters in them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003851	So it is Uska's thought that you should make the farm again by cultivating the forest.{nl}The restoration at the moment is important, but we can't do anything if we can't obtain the food supplies.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003852	If the monsters were naive, I would have done it myself.{nl}We didn't have to make the fence in the first place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003853	Fortunately the woods are normal.{nl}Please wait a bit. I will make the fence quickly.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003854	The scarecrow should scare the monsters, but it's size is too small.{nl}You should increase the size of the scarecrow. It will be good if you could use monsters' fluffy hair.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003855	The size of the scarecrow should be bigger than humans.{nl}I will increase the size of the scarecrow using the hair of the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003856	Good. Now we are ready to set the fence.{nl}There are still many monsters so I hope you can help me to do this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003857	I am worried about the monsters, but I am also worried whether we could reach the amount.{nl}Strangely, the crops don't grow anymore.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003858	I appreciate you for making the fence.{nl}It will help the citizens of Klaipeda.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003859	Researcher Gares
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003860	The speed of the crops' growth is too bad.{nl}If we don't solve this, we may miss the right time to harvest.. could you help me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003861	As Uska ordered, Gitis is leading the construction.{nl}Instead of taking the danger of restoring the farm that was polluted on Medis Diena, they want to cultivate the forest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003862	Originally, that land belonged to the city so the owner of the farm didn't have to come.{nl}But since there's food problem, they made the farm in the name of the city.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003863	First, could you get me the samples of Sakmoli?{nl}That monster is plant-type so it must have received the same influence as the crops.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003864	This is our last chance.{nl}If we don't find out why the crops grow slowly, we may have to give up on this place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003865	So you've got them.{nl}Please wait a bit. We will get the result soon.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003866	So the monster suppressor was the problem.{nl}We were trying to prevent the number of monsters from increasing, but we almost ruined the crops as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003867	First, please retrieve the monster suppressor.{nl}If we have a weaker device, we would switch it, but we can't do anything about it now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003868	These were made for plant-type monsters so they would also influence the crops for sure.{nl}It was my mistake that I didn't think about it deeply.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003869	If it weren't you, we could have spoiled the harvest which we put in our enormous efforts in.{nl}They should grow well now right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003870	They are late. I mean, my colleagues who went to Ishigiti herb fields to defeat Gorgon.{nl}I don't wanna think that they were annihilated.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003871	Soldier Purse
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003872	Run! Gorgon is coming!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003873	I hope I was wrong.{nl}The monsters are going crazy..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003874	You defeated Gorgon youself?{nl}It is fortunate that my colleagues are safe, but I don't know what they did as soldiers..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003875	I will report to Uska that you saved this farm.{nl}Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003876	Help me! Gorgon is chasing after us!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003877	The person who is leading the mission at Dvasia Peak is Julian.{nl}Julian will really welcome me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003878	Thanks for your words.{nl}But it would be better to support Julian's squad at Dvasia Peak instead of this place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003879	I heard that the hardness and the elasticity of the wood sticks of Firent at Nepritas Cliffs is good.{nl}You can get the rope that was made from tieing those sticks from Red Pantos with spears. Please get me those first.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003880	At first, they were gathered to Uskis Arable Land and Spring Light Wood.{nl}But, not after a long time, they came to this place.{nl}They must be going after the honey.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003881	I think I can trust you more than any other revelators.{nl}If it's okay for you, could you look for Maras at Vilna Forest up there?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003882	If something suspicious appears again near the wood observatory tower, please hand it over to Ramar.{nl}I.. really don't know.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003883	You've gathered them a lot.{nl}I think this will be enough.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003884	Damage is bigger than the one that was caused no the seal on the Uskis Arable Land.{nl}The vicious energy is flowing more stronger.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003885	One thing I am worried about..{nl}That symbol has been destruced already so it may not be sealed perfectly.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003886	I believe that the goddesses would protect us.{nl}But, we will also do our best to repair the seal.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003887	I heard about the thorny forest before.{nl}That place was the forest before right? What should we do if our village turns like that?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003888	I can't endure monsters' violence anymore.{nl}We will protect the village from now on instead of relying on the disciples only.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003889	This didn't occur because Austeja goddess was absent right?{nl}However, if that's so, what should I do from now?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003890	I will give you the scroll of purification so use this to the demons and defeat them.{nl}The fluids of demons would let you obtain the solvent that is purified with the sacred energy of the great cathedral.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003891	You were able to avoid the curse, but you could not get away from the monsters.{nl}Maybe it was wrong to come here to do pilgrimage.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003892	You will pay for your intent of obtaining the revelation.{nl}Of course, you should obtain the fourth key of Maven as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003893	Finally, the last key.{nl}I've been waiting for this moment for hundreds of years..{nl}Somethig fills my mind.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003894	The last secret is in the small reception room.{nl}You should remember the order of the candles and their amount.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003895	The message of Maven
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003896	I am glad that the masterpiece of my life became the protective place of the revelation.{nl}But, you and my mission is not over yet.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003897	Savior. Please open all the doors of Pasara Altar.{nl}If you really wish to obtain the revelation of the goddesses, you will receive it at the end..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003898	My guide will end here.{nl}It was so fortunate that I was able to guide you well..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003899	I am going back to the goddesses.{nl}Please.. save the kingdom and the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003900	Let's extract the energy of the curse from the Penitence Route and make it appear.{nl}While I am concentrating, please activate all the altars of purification.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003901	The curse of Naktis makes people suffer just by looking at it.{nl}It makes people miserable.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003902	We have no other choice, but to find the solutions for each curse.{nl}It's like there are different treatments to different diseases.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003903	I want to go back to my hometown.{nl}Demons, curse.. I am tired of everything now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003904	When the next disciples come, I am planning to return to my hometown with them.{nl}It will be really good if I could return home while I am alive.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003905	There's not only the curse of Naktis in this world.{nl}The curse of Roxonado Petricifation is still effective these days after hundreds of years.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003906	The documents that are normal must still be present in the deeper side of the great cathedral..{nl}I am so sad that I wasn't able to see those.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003907	I would say that was the wisdom of Maven.{nl}Maven thought that the great cathedral would not be normal all the time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003908	So if we could just recharge the magical power, any kinds of magics will be okay.{nl}Even if that's a magical power from the demons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003909	Go to Veiniki altar when you recharge the sacred symbol of the spiritual power.{nl}The third key is waiting for you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003910	If you think you are ready, I will show you the true nature of the curse.{nl}If you can't eliminate it at once, it will make a bigger trouble.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003911	So now, the last verification is left.{nl}The scripture that will possess my spirit, Please open it in front of the altar of the revelation.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003912	The sacred artifacts that contain the words of the great bishops..{nl}I am so mad that they are placed like that in the filthy demons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003913	Fortunately, most of the artifacts seem okay.{nl}If I had the power little more, I would have purified the demons in the name of the goddesses right away.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003914	To prepare time like this, I've brought the marble that could search for the sacred energy.{nl}Look at the eyes of those demons.{nl}You may be in trouble, since they will run towards the artifacts as they see them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003915	We've been sent from the congregation to investigate the curse of Naktis.{nl}We should first find the documents that were scattered, but the problem is those demons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003916	The lost documents all contain important contents in them.{nl}I want to bring all of them, but we should first remove the curse.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003917	It was a big help.{nl}When I treat the people who are cursed, I will tell them your name.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003918	I made a stupid mistake.{nl}I lost my concentration for a moment and I found out that I lost the report that I should send to Adel.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003919	I am keep looking around, but I am thinking that it may be due to the demons.{nl}If you are okay, can you help me to look for the reports?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003920	Ah! This is it.{nl}If you get a chance to go to the main church, please hand it over to Adel.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003921	We need a lot of solvent in order to make the medicine that will remove the curse of Naktis.{nl}But as you can see, we can't get the solvent at the moment.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003922	But, there is still a way.{nl}If you could help me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003923	I was confident in making medicines so I thought I will be successful.{nl}I think I overestimated my skill.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003924	Thanks.{nl}The purity is little lacking.. but, if we refine it one more time, it will be useful.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003925	You are late. Maven's secret is being attacked.{nl}If you lost the sacred symbol of the spiritual energy, you will never able to get the third key.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003926	I regret that I could not do anything.{nl}We should get the sacred symbol of the spiritual power fast.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003927	It is so fortunate that the sacred symbol of the spiritual power is okay. {nl}But, I can't sense the magical power anymore in it due to the passage of long time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003928	Defeat the demons nearby using the sacred symbol of the spiritual power.{nl}You can collect the magical power that is needed to obtain the third key.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003929	To remove the curse of Naktis, I am making a medicine which would resist against the vicious energy. {nl}But, it's hard to guarantee the effects of it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003930	If you are okay, can you check the effects of the medicine?{nl}Ah, I don't mean to try it yourself. I am telling you to try on the demons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003931	This is the medicine to pull out the vicious energy from the body.{nl}But, it could cause interal injuries.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003932	It's either ineffective or.. actually it seems okay.{nl}It even explodes?{nl}Then we should work on it little more.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003933	The number of the keys that remains in Maven are two.{nl}You can't solve the secret with the condition of the cathedral at the moment with one of those keys.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003934	We have only one method.. using the demons.{nl}I will tell you about the plan slowly, there's some things to find first.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003935	There's an old document here that contains the method to disguise as a demon in this sanctuary.{nl}You should use that to get the key without bleeding at all.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003936	You found it. Show me.{nl}Where was the clause..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003937	The way to produce it is simple. But you may have to put your efforts.{nl}First get some clothes from the subordinates of Naktis.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003938	Using the demons.. The goddesses may turn their heads away.{nl}But, if this is the best method, I will do it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003939	That will be enough.{nl}Now use the clothes to complete the scroll.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003940	In this manual, it says that you can complete the scroll to transform into a demon at the altar of intelligence.{nl}Luckily, there's an altar of intelligence at Laukti Cliffs.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003941	That's the passion of the disciples who tried to protect the kingdom from the evils. {nl}It continued on for hundreds of years until today.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003942	So the demons went to the altar of Gaule without any complaints?{nl}Now follow them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003943	I am making the medicine quickly to heal one of the pilgrims who is cursed.{nl}I am almost finished, but it's so hard to get the thistle.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003944	The medicine has the property of pushing out the vicious energy itself so they won't consume it easily.{nl}I am thinking about putting the medicine into the meats. Could you help us?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003945	I hope this method would be effective.{nl}It will save a lot of people.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003946	The smell is bad so you will be able to deceive them.{nl}Please wait a minute. I will put the medicine into the meats.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003947	Any meat will be okay. Even the meats from the monsters nearby.{nl}Okay then I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003948	It's completed.{nl}The medicine should work well.. Can you pass this meat to the pilgrim down there?{nl}{nl}You should continue to feed him until he is satisfied.{nl}I mean all the meats you've obtained. 20 lumps in total right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003949	So the pilgrim ate the meat?{nl}Ah.. still not yet?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003950	So the medicine worked well?{nl}Really.. it is so fortunatel. Thanks for helping me.{nl}I will tell about this recipe to the other disciples as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003951	I can sense the other kinds of the curse. The curse that is diffrent from the curse of Naktis.{nl}The true nature of it should be present somewhere, but it's so hard for me to find it alone.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003952	We've found it!{nl}Now we will eliminate the true nature.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003953	My friend is strange. {nl}He is not breathing and his face looks pale. His heart also doesn't beat anymore.{nl}Did he already leave to the goddesses? Dalus, please open your eyes..

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003958	Revalator. I want to bury Dalus under the Ramivi Cliffs where he can see his hometown.{nl}But there are so many monsters there. Please get rid of them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003959	First, it will be better to find the documents from the Sanctuary.{nl}I remember that the document that contains the method of disguising as a demon should be somewhere.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003960	Okay. Use this scroll to lure the demons to the Gaule Altar.{nl}I don't know what would occur.. you will see when you wait.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003961	There are dangerous demons that lure the disciples and lead them to deaths.{nl}They look like the secret of Maven.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003964	So the five keys are all collected.{nl}Go to Pasara Altar. The secrets would lead you to the hidden room.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003965	Are you the revelator of the goddesses or the one who belongs to the mighty power of the darkness?{nl}The vicious darkness can not cross here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003966	You've proven yourself that you are the revelator of the goddesses.{nl}You may enter the room where the revelation is located.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003970	You must have traveled various places in the kingdom.{nl}I am sorry, but do you know anything about the mysterious girl?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003971	The girl left these trees before Medis Diena.{nl}My master asked me to find about the trees, but I knew nothing about them..{nl}I want to get help from you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003972	We should find out if they just imply some kind of a symbol or they are endowed with some kind of power.{nl}Please first collect the leaves of Ellum at the neglected grape fields.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003973	She is a girl with the mysterious energy.{nl}From long time ago, she travelled across the kingdom and left many forecasts and miracles.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003974	Recently, we saw a similar looking girl at the crystal mine. {nl}But, strangely, she wasn't able to say anything.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003975	Ellums are the monsters that were created in mass after Medis Diena.{nl}If the trees here are endowed with some kind of power, the leaves of Ellum should react to them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003976	This will be enough. {nl}We will concentrate temporarily.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003977	Revelator, this is amazing!{nl}When we endowed the power of of the trees to the leaves of the monsters that you brought, they waned right away.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003978	Okay if that's so.. Please obtain two lumps of samples of land that is polluted with the vicious energy.{nl}I want to know more about the power of the trees.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003979	In fact, the vicious energy was purified by the power of humans.{nl}But, if the power of the trees are true.. they will be purified by planting them on the several places.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003980	So you brought them.{nl}I just finished the preparation of the purification ritual.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003981	I will see the responses of this sample like the leaves.{nl}I hope it goes well.. Please see it yourself Revelator!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003982	Oh my god, please look at this. The ritual was successful.{nl}The master would purify everything at once with these trees.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003983	Until the master comes back, I am going to do some base work for the large scale purification.{nl}Can you collect the five bottles of Tanus fluids from the Kvie farm?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003984	Thanks for helping me.{nl}Anyways, the girl who left the trees.. what is her identity?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003985	These trees are so mysterious.{nl}It's like the revelator brought the clues of purification.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003986	You've done enough.{nl}I should tell Druid Master that you've been a great help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003987	Ah, I have one more thing to request to you lastly.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003988	This is the box that we discovered with the trees.{nl}If you get a chance to go to Shaton farm, please hand it over to Martineck.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003989	He likes to interfere with others' lives so he may have involved in some kind of matter.{nl}Maybe, we should ask the other people about the whereabout of him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003990	The Farm Supervisor Dorun
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003991	This is the private land of Shaton. {nl}Even a revelator should not interfere here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003992	Farmer Max
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003993	Wheat farming is possible here unlike Shaton Farm.{nl}We were able to harvest the last farming... but...{nl}I am worried about the next farming.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003994	Farmer Daahsi
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003995	Damn. I guess we should leave this place.{nl}We were able to harvest and live due to the care of Jina Green, but it's too hard now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003996	Monsters are the bigger problem we have at the moment besides failing harvesting due to vicious energy.{nl}If you could move out the monsters, then we may be able to endure little more.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003997	We may be able to stand until the harvest season.{nl}But, the land is keep getting polluted so one day it may turn into like the thorny forest.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003998	I received the unexpected help from you.{nl}You and the druids are all trying hard so I can't just fall down like this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_003999	We were lucky though. Do you know Druid Master?{nl}Jina Green, the owner of this garden.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004000	She lent me the land without asking for any consideration to me after I lost my hometown due to Medis Diena.{nl}But, what should I do now. Harvesting is becoming ineffective, and the number of monster is increasing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004001	I was so thankful until now, but I can't let the families starve..{nl}If the vicious energy of the garden does not get removed, we have no choice, but to leave.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004002	Did you feel something strange while you were coming here?{nl}I mean dandelions. They are big compared to the ones in other places.. and they are quite threatening.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004003	We should pull them out when they are sprouts, otherwise they would cover the whole garden.{nl}But due to the monsters, we can't continue our work.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004004	It may be a lethargic excuse.{nl}We lost our hometown and we can't farm on the land that we hardly obtained.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004005	I should help you somehow since you helped me alot.{nl}I will be pay attention from now on. I won't lost to those monsters.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004007	This is my hometown that I returned after a long time and it has changed a lot.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004009	I want Druids to drive the monsters out, but they are only looking at the tree.{nl}I am so mad. Who is that girl anyways. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004010	Hey. You, revelator. Please help me instead of just looking at me.{nl}I want you to drive out the monsters that are on my fields.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004011	The girl that the druids are talking about.{nl}I don't know about the trees, but I think they will bring the disaster.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004012	I can't do the farming due to the vicious energy and also those monsters..{nl}I've been farming here for a long time, but since that girl came here and left, we have so many troubles.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004013	I know that I've lived here for my whole life, but those young men should not lie.{nl}Are you telling me the trees or the girl would be a help? That's nonsense.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004014	Thanks, really.{nl}You are way better off than those useless Druids there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004015	I would have driven out all druids if it weren't Jina Green.{nl}When I was running away from the monsters last time, they saved me, but they don't look at me after that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004016	Okay, good. Please find my luggages.{nl}I was so busy at then so I forgot everything about the luggages.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004025	That's so thankful.{nl}First, please get me the eggs of the monsters first. I have something to check.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004026	There are places that need me so I feel very thankful. {nl}But, my stamina is not like before.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004027	Well done.{nl}With this, we would be able to know how much the vicious energy has accumulated so far.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004028	That's strange. I thought I should give up on this place, but some other energies are mixed together.{nl}To know this, we need something that received the energy of the ground strongly. Could you help me a bit?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004029	Please take a look at the roots of grapevine closely at the Abarza grape farm.{nl}The other monsters' eggs must be adjacent to them. I want you to bring me about three of them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004030	Please be careful since you may get hurt when you touch the egg houses.{nl}It is a good habit to be always be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004031	Good. The sacred energy is slowly spreading in the ground.{nl}Since you helped me, we don't have to give up on this garden.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004032	But, that energy is too weak and it is from the kind that I barely knows.{nl}Maybe the druids should know about it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004033	The private officer of Shaton Family, Hartman
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004034	I will help you so please move out before I scold you!

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004036	If that's so, come back after defeating those Drakes.{nl}Ah, and don't forget to bring me the evidences. I've got something to report.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004037	This place is the private farm of Shaton family.{nl}No one can enter except for tenant farmers and the people who are permitted to enter.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004038	If you are gonna keep saying non-senses such as pollution, you better move outta here fasst.{nl}Or.. there is another way to get the permission from me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004039	If you receive something, then you shuld also give up something.{nl}You thought you would be able to enter without any charges here?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004040	Very well indeed. From now on, you would be able to enter the farm whenever you want.{nl}But, you should do something about my subordinates though.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004041	Are you looking for Druid? I know where he is. {nl}The soldiers levied the tax, but it's not enough.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004042	I am sure that he hid it away, but I don't know where it is.{nl}The brown pocket with the grains in it. If you understood it, come fast.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004043	It's going to take more time to look for Druid if you take more and more time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004044	Well done. Well done.{nl}The Druid that you are looking for, He actually came here before.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004045	He said lots of things about the labor conditions of the farmers so I moved him out with some excuse.{nl}After, I told him that the farmers at the workspace and the brewery are not returning, he disappeared fast.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004046	Well, it's not a lie so that shouldn't be a problem.{nl}Go to Neshiba intersections.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004047	I was acting kindly to Druid because of the farm located at the next side.{nl}But, if you annoy me, remember that you will be expelled from here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004048	Druid Martineck
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004049	You have something for me?{nl}Wait a bit. You came at the right time. I have to first save these people.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004052	I will listen your story later slowly.{nl}I will give you the antidote first so please feed the cursed ones with the antidote.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004053	This is just an emergency treatment so I should stay here to make the medicine.{nl}The locations that are indicated on the report are Jireta brewery and Gausa workplace. Please hurry up!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004054	Shaton farm looks peaceful when you just look at it.{nl}But, the land is polluted with the vicious energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004055	I know that the purification is important, but if we don't save the cursed farmers right away, we may lose our lives.{nl}As a Druid, how can I move those people out?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004056	Please hurry. {nl}They will not die right away, but they must be suffering a lot.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004057	It's good that you came at the right time because we almost got into a trouble.{nl}By the way, did you need anything from me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004058	Ah, so Ellie finally found the true nature of the trees.{nl}The seeds of the trees are in this box.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004059	But, since these seeds are too old, we need to endow them with the power of the nature.{nl}Can you help me a bit?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004060	I will get some power from the frogs with the wings.{nl}Make them exhausted and bring them with this stick.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004061	These are the seeds that were discovered with the tree that the mysterious girl had left.{nl}And we also found out that these seeds are those of the trees.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004062	But, since no one knew about the true identity of the trees, we never thought about planting them.{nl}However, I will use these seeds to engage in the massive scale purification.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004063	It is not a hard task for the druid to revive the old seeds.{nl}Of course, it will be important to look for the place to plant them first.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004064	The monster must be alive.{nl}We could use the power only if when it's alive.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004065	Well done. {nl}When we maintain the moist environment, they will become healthy seeds.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004066	However, the areas near here are polluted with the vicious energy too much, so we would need a specific type of water.{nl}The water at the well of Gausa workplace may work though..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004067	Take this. This is the plate that was used in the ritual ceremony of the Druids.{nl}It will purify the bad energy a bit.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004068	The stream near here is too polluted.{nl}The water at the well of Gausa workplace should be okay since they are located far below underground.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004069	It's so fortunate to see you are okay. {nl}Let's start the ritual soon.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004070	Okay then let's get started. {nl}It is a simple ritual so it should end soon.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004071	So you came.{nl}I guess I didn't think too deeply.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004072	The soldier at the farm, Gedson
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004073	Even if you are the revelator, this is a private land. {nl}Go out if you don't have any business here!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004074	If that's so, come back after defeating Cist up there.{nl}After seeing how you behave, I will think about whether I would just let it go or not.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004075	I can't do this anymore.{nl}This place is polluted with the vicious energy and they are not even paying me a lot.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004076	Good. I like it a lot.{nl}But, I don't meat to let it go yet. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004077	The one who makes me most annoyed is Drake.{nl}He is violent and looks disgusting. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004078	Come back after defeating the drake at Ishicla farming road. {nl}I won't say anything if you could do that for me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004079	Those monsters are going well even if the vicious energy and the poison are all around the place.{nl}This world is such an unfair place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004080	As I promised, I won't say anything for your entrance into the farm before.{nl}But, just up to my jurisdiction. Behave yourself well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004081	The woman at the far, Charlotte
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004082	I don't wanna see Shaton family and those soldiers.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004085	Lots of grapes were polluted due to the vicious energy.{nl}If it continues like this, people will start to die.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004086	Please spray the herbicide on the grape vines without those soldiers knowing about it.{nl}If they find out that the grapes are not growing, Shaton might change his mind.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004087	When was it.. I think it was way before Medis Diena.{nl}The girl in worn out clothes told us that the disaster would come with the awkward accent and the gestures.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004088	And not after long, Medis Diena came.{nl}As the girl said. I personally think the polluted grapes are also the part of the disaster.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004089	They want to harvest even those..{nl}I am sure that the owner of the farm, Shaton is crazy. I am surprised to see how the person could change that much even if he lost his son.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004090	Some forest is covered with the thorny trees?{nl}I like the grapes, but the grapes polluted with the vicious energy.. Isn't it horrible?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004091	Thanks. I undertand he lost his son, but..{nl}I am sure that he went crazy after that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004092	Damn!{nl}Chupakabras came after smelling the polluted grape vines dried to their deathes.{nl}What should we do?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004093	If you go near the bushes, the hidden monsters may suddenly appear.{nl}I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004094	I am more relieved now.{nl}Thanks. Now, It will be good if Shaton regains his conciousness.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004100	The soldiers want bribes and the supervisor doesn't care even if anything happens to us.{nl}And Shaton takes the taxes in the amount that would barely keep us alive.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150323_004101	If they don't listen to them, I am sure that they will ask for more bribes.{nl}Instead of starving to deathes, they are risking their lives. The times were much better when the son was the owner.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005633	Strange. Isn't it? How come the food gets spoiled whenever I cross there.{nl}Is it because of the smoke there?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005634	How would I know about it. {nl}If you are going back to my brother, please get rid of those strange things. I can't do it since I am scared.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005635	If they are getting spoiled due to the smoke, what is that anyways..{nl}It's not good for health right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005636	I actually suspected those round things that are making the smoke.{nl}But they were keep saying it was created by the baron, so how would I know about it who only used to harvest.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005637	So did the smoke go away?{nl}It is the first time I am seeing that kind of thing.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005638	Hello.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005643	Are you the revelator? {nl}I don't care about that, I am a bit busy right now so could you help my task?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005644	There are some magic fields around here that we put after receiving the order of Areluno Baron.{nl}The magic field blocks the strange energy in this region and supplies the magical power onto this generator.{nl}But, since the power of the magic field is weak, we need to enhance it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005645	{nl}The true revelator would find the way to enhance the magic field just by looking at it.{nl}Take the bottles since you may need them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005646	The power generator works by using the grains that are piled up at the storage over there.{nl}That's why I needed them a lot.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005647	{nl}The tenants are cooperating with us without any resistance.{nl}.. Anyways, I am worried since that storage gets attacked by the monsters frequently these days.{nl}I guess that's not strange since we piled up the grains like that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005648	I can only say it's the power generator that helps the important gate which connects the two places to be stayed open.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005650	What is that? Is that the head part of the sculpture? Give it to me. I got something to check.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005658	This land is too infertile and the monsters also took all the seeds.{nl}Can you find the seeds that the monsters took away from you?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005659	The amount of the seeds that you retrieved is not enough.{nl}I am sorry, but can you get me some more?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005660	I put them well in the pockets.{nl}I think the monsters who took them ran away to Tuvora Highway.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005661	If I ask the baron to give me the seeds again, he may hit me. {nl}The soldiers can't say anything to the baron as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005662	Oh, yes. This is it.{nl}But, not everything has returned.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005663	Now we have some seeds. {nl}Thank you so much.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005670	We can make lots of weapons with the leather and the stonese.{nl}Right now, we don't have enough leather.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005673	{nl}My grandmother taught me this method.{nl}It is the method to obtain some specific substancees from the things nearby.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005674	The farming tools are used to crave the land so they can be also used as weapons.{nl}But, we definitely need the cooperation from the tenant famers..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005675	Please extract some Nioles from there.{nl}Niole is a thankful flower.{nl}You can make soups with the grains and they can also be used as herbs.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005685	There's a magic field at the entrance of Tarvas.{nl}You should break that first.{nl}But the monsters always disturb it..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005686	Now we are almost done!{nl}Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005687	It seems that the pieces that he gave to me belong to the statue of the goddess.{nl}This must be.. the trace of those barons manipulating something on this ground and breaking it afterwards.{nl}You who collected these..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005688	I am collecting the traces here.{nl}I can't tell you in details, but I am preparing for something big.{nl}To do that, I need to persuade the tenant farmers.{nl}So I am collecting those.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005689	There's a magic field before you reach Ramus Intersection.{nl}And the smoke is coming up from the ground.{nl}That's called the strange energy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005691	Monsters fall into the eternal sleep.. dying..{nl}The monsters die due to the energy that is coming out from there..{nl}The monsters are tiresome and vicious.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005692	{nl}The monsters fall into the eternal sleep due to that energy, that proves that the energy is not bad.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005693	The amount of the crops after harvesting reduced a lot from some point of time in the past.{nl}Even if we care a lot, the crops wither easily.{nl}I think it may be due to the magic field that the barons created on this land.{nl}Could you help me out?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005694	{nl}That's why the amount of the crops was reduced.{nl}I am trying to find the reason for it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005695	This magic field has some kind of protective barrier so it's not easy to break it.{nl}So I am trying to light it up.{nl}To break the shield, I should maintain the flame.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005696	{nl}Should we kill those orange Dandells and throw kindlings on them?{nl}Try it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005697	The barons are pludering a lot these days and the magic fields like that have been created a lot across this region. Some of them are less shiny.{nl}Anyways, you get hurt from the ones that shine more so it's hard to eliminate them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005698	You came at the right time. I connected the pieces with some sticky stuff.{nl}.. As I expected. This is the statue of the goddess.{nl}I could only glue them like this with my skill.. It will break again if I don't do it well.{nl}I am sorry that I just glued them like this..

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005700	Oh really?{nl}Very well done!{nl}Too bad about the statue.. but the goddesses would forgive this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005701	There's a uncompleted seal magic field down there.{nl}The seal is not complete yet so the strange energy is coming out from it, but the problem is that it doesn't look like that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005702	{nl}It is suspicious.{nl}I have to connect these pieces, so can you find out more about the energy?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005703	To accomplish a big task..{nl}You should first collect the clues.{nl}You can only persuade the tenant farmers with them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005704	The crops aren't growing.. There aren't anything to eat..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005705	The enhancement of the magic field and the magical power supply are closely related to each other.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005706	We are keep going to do the task to find ours and let the truth spreads.{nl}But, your task will end here.{nl}You can go on your way.{nl}I really thank you for helping us this far.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005708	Then, I will go into your small pocket.{nl}Don't forget. Trust no one.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005709	The goddess wants you to eliminate all demons in the prison.{nl}The demons became unforgivable creatures after the day of the divine tree.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005710	But, since the demons are coming through the space of the metastasis, it's not going to be easy.{nl}You should resist the demons that are trying to free the demon lord, Blut.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005711	This place is not the world of humans or the demons' world, but it is another isolated place.{nl}We've locked the demons in this prison that are not helpful in this world.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005712	It was like that before Medis Diena, but the circumstances have changed a lot.{nl}We now have reasons to destroy the demons. They caused Medis Diena.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005713	But, it's not easy since the space of metastasis is keep enlarging.{nl}The demons are keep coming through the space of the metastasis.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005714	Lots of demons are gathering at Rituala to paricipate the ritual to free Bluts.{nl}Please first defeat them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005715	The subordinates of the demon lord, Blut are trying to escape from here by breaking the power of the barrier.{nl}}Haubuck's help will be useful this time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005716	Well done. You've blocked the most emergent thing.{nl}Now it the time to block the power of the demon lord, Blut.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005717	Finally I met the one whom my spirit was looking for.{nl}I am the demon lord, Haubuck. I have a suggetion to you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005718	Please help me to get a part of my spirit.{nl}The place where the goddess of the night star, Vakarine exists.. It will be an interesting suggestion to you.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005720	Strange.{nl}Unlike other humans, I can't possess your body.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005721	We have no other choice. Take my seal piece and go in there.{nl}I will guide you from there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005722	Now, Gidrone is holding Blut.{nl}But, I don't know how much we can endure by ourselves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005723	We should somehow reduce the influence of the demon lord, Blut.{nl}Please take the secreting gland of Blut away from Blut's allies at Byeaulleo Hideout.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005724	He is the head of the demons that are locked in this district.{nl}They are trying to control this prison somehow and looking for chances to escape from here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005725	Actually, Blut told the others proudly that Haubuck turned out like that because of him.{nl}There were followers to the demons that were increasing their influence and Haubuck was leading all that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005726	Blut thought that Haubuck was being presumptuous so he told about it to Giltine.{nl}That's why he got ripped off by Helgasercle.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005727	Vakarine and the other Kupols are also having hard time.{nl}Let's finish our task here fast and go to a different district to help.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005728	It will be a great help to Gidrone.{nl}I will eliminate this. Blut would feel like that he lost his feelers.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005729	To defeat the demon lord, Blut completely, our power is not enough.{nl}I didn't want to do this, but let's try getting some help from Haubuck.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005730	There's something which Blut accumulated the power in at the altar in the concentrated control district.{nl}Only demons could control it, but we have Haubuck.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005731	When Haubuck absorbs that power, please go help Gidrone right away.{nl}To Nujicalti Hall. Hurry. We don't have enough time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005732	We are the attendants who are serving the goddesses.{nl}Our work differs depending on which goddess we serve.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005733	Our original task was to manage and supervise the prison.{nl}Now, with Vakarine's control, our task is to close the space of the metastasis and defeat the demons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005734	The power of the demons reject the power of the goddesses.{nl}This role completely depends on Haubuck.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005735	So you are the one who Vakarine mentioned.{nl}Good. The goddess will lead the everything.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005736	I've locked Blut in the barrier of the prison, but he won't endure there for long time.{nl}We should attack all at once. Are you ready?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005737	If we weren't able to defeat Blut here, Vakarine may have fallen down together.{nl}Hurry to the 2nd district. Medeina is waiting there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005738	Damn. The demons that lost their leader, Blut is trying to escape to the outer world.{nl}If they succeed on breaking the weak part of the barrier, a catastrophe would result.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005739	The area where the influence of the goddesses could reach is getting smaller.{nl}We should somehow help out the goddesses..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005740	Well done.{nl}If the demons come out to the outer world, a catastrophe would result.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005741	The human expedition team actually came here.{nl}But, unfortunately, they all died.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005742	I want to calm their spirits by finding their belongings.{nl}But, it's not easy since the demons are carrying them like their booties.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005743	Humans should not come here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005744	Thanks. {nl}I hope there are no more sacrifices like this..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005745	Kupol Medeina
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005746	We are in a trouble.{nl}The barrier of the goddess is breaking due to the mighty power of the demon lord, Nuaele.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005747	Aldona went to face against Nuaele since he wants to resist some more.{nl}If you could reduce the mighty power of Nualele a bit.. It will help Aldona a lot!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005748	The barrier of the goddess is like a great wall surrounding this prison.{nl}It will block the demons coming into the prison or escaping from here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005749	The space of the metastasis started to be created on the barrier due to the day of the divine tree.{nl}Vakarine is having hard time since she should maintain the barrier and face the demons at the same time.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005750	Please hurry to the 1st district before the demons meet Nuaele. {nl}I want you to eliminate them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005751	Goddesses.{nl}Please protect Aldona..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005752	Well done.{nl}Since you've defeated many demons and their power will be reduce a lot.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005753	Nuaele is luring his subordinates and spreading his influence with the pieces of the seal of Haubuck.{nl}Haubuck should feel something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005754	There are more methods to increase the power of Haubuck using that.{nl}Haubuck would also want that.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005755	Nuaele was in fact not that strong demon lord.{nl}But, after obtaining the seal piece of Haubuck, he spreaded his influence at a astonishingly fast pace.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005756	After losing his master, Haubuck's subordinates started to follow him who has the piece of the seal.{nl}They are like betrayers to Haubuck.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005757	Haubuck is retriving his manes that he gave to his subordinates as a symbol of their faithfulness.{nl}Now, go to the 2nd isolated area. They must be gathered there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005758	The subordinates of Haubuck are still following Nuaele as if he is Haubuck.{nl}But, if Haubuck retrieves his manes, they will know who is their true master.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005759	Now, the demon lord, Nuaele would know it.{nl}In order to escapse from this prison, he should not only rely on his subordinates.{nl}But, its too late now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005760	By the way, Nuaele's behavior is somewhat strange.{nl}In fact, with the power that he accumulated secretly for a long time, he may just break the barrier and go out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005761	But, for us, we are waiting for someone that we don't know. {nl}I guess we should interrogate the subordinates of Nuaele.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005762	I will give you the marbles that I received from the goddess.{nl}We, Kupols can't do it, but since Haubuck is a demon, he would be able to read our mind.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005763	When the power of the goddesses get weak, the mighty power of us, Kupols also get weak.{nl}Furthermore, trying to disturb the minds of the demons, it's impossible.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005764	He was thinking about changing the prison into his demonic world from the first place.{nl}If this place falls under the hands of him, even Ausrine can't do anything.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005765	Since we've found the objective of Nuaele, let's get moving fast.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005766	How about we first attack * monster at the 4th isolated area?{nl}If we could defeat it, it's like we are defeating one of the strongest weapons of Nuaele.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005767	Haubuck was once the strong demon lord who led the biggest herd.{nl}After he was sealed, I thought no one as strong as him would appear again.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005768	But, Nuaele is imitating as if he is Haubuck with the piece of the seal.{nl}He became the strongest demon lord at least in this place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005769	You will see the end of someone who tried to use other's power instead of using his power.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150401_005770	He was in fact the subordinate of Haubuck. Haubuck won't need him anymore.{nl}After Haubuck was sealed, he ran to Nuaele and handed over the seal piece to him.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006159	I am the secretary of the farm owner, Baron Allerno. {nl}Sir Allerno wants your help in purifying this land.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006160	Sir Allerno hired wizards to build a laboratory for purifying the farm. {nl}He gave the whole farm for it. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006161	Everyone is tired because of the strange aura. {nl}But they say that this aura will disappear when the device is complete so we'll be fine soon. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006162	The work is simple. {nl}All workers, including me, are feeling very exhausted because of the strange aura. {nl}Please check if it is also affecting the the crops nearby the abandoned farm.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006163	Still not yet? {nl}Baron Allerno's expecting a lot from the Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006164	There is a strange aura right? {nl}But it's not affecting the crops.. That's different from Limas' story.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006165	Anyway, the strange aura is surely there so we should get rid of that. {nl}If we just perfrom the ritual that Limas told us.. Sorry, I fell a bit dizzy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006166	Oh I'm causing such trouble.. Thank you. {nl}You just have to make a magic circle with the firewood I give you and burn the Shaman doll on top of it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006167	I want to sit and rest. {nl}But I can't do that as a secretary.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006168	"The crops died when you did what you were told to do? {nl}It's okay. I was told that the bad aura within the crops will go away like that. {nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006171	Welcome to this farm. {nl}The Baron is deeply worried about contamination fo the farm so allow me to welcome you for him.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006172	Worries? Ah, the spells are not gathered in the power because of the strange aura. {nl}We tried laying the magic circle in every test area but the magic circles are weaker than I thought.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006173	Oh, this is a very important device. {nl}The portal and the power to retain it.. Oops, forget about this one. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006174	Anyway, it's something needed to remove the strange aura in this land. {nl}I'm talking about purification. Isn't it such a problem.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006175	Well, how is it going?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006176	Thank you. Check the magic circle in the test area first. {nl}If you come across a weird crystal, it's a working magic circle so you just have to destroy the crytal only.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006177	But if there is no crystal, then it mean there is a problem. {nl}You just have to gather the evil force of monsters in this bottle and bury it near the magic circle.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006178	Great. {nl}But this isn't the only problem.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006179	That power device works with power of nature. {nl}But the monsters area preying on that warehouse and it's become a problem.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006180	Luckily, the tenant farmers are cooperative. {nl}But it's a pain that the mosnters are preying on that warefhouse.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006181	The power source needs enery of nature and what do you think can be used right away? {nl}The crops in the warehouse, that is. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006182	Dont' worry. We'll have a good harvest if we solve the contamination problem. {nl}And if we retain that door.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006183	It's the old food supplies warehouse site. {nl}Afterall, there's a pile of crops so the monster could prey on it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006184	I can't leave this place because I have to guard it. {nl}But I can't make the Baron go himself eighter.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006185	Now we can have some peace for a while. {nl}We just have to keep that door.. Hmm, anyway, nevermind.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006186	Wait that.. seems like a familiar statue? {nl}Sorry but can I take a look?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006187	Ah, right. I forgot about the magic circles in Shtishka farm road. {nl}Take this and try spraying it. I've made it before. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006188	I had a hard time gathering it from the monsters and refining it. {nl}Don't worry. Even evil auras can be useful on how you handle it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006189	Refined liquid with omnious feels. {nl}Strengthening the magic circle with this, sounds suspicous but let's give it a try.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006190	This is a big problem. Where did it go with the food? {nl}Hey, I'm sorry but can you find me the Mentiken? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006191	Mentiken? Don't think weird things about it. It's a monster. {nl}The Baron needs it so I'm looking after it. Things like giving it food. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006192	Don't ask where it's needed. {nl}It's all for the farm.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006193	It might be near the brewery. I will look around that area. {nl}If you find it, throw this meat to lure it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006194	Baron Secretary Venius
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006195	This is tough. {nl}Many might be killed..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006196	Hmm? You killed it because it tried to eat people? {nl}Ah.. Well then, nevermind. I will report it to the Baron.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006197	Even in the rural area like this, we have hear about you. {nl}We are preparing to fight against the plunder and arrogance of the baron. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006198	It will be a big support if you can help our weapon supplies.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006199	I just happened to take the lead like this. {nl}I'm just a tenant farmer who could not stand the baron's arrogance anymore.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006200	The plunder and arrogance is a problem but what make us more angry is that he is fooling us in disguise of purification. {nl}All he does is a disgrace to the Goddess' name.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006201	Please get some wood sticks from the wooden fences nearby. {nl}We're going to make weapons.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006202	We don't know how much we can fight the baron's guards. {nl}But the fight itself is enough to have its meaning.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006203	This will be about enough. {nl}I will tell you later on but if what I think is right, the Baron betrayed the Goddess.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006204	There are magic circles around the that suppress the strange aura because of the Baron's orders. {nl}But that was a lie. The baron is not interested in purification. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006205	Anyway, please help us get leather for making weapons. {nl}You can get it from the monsters nearby.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006206	There are strange auras speard all over the farm.{nl}The baron said it is dangerous and ordered to make magic circles around to suppress it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006207	But nobody was damaged by the strange aura. {nl}It's not even funny. The crops rather grew well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006208	We won't just standy by anymore.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006209	That will be enough. Thank you. {nl}To be honest, I don't care what the baron wants. {nl}But..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006210	I mean even if what the baron wants really is purification. {nl}With my colleagues gone, it's nonsense that I have to bear the expensive farm rent fees.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006211	That's what I think. Now.. I have to collect poison. {nl}It will be useful around.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006212	Not being affirmative is a big weakness. {nl}I think something is hidden in the aqueduct restriced area though.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006213	He's a greedy old man so there must be something. I'm sure about it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006214	Place the poison pot, lure the monster to it, then kill it. {nl}Bring it to me when enough is collected.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006215	I'm sorry for asking something like this. {nl}But please feel pity for us and help us out a little more.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006216	I'm thinking about borrowing farm tools from farmers nearby for the lacking weapons. {nl}You are a famour revelator so it will be fairly easy for you to borrow the tools.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006217	If you pursuade them with the letter I give you, they will understand.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006218	This much.. Thank you very much. {nl}Oh, if you have time, I hope you can help my collagues as well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006219	I am Horacius' colleague. I am in charge of the food supplies. {nl}The promised day is coming but we don't have enough manpower. Can you help us?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006220	We will make it with Horacius. {nl}Everyone is exhauted from the unreasonable farm rent fees.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006221	Now that the Baron secretary who used to protect us is gone.. {nl}We only have our teo hands to trust.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006222	Then please get the Nioles with roots from Riaum knoll. {nl}We can use it with potatos to make soup and it is also used as medicine.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006223	Even if the baron did something right, it's all for him to live. {nl}No one can point their finger at us.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006224	And.. dried foods are better to keep for a long period. {nl}The jerkeys especially keeps you full even with little intake so I'm trying to gather as much as I can.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006225	The farm rent fees have become a burden recently. {nl}He also had weird reasons to collect them more often. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006226	My colleague began now showing up one day. {nl}From then on, the things baron say about purificaiton and stuff all seems like a life. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006227	I believe all of these have something to do with the baron. {nl}I want to find out what it is. Even if I have to sort to violence. {nl}And it was Horacius who thought the same with me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006228	You need to get edible meat from the monsters nearby. {nl}If we have the meat, you just have to place it in the drier.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006229	The point is to get edible meat from the monsters. {nl}Most of them are tough and fishy.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006230	Thank you very much. {nl}We need to be full to fight well.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006231	Lastly.. The problem is that the monsters frequently prey on the food storage house. {nl}There is a fella guarding that place but it's constanly exposed to danger.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006232	The Food Storage is in Vinoga Brewery Site. {nl}Do you think it's already late?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006233	The warehouse keeper told me to thank you for him. {nl}Oh, if you see my colleagues asking for help, please help them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006234	Are you the revelator? {nl}I do hear the news even out here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006235	I'm helping Horacius remove the magic circles of the baron. {nl}If it's alright, can you help me?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006236	The baron said the strange aura is dangerous and told us not to go near it. {nl}But I don't think so.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006237	It was similar to the aura I felt from the giant Goddess Zemyna Statue in Fedimian. {nl}It's like I wonder if it is actually purifying the land instead.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006238	Let's see. Now there around 3 left. {nl}Darvas Entrance, Padeka Altar, and the Fallow Land.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006239	The people in this farm used to pray to Goddess Zemyna from Padeka Altar. {nl}But after the baron made magic circles, the monsters took the place instead.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006240	I can only assume that the monsters were drawn to the magic circle. {nl}The magic circle is suppressing the divine power of the altar..? or something.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006241	It's a monster called Kirmeleech. {nl}Don't forget to remove the magic circle after defeating the monster.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006242	It's been a while since we've offered prayers because of Kirmeleech. {nl}What if the Goddess is angry?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006243	Good job. {nl}Now we can pray again to Goddess Zemyna.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006244	The magic circle in Fallow Land has protective barriers so it's difficult to destroy it right away. {nl}I will give you magic stone of blessings. Try thowing this to destroy it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006245	I used to take priest lessons before the Medis Diena. {nl}I'm here now because I like farming more.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006246	You will get hurt if you go near the magic circle rashly. {nl}Be sure to destroy the magic circle using magic stone of blessings.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006247	You did it! {nl}Now this farm is looking back like it should.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006248	This is the last one. {nl}The magic circle in Tarvas Entrance will have a lot of monsters interfering. {nl}With the divine power suppressed, the monsters are naturally drawn to that area.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006249	The magic circle isn't attracting the monsters. {nl}But it is suppressing the divine power and that's why the monsters gather.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006250	Now all the magic circles in this farm are destroyed. {nl}Now we can only hope for Horacius' work to succeed.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006251	Well this looks like the Goddess Statue that used stand? {nl}Seems like someone destroyed it on purpose.. Could it be the baron? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006252	At least you don't look like baron's people. {nl}We need help. We want to revive this farm back for whatever it takes. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006253	The baron is doing something to purify this farm. {nl}But recently the crops are dying and people are starting to fall sick. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006254	At first I didn't believe it but if this piece is really the Goddess Statue.. {nl}It's either the baron is lying to us or something is wrong.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006255	First, I better stick the pieces together. {nl}It may be a little blasphemous but can you get some sticky secertion from the monsters?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006256	I feel like it's soiling the Goddess Statue but I have nothing so we'll ahve to settle for that. {nl}The Goddess will forgive us.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006257	Yes. That will be enough. Let me try sticking this first. {nl}Oh, and one more thing.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006258	The baron has a bad reputation because of the things he has done. {nl}And for what he's been up to nowadays.. He must be planning on something. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006259	Some people say the baron is human after all so he won't do such things. {nl}So we need to collect clues to pursuade them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006260	If you head toward the crossroad, you'll see an oddly sparkling smoke. {nl}Attack the monster and just before it's killed, and take it there. You might find something, don't you think?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006261	No results yet? {nl}There should be some reaction whether good or bad if you check using the monster.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006262	Surely suspicious. {nl}If that aura is a bad aura, it wouldn't attack the monster, right? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006263	Got good evidence thanks to you. {nl}This might be enough to pursuade others. Thank you!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006264	Varas
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006265	No matter how much I think about it, the magic circles are the reason the harverst is bad. {nl}It's not purifying the land but rather making it worse.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006266	Even if this is the baron's order, this is too much. {nl}But what can I do when all I've held was the plow.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006267	This area used to be a fertile land. {nl}Since the baron's men made magic circles, harvest decreased a lot. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006268	Purify? That's not even funny. {nl}We, farmers, know better about the land.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006269	You can remove it by lighting fire with my firewood. {nl}But there is a protective shell so even if you light fire, the fire will easily die out. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006270	I think it's better to get kindlings from the Dandels all over the area to keep the fire.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006271	I can stand paying ridiculous farm rent fees at times like this. {nl}But how can he do that as a human?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006272	Did you solve it? {nl}That's great. But there are more magic circles.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006273	If the magic circles are really a like, then you should be able to remove the magic circles in Talia trails with Goddess' power. {nl}I mean something like the Goddess Statue. Is there any way to get it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006274	If the magic circle really is good, I can just pay more rent and ask for forgiveness. {nl}We'll know for sure if we check with Goddess' power.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150406_006275	But if it isn't, the baron better prepared. {nl}He fooled us, harmed the land, and lose colleagues.
