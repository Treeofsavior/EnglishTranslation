QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000116	It is still in progress to find the reality of the events.{nl}Take it. It's a soul collection scroll.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000129	At the end of everything that happened here, Bubbes were always involved.{nl}It is not a coincendence..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000130	I think.. I understand now. {nl}I think that was like a big factory creating huge monsters called Woodspirits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000131	The flag of Bubbes may have called the ghosts.{nl}The ghosts that were gathered polluted the trees and created huge monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000132	That tree barks must have been the ingredients for making Woodspirits.{nl}These must have not been done by thos Bubbes.{nl}They must have received an order from somebody!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000133	We may find something decisive at the place where Bubbes are grouped together.{nl}If Prey sees this, it will like it!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000134	Bubbes are not smart enough so he must have made only simple orders.{nl}How could he thought about controlling those bubbes..{nl}I don't know what to say. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000135	I am sure that Woodspirits are created from various places.{nl}I can sense vicious energies coming. {nl}We should first destroy the flag that is creating Woodspirits!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000136	Leave as soon as you are ready. {nl}The best action for now is to stop creating Woodspirits..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000137	I think we've done our best for now. {nl}Since we can't do anything about the ones that were already created.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000138	I can feel that the flag that is closest here is near Gatves Highway.{nl}The huge trees that the people saw is probably Woodspirits.{nl}How could I miss this simple thing.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001028	Was it you who Jojeff was looking for? {nl}I don't care if not. {nl}If you don't help me, you will be the same as those revelators who ran away.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001029	Anyways. I trusted the disciples, but I can't stand anymore.{nl}That's why I want to hire someone who is skillful like you. {nl}I will compensate you enough.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001030	Anyone would know that its because of the honey, but I don't know what the disciples are doing.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001031	I made a request at Klaipeda, but they are not responding since they have a lack of soldiers.{nl}And it is not easy to hire merceneries in this era.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001032	Then the ones that are left are the revelators.{nl}You looking for the goddess? we have the goddess in our village too.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001033	Look carefully on the unbroken bee boxes.{nl}You could maybe obtain some bee boxes that are in good status.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001034	Oh, this is quite big.{nl}Well done.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001035	You go back to Bulbini Farm.{nl}If we could provide a proof that it was due to the honey, the disciples would not only think about the altar.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001036	There are many altars around here.{nl}You know it already right? They are all created to praise Austeya Goddess.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001037	The disciples are only concentrating on the altars so they don't care whether we die in hunger or not.{nl}They think everything will be solved if they pray hard.{nl}That's why we decided to take an action.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001038	The bee box with that size, monsters will be lured to it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001039	How about it? Can you sense something?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001040	No response?{nl}Damn.. so he wasn't just going after the honey?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001041	The monsters were gathered near Bichiu Altar so I thought the honey was being collected there.{nl}If it wasn't for the honey, maybe there is a cause for it there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001042	You will see Bichiu Altar when you go down the road from here. {nl}If you see something suspicious, please bring it to me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001043	You came sooner than I expected.{nl}How about it? Did you check it?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001044	So the monsters were going after this fragment?{nl}This is my first time seeing it.. I should first check Gaudeji Altar up there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001045	If something suspicous comes out like a while ago, please hand it over to Ramar who is near the tree observatory tower.{nl}I really.. don't know.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001046	Ramar
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001047	Maras told you to show me this?{nl}This is the object that the disciples emphasized not to touch, was it broken like this originally?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001048	I should listen something from Maras.{nl}Something doen't feel right.. what's its use?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001049	Ris
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001050	The monsters ruined all the fields so I should somehow try to start it all over again.{nl}Ah well, I confronted a honeypin so I just ran away without carrying anything.{nl}My agricultural equipment.. I don't know what to do from now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001051	Thank you so much.{nl}The place where I lost it is Shirushie Sunny Fields.{nl}Honeypins are huge and scary so don't try too hard if you can't handle them.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001052	Ah. That's right. That's it.{nl}Everything will be okay if the villagers could take care of the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001053	Valda
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001054	Maras told us to gather all empty bee box pieces, but I think it doesn't make sense at all.{nl}If we were to do that, we should defeat the monsters!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001055	I beg you.{nl}Please think of it like saving a person and collect the bee box pieces for me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001056	Really? I am so touched.{nl}Ah, the location is Saltus bee farm.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001057	I can't do it this time even if we lose all the honey that we will consume next year.{nl}We may be better off just worrying about the lost farming equipment like Ris.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001058	Wow. So fragrant! {nl}Thank you so much. {nl}Ah, please keep it secret to Maras.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001059	We can't stop farming even if monsters are making mess.{nl}The monsters are still scary. Can you help me? It's not that hard.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001060	Really? Thank you!{nl}Please scatter these seeds on Radanja Farm. Then, I am counting on you!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001061	After you scatter the seeds, they will grow by themselves.{nl}Of course, you should take care of them sometimes while avoiding monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001062	I am relieved for now.{nl}The rest will be okay when Maras and Ramar get rid of the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001063	Disciple Raelie
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001064	Austeya Goddess is sealing two spots that are the source of the vicious energyy.{nl}However, due to demons' continuous attacks, the seal is getting weaker.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001065	That's why we lured the demons into demonic stones..{nl}Hasty behavior from the villagers created the trouble.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001066	You can never say that you are not responsible for this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001067	I don't know if it is due to the Day of Divine Tree, but the vicious energy started to gather from the deep inside the ground.{nl}The energy started to accumulate a lot and was about to explode.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001068	Austeya Goddess is trying her best to seal that energy.{nl}If she doesn't do that, this forest would turn into Vine Forest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001069	The only living creatures are monsters.. I am talking about the land that much davasted.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001070	I want to explain about the circumstances a bit, but the monsters will come this way soon.{nl}To prepare this kind of moment, we've prepared the protecting stone on the edge of the village.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001071	I am relieved by your words.{nl}If we don't protect this, the whole Siaulai forest may be destroyed so I am counting on you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001072	I will explain it to you in details after you come back.{nl}Please get rid of the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001073	I am now relieved a little.{nl}My greeting was late a bit. I am the disciple Raelie serving Austeya Goddess.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001074	You mean the purification before?{nl}Unlike the other revelators who were lured to the vicious energy, I purifed you in the name of the goddess.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001075	The goddesses already blessed the villagers, but they don't know about it well.{nl}The goddesses don't want chaos.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001076	It is good to hear that you feel responsible for it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001077	We have something to gain from purifying those demons.{nl}Please obtain the branches of bee trees that are endowed with the power of the goddess near the village.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001078	We should complete it quickly before the monsters rush in again.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001079	You brought them. Good.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001080	I told you a while ago that there are two sources of vicious energy.{nl}Among them, I will make a bead that will restore the seal that is located here.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001081	First, bring me the ashes of demons to be used as ingredient for the bead.{nl}When you pierce the demon with the branch of the bee tree, it won't be able to resist the divine power and become ashes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001082	But of course, the power of Goddess resides indirectly in it. {nl}So you will have to consume some of demon's HP before using it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001083	Good work. {nl}It's a uncomfortable to use demons as sacrifice.. Now we're in the final step.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001084	Take this bead. I made it in a hurry so it's not yet complete. {nl}You must fill it with the divine spell of the Goddess.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001085	Palama Cliff is the nearest place for it so please head there. {nl}The demons will soon be marching in so hurry.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001086	This will be enough. {nl}Please prepare to restore the seal. It might become a huge fight.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001087	The weak seal tower is in the near Stula Road. {nl}It bothers me that the demons were calm until now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001088	Please hurry. I can feel that the seal is weak. {nl}May you have the Goddess' blessings..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001089	Are you the revelator who purified the Seal Tower?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001090	I have been suppressing the evil force of this place.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001091	Please restore the Seal Tower in Spring Light Wood.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001092	After the evil force gushed out, plantes mutated and enlarged abnomally. {nl}It seems dangerous so I just watched from afar but it fumed out omnious forces. {nl}I'm worried those mutated plants might harm the village residents.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001093	That would be so thankful. {nl}But you don't know how dangerous it could be so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001094	So could it be the evil forces that turned it to become so grotesque?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001095	Ah.. the monsters were hiding in it. {nl}But it's a relief that you defeated it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001096	Greedy Druba

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001098	And so.. {nl}I want to ask for your help and have a scarecrow up with this charm. Hehe.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001099	I knew you'd get it. {nl}Now, if you want to put up a scarecrow, you'll have to gather the ingredients first. {nl}Please get me Oak Tree stems from around the village.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001100	I'd be really rich if things go well this time. Hehe..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001101	That's a lot. {nl}It's sure is good enough.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001102	Now, please put up this scarecrow with this charm in my farm. {nl}At times like this, I want to watch the fun all by myself.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001103	The farm is located on the left of Arklwy Crossroad. {nl}It's a bit far but that's how stay low from the villagers.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001104	Bankrupted Bee Farmer Rosen
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001105	It's all gone. I lost everything. {nl}I took care of the bee hives for years and the monsters destroyed everything. {nl}The priest told me to hold it but..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001106	Are you trying to comfort me? {nl}Then nothing would be better than showing those monsters a lesson.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001107	I know the priest is right but I can still rant about it, right?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001108	That feels better. {nl}How I wish they'd be gone forever.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001109	Priest Dajine
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001110	Dear revelator. I assume you've heard from Goddess Austeja. {nl}The other revelators who were dazzled by evil forces will attack the village before restoring the seal. {nl}
