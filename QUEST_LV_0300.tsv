QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000085	Svitrigaila tells you that, as a Revelator, it wouldn't be bad for you to help him commit suicide, and he asks you to gather some poisonous herbs for him.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000092	Seeing as there was no effect on Svitrigaila when he ate the poisonous herbs, it must be that he needs to mix them with holy water first, and then eat them to get the desired result. Find the Cleric Master and get the holy water from him.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000102	According to Svitrigaila, you need to amplify the power of the explosive powder in order to destroy the next terminal, and for that, you'll need to scrape off and collect particles from petrified objects in this area.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000103	Blow Up the Terminal
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000104	Use the explosive powder Svitrigaila gave you and the petrification particles you collected to blow up the second terminal.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000123	That area's known for its Bluebane..
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000124	Thank you. Let me try eating these one by one..
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000125	Just as I feared.. I'm still here.{nl}I heard the Cleric Master has holy water that, when mixed with Bluebane, can easily kill any demon.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000130	I will never involve myself in a demon's work.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000131	I see.. I should have expected that..{nl}I was a fool to hope otherwise.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000132	If it comes down this, I guess I'll have to try that method now.{nl}Destroying the Soul Compactor that's here..{nl}The beings that sent me here told me.{nl}The Soul Compactor and I are one and the same. Why didn't I remember this until now?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000133	Somewhere in this area is a Soul Compactor that absorbs human souls.{nl}It condenses their energy and uses it.{nl}This is a really suitable location for the Soul Compactor because even after the Stone Frost blew through, it's still bustling with the activity of the Kaliss Knights, grave robbers, and Kingdom Army soldiers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000134	{nl}{nl}If I think about it, the beings that sent me here must have linked my life with the Soul Compactor so that I could collect souls for them forever. So if the Soul Compactor is destroyed, wouldn't I die with it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000135	The Soul Compactor has 3 terminals from which it absorbs souls.{nl}That bad feeling you had earlier was also a terminal trying to absorb your soul.{nl}For now, try to wipe out those terminals.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000136	{nl}If you succeed in destroying a terminal, you should be able to retrieve its core.{nl}You need to collect those cores to craft an orb that will help you destroy the Soul Compactor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000137	Good job. This core will be used to make an orb that will overload the mainframe of the Soul Compactor.{nl}Now I can feel my death drawing near.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000138	Try blowing up the second terminal.{nl}Here, I'll give you some explosives, but you'll need to scrape off some particles from petrified objects in this area to amplify the power of the explosives.{nl}Since the Stone Frost blows through here often, there are plenty of petrified objects everywhere.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000139	Again, you'll need to retrieve the core from this terminal too.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000140	Now there's only one terminal left.. I feel myself getting weaker..{nl}The last terminal is probably short-circuiting.{nl}Try getting cores from petrified monsters in the area and throwing them at the terminal.{nl}That should be enough to make it collapse.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000141	And of course, bring back the core from the last terminal.{nl}Condensed souls are concentrated within those cores.. We just need to use them to craft an orb that will overload the Soul Compactor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000142	Now you've collected them all. Here, I'll give you the manual.{nl}Use this to craft the orb to overload the Soul Compactor.{nl}
