QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000092	Seeing as there was no effect on Svitrigaila when he ate the poisonous herbs, it must be that he needs to mix them with holy water first, and then eat them to get the desired result. Find the Cleric Master and get the holy water from him.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000102	According to Svitrigaila, you need to amplify the power of the explosive powder in order to destroy the next terminal, and for that, you'll need to scrape off and collect particles from petrified objects in this area.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000103	Blow Up the Terminal
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000104	Use the explosive powder Svitrigaila gave you and the petrification particles you collected to blow up the second terminal.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000124	Thank you. Let me try eating these one by one...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000125	Just as I feared... I'm still here.{nl}I heard the Cleric Master has holy water that, {nl}when mixed with Bluebane, can easily kill any demon.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000130	I will never involve myself in a demon's work.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000131	I see... I should have expected that...{nl}I was a fool to hope otherwise.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000132	If it comes down this, I guess I'll have to try that method now.{nl}Destroying the Soul Compactor that's here...{nl}The beings that sent me here told me.{nl}{nl}The Soul Compactor and I are one and the same. Why didn't I remember this until now?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000133	Somewhere in this area is a Soul Compactor that absorbs human souls.{nl}It condenses their energy and uses it.{nl}This is a really suitable location for the Soul Compactor because, {nl}even after the Stone Frost blew through, it's still bustling with the activity of the {nl}Knights of Kaliss, grave robbers, and the soldiers of the Royal Army.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000134	{nl}{nl}If I think about it, the beings that sent me here must have linked my life with the Soul Compactor so that I could collect souls for them forever. So if the Soul Compactor is destroyed, wouldn't I die with it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000135	The Soul Compactor has 3 terminals from which it absorbs souls.{nl}That bad feeling you had earlier was also a terminal trying to absorb your soul.{nl}For now, try to wipe out those terminals.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000136	{nl}If you succeed in destroying a terminal, you should be able to retrieve its core.{nl}You need to collect those cores to craft an orb that will help you destroy the Soul Compactor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000137	Good job. This core will be used to make an orb that will overload the mainframe of the Soul Compactor.{nl}Now I can feel my death drawing near.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000138	Try blowing up the second terminal.{nl}Here, I'll give you some explosives, but you'll need to scrape off some particles from petrified objects in this area to amplify the power of the explosives.{nl}Since the Stone Frost blows through here often, there are plenty of petrified objects everywhere.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000139	Again, you'll need to retrieve the core from this terminal too.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000140	Now there's only one terminal left.. I feel myself getting weaker..{nl}The last terminal is probably short-circuiting.{nl}Try getting cores from petrified monsters in the area and throwing them at the terminal.{nl}That should be enough to make it collapse.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000141	And of course, bring back the core from the last terminal.{nl}Condensed souls are concentrated within those cores.. We just need to use them to craft an orb that will overload the Soul Compactor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000142	Now you've collected them all. Here, I'll give you the manual.{nl}Use this to craft the orb to overload the Soul Compactor.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000143	I just want to rest...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000144	Is this the last time? Really.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000182	As to the words of the kingdom soldier, Retia, let's look for the soldiers who had been dispatched to the fortress at the shore. If they got into an accident, please collect their keepstakes. The monsters might have taken them so it would be good to hunt for the monsters at the Coastal Fortress.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000183	Return to the soldier, Retia
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000184	The soldiers, unfortunately died. You've collected their corpses so go back to Retia.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000185	Since you've collected all the corpses of the soldiers who've left to the fortress of the coast to fix the detector, it seems that you would be able to obtain some parts of the detector from Retia. Talk with her.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000212	Revelator! Are you okay?{nl}Petrification powder, it was so dangerous.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000213	I am guiding the spirits that were suffered by the petrified frosts long ago.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000214	But, this petrified frost is the curse of the demon king, Gesti..{nl}They make us Kupoles into stones.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000215	We should at least find out when the petrified frosts would blow.{nl}There are some petrification detectors which humans have left, but some seem to be broken.{nl}Can you help me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000216	The detector you saw seems to be working well.{nl}Please look at how other detectors are working.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000217	The petrified frosts turn everything into stones. Even spirits.{nl}We, Kupoles are not exceptions.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000218	Ah, that's it.{nl}Two of them are broken.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000219	We better ask about the detector problem to the soldiers who had created the detector.{nl}I heard the person who has the name, Retia is the officer so we may receive some help from her.  
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000220	He is at the Verkti Square.{nl}The human matters can't be resolved by Kupoles so we are counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000221	Are you talking about the problem at petrification detector at the Coastal Fortress.{nl}We are already aware of that. The problem can exist.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000222	By the way, it hasn't arrived yet? {nl}I've already dispatched the soldiers there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000223	I don't have a good feeling about this.{nl}Due to numerous monster attacks here, we don't have additional forces to send.{nl}Can I ask you to follow the soldiers who were dispatched for the repair?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000224	Maybe they had been attacked at the Coastal Fortress.{nl}But, they are the soldiers of the kingdom.  The dead bodies should be here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000225	The petrified frosts are reported frequently at the entrance of the Coastal Fortress so I think they will be around there.{nl}In case you find some corpses, please collect them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000226	I guess it was too late.{nl}Thanks for collecting the corpses.{nl}If you find the corpses, please collect them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000227	Please come back after fixing the petrification detector.{nl}I have some words to say.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000228	I am counting on you to guide all spirits to the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000229	Lastly, there's some story that they want to tell to the revelator.{nl}You would want to know why humans are suffering from this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000230	The rumor that the petrified frosts are the sin of the revolt is just a made-up story.{nl}The curse has come after the revolt so they may well think so.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000231	But, no. {nl}Everything was their plot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000232	But, the one who broke it first were the demons.{nl}That is this petrified frost.. they died and their spirits have become stones.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000233	The demon king, Gesti brought the curse of the petrification on this land and the goddesses tried to save the humans.{nl}But, the demons asked us whether we have forgotten not to interfere with each other's matters and..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000234	Wait. This memory is too horrible..{nl}A horrible catatrophe has landed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000235	
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000236	I am trying to save the spirits from now on.{nl}Since you fixed all the detectors, we would have to guide the spirits to eternal sleep.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000237	We will do our best to guide each and every one of them.{nl}I hope the goddesses bless you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000238	I guess you can't trust me since a demon like me is asking you a favor.{nl}But, look at me closely. It doesn't matter if you laugh at me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000239	I've tried my best to escape for hundreds of years continuously.{nl}But, the curse of the petrification is the power of the demon king. Endless depression is suffocating me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000240	
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000241	If you cooperate on my death, I will definitely remove your curse.{nl}I promise in the name of Giltine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000242	It doesn't matter what happens to my body.{nl}I just want to take some rest..
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000243	The poisonous plant that grows up there would be able to take my life away.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000244	I should pray that the poisonous plant of humans brings me the eternal sleep.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000245	Thanks. Now, I will pray for the end of my agonizing life.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000246	So nothing occurs as I expected.{nl}If that's the case.. We can't say we are in the distress. We just have to rely on the one that we want to eliminate.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000247	Please get the divine water to the one who follows the call of the goddesses.{nl}That sacred power would lead me to ad death.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000248	I heard Cleric Master handles that divine water.{nl}I don't know if he's gonna give to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000249	Are you talking about divine water?{nl}I am sorry, but may I ask you where you are going to use it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000250	There are demons who need the divine water?{nl}I am sorry, but I can't help you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000251	I am not going to be involved in your personal matter.{nl}No matter what the reasons are, I can't help demons' matters as a priest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000252	As a priest, I can't cooperate on the tasks of the demons.{nl}I hope you understand this as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000253	So.. that's it.{nl}Maybe, we've expected something that we shouldn't expect.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000254	The people who I believed to be my colleagues betrayed me. {nl}Then, there is no reason for me to hold on to this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000255	The demon lord has ordered me to collect the spirits of humans that will be dedicated to the god.{nl}That's why we began working on creating the integrator which would collect the spirits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000256	The process as smooth, but I was suffered by the petrified frosts.{nl}They laughed and told me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000257	That I will be the magic source of the integrator.{nl}How come I have forgotten it..
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000258	You must know by now.{nl}The curse that has been laid on the barrier stone.. we use humans to pull spirits from them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000259	The spirits that were pulled will be gathered to the integrator and dedicated to the god.{nl}The god.. it is like me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000260	The integrator is being protected by three barrier stones.{nl}Destroy the barrier stones down there and obtain the cores from them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000261	I will cast a spell on you so that you won't get cursed again.{nl}The integrator moves by swallowing my vitalities so it's easy. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000262	The guys who have abondoned me and laughed at me can't be called our colleagues.{nl}I will get a revenge on them by killing them. I will make them regret that they treated me like a magic source.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000263	Well done. The death is coming.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000264	The next barrier stone is up there. {nl}We have to put in the great power at once. Like an explosion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000265	Okay.. there was a grave robber among the ones who had been sacrificed.{nl}I tried to lead myself into a death using a bomb, but it was useless.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000266	We should not forget about the core of the barrier stone.{nl}To avoid being cursed again, I will cast a spell again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000267	How come I never thought about this.{nl}Maybe my loyalty has surpassed the fear of lonliness.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000268	The last barrier stone at the deep corner must be exploding by now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000269	As the monsters were being petrified, their last breathes were also solidified.. Throw those against barrier stones.{nl}They will gradually collapse.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000270	The core of the barrier stone is composed of the condensed spirits.{nl}We will make orbs by collecting those that would explode the integrator.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000271	I will put my last power onto the cores of barrier stones which you've collected.{nl}Pull out monsters' detonators with this and make an orb.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000272	Of course, I will give you a method to make the orb.{nl}The orb that would explode the integrator.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000273	And, please fulfill my last wish.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000274	I've handed over the method to make the orb with my power.{nl}It will be easy to make an orb.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000275	Succeeded...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000276	Do you know the meaning of the name, Giltine.{nl}Her name means death. The only thing that I can rely on at the moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000277	I once thought that I don't care how I turn myself into if it's for the demons long ago.{nl}But, only petrified frosts were blowing to me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000278	It started to get solidified for hundreds of years.{nl}My name has been erased from everyone's mind.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000279	Even if she doesn't bring me the eternal rest, it will be better than now.{nl}I just want to take some rest...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000280	The death is coming at me.{nl}I feel good.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000281	Yes. That's it. Give it to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000282	Within the keepstakes you've found for me...{nl}There must be some parts that will fix the detector at the Coastal Fortress.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000283	Here it is. {nl}The repair shouldn't be that hard.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000284	The Royal Army was taught that they should be loyal and honorable to the kingdom.{nl}And to be committed to due diligence when engaging in their duties.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000285	You came back from a long way.{nl}So these are the parts to fix the petrification detector.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000286	It's hard to obtain the parts, but the repair itself shouldn't be that hard.{nl}Let's return.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000287	Pillar
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000288	(It seems like something is written on the pillar.)
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000289	(It seems that some letters are visible, but I can't clearly see them.)
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000290	To be able to read the letters, you must have a piece of the symbol.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000291	{nl}You can obtain the piece of the symbol somewhere in Galeed Plateau.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000292	(Something is written, but is not readable.)
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000293	(It seems that something is written on it, but it can't be read in this condition.)

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000299	I'm not doing any more trades.{nl}Why do I have to experience this kind of shame?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000300	I want to see Justina...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000301	I feel like I age a hundred years whenever I deal with Pardoners.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000306	We better do our duty fast...{nl}We just have to hang tight a little longer...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000307	I am not sure how to return to the army.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000310	We are going to freeze to death instead of dying from hunger.{nl}Are there any better options?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000311	Thank you so much for saving me last time.{nl}I want to help you, but I am tied to the army...

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000321	There are some potatoes that are growing at Skaika Supply Route.{nl}It's not hard to pick them up...{nl}

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000324	I won't have any strength to fight by just eating meat.{nl}Everyone knows it's important to eat a variety of food.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000325	Since this place is colder than other areas, it is important to consume nutritious food.{nl}As a supply officer, I am having a hard time everytime.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000326	An outsider better go down the mountains.{nl}You would either freeze to death or hunger.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000327	Although the kindom has become famous, we are still soldiers.{nl}This is the military district and if you are an outsider, please leave.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000328	I heard that this place was used as a workhouse.{nl}We are able to find old materials easily, but the problem is food shortage.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000329	I am worried since the number of my men who are running away is increasing.{nl}Our supplies would last longer, but I am worried that I may become the only one left.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000684	Of course I won!{nl}But, I dropped his necklace into the sea which I've received as an evidence.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000685	Back then, I gave up since the sea was too deep...{nl}But I would be able to find it now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000686	If I can find it, I think I will be able to deal a blow to those who says I am a bluff.{nl}It is nearby Kranto Coast. {nl}You are a Corsair who is acknowledged by me, so you will be able to find it quickly.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000690	At least we will be able to remember the loyalty the army had dedicated to the kingdom.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000691	If you are a Doppelsoeldner, there is a task that you should do for the kingdom.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000693	I appreciate you saying that to me. {nl}Please look for the delegate of Commander Ramin secretly. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000694	The last contact was from Pasaka Canyon.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000695	That's so unfortunate. They've probably been attacked by the demons.{nl}You have all my support since you became an important member of the Doppelsoeldner.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000696	Ah, please keep this a secret to the others.{nl}I will find another way to contact General Ramin.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000702	First, I need you to get me the materials, so I can prepare it.{nl}I will write down the necessary materials and the locations to get those materials.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000703	This will be enough.{nl}We were able to finish this quickly because of your help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000704	It will take some time before we can extract the substances...{nl}In the meantime, I will teach you alchemy.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000707	The Scout Master and I used be the best friends.{nl}However, our relationship now is not as close as it used to be.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000708	In an effort to become closer, I want to give a present...{nl}I want to give something that the Scout Master likes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000709	Are you prepared for what I am going to request of you?

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000711	But, what if the monsters die...{nl}Unfavorable flavors may get mixed unless you pull them out when they are alive.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000712	To give you a hint, you better catch someone from behind.{nl}Understood?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000713	You've collected enough of them as expected.{nl}By fulfilling this request, I can tell that you won't have a problem learning the last skill.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000714	There are many people who have the same level of competence like you...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000715	Well, alright.{nl}Though, you need to understand that this will cost a lot from you, {nl}if you want to learn this at your current level.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000716	I've been searching for the arrows that the first Fletcher Master created from a long time ago.{nl}Those arrows were given to Lydia Schaffen as a present.{nl}I am certain that these arrows contain some sort of special skill.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000717	Recently, I've obtained useful information about the whereabouts of those arrows...{nl}There is a person who is able to identify the true value of those arrows.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000718	So, I've heard that the arrows are at Galeed Plateau.{nl}They were used when facing against some violent monster, so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000719	Oh. I've only seen it for a short period of time, but I can tell how amazing it is.{nl}I want to do a research on this arrow immediately, {nl}but I've made a promise with you, so that's the first thing I'm going to do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000720	Okay... Let's get started.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000721	As a Falconer Master, I am always looking at different options to make Falconers stronger.{nl}Recently, I've been thinking how I can make those flying monsters of use to us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000722	Of course I am satisfied with my partner, Rith..{nl}I think these attempts are helpful to Falconers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000723	When we tame a hawk, maybe we should feed it something?{nl}I don't have high expectations, but we better go there and try it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000724	I've placed some food for you to try it on at least three different types of monsters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000725	Did we fail... {nl}I expected it though.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000726	Regardless of the result, I should reward you for your effort.{nl}The biggest reward I can give to you would be teaching you new skills.{nl}What do you think?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000727	Shoot at an enemy and hit it...{nl}That's one of the basics of a Schwarzer Reiter.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000728	So you want to learn new skills, huh? {nl}Hitting an enemy with our eyes closed? How does that sound?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000729	Hahaha. However, we aren't blind. {nl}We shouldn't go that far, right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000730	I'm liking your confidence!{nl}I like it so much that we're going to put it to the test.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000731	Your objective is to consecutively hit the targets with an accurate aim.{nl}If you are able to do that, I will acknowledge your skills.{nl}So... I'd say about 200 times? Hm, I think that's too easy for you?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000732	I knew it wasn't a bluff! It was the confidence, am I right?!{nl}As promised, I will gladly become your teacher.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000733	The way of a true Monk...{nl}One should push oneself to extreme limits and endure the harsh training.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000734	If you are willing to take the challenge, then we will start immediately.{nl}Talk to me once you are ready for it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000735	Hurry up and stop talking to me!{nl}If you don't defeat enough enemies within the time limit, I will count again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000736	Very good.{nl}Now is the time for you to learn something from me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000737	I know that you are ready to be a good Pardoner...{nl}But I'm kind of in big trouble.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000738	Well, those impious monsters ripped off the book of offerings.{nl}Because of that, I can't proceed with my other tasks.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000739	I will tell you the location if you can get me that preliminary book.{nl}I think of you as a trustworthy person since we are close...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000740	The preliminary book is at Elkosh Abbey Hospital.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000741	In order to prevent someone from taking them, I've hidden them in the books...{nl}And I've prepared several fake books, so I want you to find them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000742	Welcome.{nl}I am looking for someone who is willing to help me with my research.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000743	Four years have passed after Medzio Diena...{nl}The aftermath of this disaster hasn't gone down, but it's getting bigger instead.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000744	Especially the plants that have grown so big turned into monsters and dealt a lot of damage.{nl}I am continuously doing research to resolve this issue.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000745	If you can help me with my research, I will teach you the next level of the Druid.{nl}I believe this will be an adequate assignment for you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000746	Please get me samples from the plants who have turned into monsters.{nl}You can obtain more samples the stronger the monster is.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000747	I know that my request was not easy to complete, but you've done it!{nl}These samples that you have brought me are excellent and are helpful in my research.{nl}As promised, I will help you since you helped me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000748	I know what business you have with me...{nl}That aside, we have something more important going on right now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000749	Suddenly, evil energy has become stronger in the place I used to look at with divine power.{nl}Using Clairvoyance doesn't even work anymore for me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000750	I'm asking you if you could get rid of the evil energy that's lurking there?{nl}If you do, I promise you that I will help you reach the next level.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000751	The location is Galeed Plateau.{nl}Please put the Purification of Namott that I gave you to the area where the evil energy is strong. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000752	I knew you were the right person to do this.{nl}As promised, I will lead you to the next level of the Oracle.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000753	Good. Let's get started right away.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000754	You need to fight the monsters until the time limit expires.{nl}As you defeat stronger monsters, I will acknowledge that you've went through hard training..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000755	If you don't defeat them within the time limit, you start from scratch. {nl}Be cautious.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000756	Dragoon Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000757	A Dragoon should never move too far away from an enemy when in danger.{nl}The Dragoon needs to have the courage to fight harder, better, faster and stronger.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000758	We reject the courage of those who fight without skills.{nl}The path of the Dragoon is a difficult path.{nl}So if you've came here without a strong determination, I suggest you leave now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000759	Alright, let's see if you really are worthy enough to become one of us.{nl}Show me your skills.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000760	Your objective is to battle monsters and embrace the pain. Do not move away from them.{nl}That's the determination of a courageous Dragoon. {nl}So, attack and defeat the monsters even if you take damage from them. {nl}Good luck.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000761	What's this? We don't want anyone with a careless mind.{nl}Since I like you, I am giving you another chance. {nl}Come on, show me your courage and your skills!
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000762	Excellent. You did good.{nl}From this day forward, I will acknowledge you as a member of the Dragoons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000763	Are you interested in becoming a Templar?{nl}I can already tell that you are very smart for making this choice.{nl}Now, let me give you a walkthrough of what you need to be aware of.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000764	A Templar is a leader to many people. We need people with strong leadership skills.{nl}Especially during these times, a Templar's leadership is most likely required.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000765	Don't get me wrong, though. This is often misunderstood as 'authority'.{nl}No, I'm leaning more towards 'cooperation'.{nl}You should cooperate with your followers in order to maintain a group.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000766	Do you understand what I am trying to tell you?{nl}With that being said, let's see your skills as a Templar.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000767	A person in authority makes orders, but a Templar should make requests.{nl}Your task is to recruit five people and become their leader in that group.{nl}While being the leader of the group, you have to lead them for quite some time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000768	The fuel that drives people is the respect.{nl}So, to confirm if you possess this charm, I will put you up to the test.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000769	Oh, I absolutely do not like to be deceived by tricks or anything like that.{nl}Recruit five people all by yourself and become the leader of the group.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000770	Well done.{nl}You are certainly much more charming than I expected.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000771	It can be tough to make other people follow you.{nl}The more people following you, the tougher it becomes.{nl}It's not easy, but a Templar with great respect and admiration can pull it off.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000772	I will tell you the things that a Templar must have knowledge in.{nl}I hope you will make wise and careful decisions in the future, so do not forget this.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000773	Warlock Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000774	We will take any measures by any means for the goddesses...{nl}That is the strict rule that we, Warlocks, must abide by.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000775	There are many people who misunderstand our interpretations.{nl}A Warlock and its evil spirits are not equally contracted.{nl}We have to rule over them and able to control the evil spirits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000776	In order to do so, you need to possess strong magic able to rule and control the evil spirits.{nl}Unless... you want to get eaten up by them. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000777	Since you don't know these evil spirits that well like I do...{nl}I will give you a scroll that will wake them up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000778	Use this scroll on monsters at Valius' Eternal Resting Place to wake up the sleeping evil spirits.{nl}To add another part of this challenge, you need to defeat a monster and the evil spirits.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000779	Get rid of the poison with poison. {nl}Anything else that is evil should be gotten rid of by the evil spirits. {nl}I am waiting for the day when we, the Warlocks, are not needed anymore.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000780	Excellent.{nl}This is much better than I had expected.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000781	From now on, you will tread the path of the Warlock. {nl}Oh, and please remember this...{nl}If you don't stand on top of them, you will be consumed by them...{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000782	Featherfoot Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000783	I don't know how you found out about the curse of the Featherfoot, but...{nl}This curse should not be overused. Rather, it needs some detailed calculations.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000784	Of course, I can teach you if you still want to. However...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000785	Since you don't know anything about the curse, I ask you to take these incantation tools.{nl}I told you that it requires detailed calculations before using the curse.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000786	Find out what there is to lose and what there is to gain...{nl}Use these incantation tools to cast the curse on a monster to find out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000787	If you learn something here, you will become a great Featherfoot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000788	The curse should not be overused, but instead it requires some detailed calculations.{nl}Experience what the magic used by a Featherfoot is like with help of the tools.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000789	Now, do you have a broader understanding of the Featherfoot's curse?{nl}You should not consider it like the curse that is used by Demon Lords like Naktis.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000790	The arrows of the curse shall only be used on the enemies of the goddesses.{nl}For us, that is our most important guideline. Please keep that in mind.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000791	Cannoneer Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000792	You enrolled to become a Cannoneer? Good choice, hotshot.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000793	Listen up! The most important attribute of the Cannoneer is firepower!{nl}If a Cannoneer cannot distinguish between aerial attacks and ground attacks, {nl}he or she isn't a valuable asset to the team!{nl}Enemies that are flying in the air should only be attacked by aerial attacks,{nl}and enemies that are on the ground should only be attacked by ground attacks.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000794	I figured you should know about this if you want to become a skilled Cannoneer, like me.{nl}What about it, hotshot? You interested?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000795	Good! Alright, hotshot. {nl}I can only assume that you will remember what I will teach you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000796	Do you have a paper and pen with you? Remember this.{nl}There are many types of enemies, but the ones that are flying in the air are all aerial-type.{nl}In contrast, the ones that are moving on the ground are considered a walking-type.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000797	Alright, face against monsters with both these types.{nl}You need to understand how each enemy moves and which attacks are effective.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000798	The flying monsters are aerial-types and the ones that move on the ground are walking-types.{nl}Face against both types of monsters. Understood?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000799	Good.{nl}Was this a good lesson? Am I a good teacher?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000800	Alrighty then! Theoretically, you should know all the logic about what I've taught you.{nl}It's time to put the theory into practice!{nl}The skills of a Cannoneer are not easy, so make sure to focus!
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000801	Muskeeteer Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000802	A Muskeeteer should know how to handle a rifle.{nl}Not many enemies can stand against simultaneous firing by well trained Musketeers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000803	That is why marksmanship is really important.{nl}Finishing enemies before they come anywhere nearby is the start of marksmanship.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000804	One of the basic aspects of marksmanship is to procure range.{nl}Give it a shot. Attack an enemy at maximum range.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000805	It's not just extending the range, but to extend it up the {nl}maximum distance where you are able to shoot.{nl}I am going to put you to the test to see how well you perform.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000806	It's not just extending the range, but to extend it up the {nl}maximum distance where you are able to shoot.{nl}If you want to become a Musketeer, you will accept my challenge.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000807	Now that you know the basics of the Musketeer, it's time to put this in practice.{nl}Alright, let's teach you how to use a rifle!

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000810	Enhancing the harmful effects even further and to cure allies who are hurt by these effects.{nl}To put it simply, we are an expert in harmful effects.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000811	Of course I am willing to teach you even if you are not in such a hurry.{nl}But before that, I want you to experience the harmful effect yourself.{nl}It'll be quicker that way, don't you agree?{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000812	Use this mask on a poisoned monster at Coastal Fortress.{nl}And use it on a sleeping monster at Dingofasil District.
