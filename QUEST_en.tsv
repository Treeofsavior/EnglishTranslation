QUEST_20150317_001139	Klaipeda Wagerer
QUEST_20150317_001140	Klaipeda Wagerer{nl} (A Wagerer of Klaipeda)
QUEST_20150317_001141	{nl}{nl}There was a man named Modestas in Klaipeda long time ago.{nl}He was a good person, he had a big flaw so his friends and relatives were all worried about him. Especially his wife had many concerns. {nl}He was not lazy, he wasn't clever, but not too ignorant, he didn't drink a lot and he didn't like to fight with other people. {nl}He just had one flaw; he liked betting too much.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001142	Modestas worked hard in the day time so he never skipped meals. {nl}However, when he earned the amount of money that is more than enough to support his family, he always used to bet on things. His wife tried hard saving money, but the circumstances did not improve at all.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001143	So Modestas' wife went to the statue of the goddess or shrine when she had time to pray for her husband. {nl}Even after his wife's praying, he didn't stop betting, and the people worried about him more and more. Bettings or gambles, even if they start out small, they eventually have chances to become big. {nl}Anyway, the time passed. and one day..
QUEST_20150317_001144	Modestas, as usual, was returning home after losing his money on betting. {nl}As he was walking to Klaipeda after going past Siaulai Forest, he met an old woman in the quiet forest way. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001145	The old woman wasn't just old, but she looked somewhat scary and suspicious. {nl}Modestas thought it would be better to ignore the woman and just keep walking on his way, and the old woman was also concentrating on her work so she didn't even look at Modestas.{nl}Nothing would have occured if Modestas was keep walking on his way, but the task that the old woman was working on caught Modestas' eyes.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001146	To tell you exactly, the object that the old woman was holding caught his eyes and feet.{nl}The old woman was surprisingly holding two golds and thinking about something. {nl}Modestas was more interested in the old woman's attitude so he walked towards the old woman.
QUEST_20150317_001147	and he asked the old woman what she was doing.{nl}So the old woman answered to him.{nl}"If these two golds get married each other, they will have baby golds so I will be rich, but it seems that they won't get married."{nl}After listening to what the woman told him, told her, {nl}"If you want to be righ with those golds, you should run your business or invest those golds into something profitable. Do you think marrying those two golds makes sense?"{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001148	The old woman answered.{nl}"Why not? If they marry each other, this will be the best way. Safe and certain."{nl}"Instead of saying such non-sense, I think betting on things like me would be way better."{nl}After Modestas said this, the old woman seemed to be angry.
QUEST_20150317_001149	and then she said this.{nl}"so you think my plan to make money is worse than you betting on things?"{nl}"Of course. Betting could win or lose, but with your plan, the amount of golds won't increase at all."{nl}After Modestas said this, the old woman thought about something a bit and told Modestas.{nl}"Okay then do you want to bet with me?"{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001150	Modestas suddenly felt something weird and he was scared a bit, but when the old woman mentioned betting, he couldn't resist his instinct and asked her.{nl}"What betting?"{nl}"Bet on who would make more money, your way or my way."{nl}"But what if I lose?"{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001151	"Don't worry about that. You may lose or win. I can't change that. But, I can change the turns."{nl}"What? what do you mean?"{nl}"If you accept the betting with me, no matter who you bet with, from now on, you will win one time and you will lose next time."{nl}"That's a common thing in the world of betting."{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001152	After Modestas said this, the old woman continued explaining.{nl}"What I am telling you is that, after you leave this place, you will lose for sure on the first bet you would do. And the next bet, the second bet you would do, you will lose for sure."{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001153	Modestas was puzzled and asked again.
