QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000197	You want to learn Quarrel Shooter Skills from me? {nl}Right on time. I was also looking for someone to help me.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000198	You were sent by Quarrel Shooter Master right? {nl}You must find the map. A map hidden with Fletcher's secrets. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000199	Sapper Master says he found some information about the book I'm looking for. {nl}Go to Siauliai Eastern Woods and meet him. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000202	Oh, is this the map? Good job. {nl}I'll teach you my skills as promised. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000203	Is this the map? I really can't tell. {nl}Take it to Quarrel Shooter Master. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000204	So you came to learn more skills from me. {nl}Then go help Rodelero Masters in Fedimian. I will evaluate with that. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000205	Did your Archer Master send you?{nl}Klaipeda is becoming stable but Fedimian is still like this. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000206	I hear that most of Fedimian, aside from Divine Area, is buried and in need of help. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000207	I want you to defeat the boss monster in Maze Tower. {nl}Monsters are pouring out of the Maze Tower {nl}when we don't even have enough resources to reconstruct Fedimian.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000208	According to the scout who made it in, it was Minotaurs of Maze Tower 3rd Floor. {nl}Defeating it will be good enough as a warning. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000209	Well done. The monsters are laying low thanks to you. {nl}Extend my gratitude to Archer Master too. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000210	Well done. {nl}I will train you to be stronger as promised. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000211	You want to learn the skill of Ranger from me? {nl}Okay. If you help me, I'll consider it depending on how you do. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000214	I heard you're looking from someone who wears a hoodie and has a unique scent. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000215	Of course I remember. It was a man with a dangerous scent. {nl}He asked about materials that not much people know about so I thought he was strange. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000216	Eboniphon.. I will never forgive him. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000218	How would I know his whereabouts? {nl}He asked about materials that I did not have so I told him where he could get it. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000220	This scent.. yes, it's Eboniphon's.{nl}This will be enough. I will teach you my skills as promised. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000221	Yes, this is the scent. {nl}It was very unique so I couldn't forget it even if I wanted to. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000223	Hey, if you came wanting to be stronger, you've come to the right place. {nl}But you can't have it for nothing. You have to do me a favor. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000226	Oh, right. You should be able to do it easily if you want to become a Sapper. {nl}Now you just have to help with this experiment. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000227	Well, it's pretty simple. {nl}Check how effective this bomb is on the monsters in Siauliai Eastern Woods.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000228	I do hope it works this time..
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000229	They fell back without much damage? {nl}Hmm, what could the problem be.. I got to check from the beginning again. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000230	Anyway, Thanks. {nl}You can come anytime if you want to learn my skills. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000231	You want to learn about the Bokors? {nl}Then first, get me the card that you can get from powerful monsters. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000232	It doesn't matter which card it is as long as it's from the powerful monster. {nl}What you will bring to me is already decided. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000233	Complete. Traveler. Promised victory. Perfect world. {nl}Full interpretation is for you to do.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000234	Sometimes the harsh fate destined can lead to the dark future. {nl}I will lead you to the path of Bokor as promised. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000235	I'm looking for a cat that can model but I'm old and it's not easy. {nl}Bring a suitable cat and I'll teach you my skills. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000236	Grandpa Tesla wants a cat? {nl}Cats are all over Klaipeda Plaza but it won't be easy to catch one unless with special food. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000237	I like cats because they do the basics. {nl}The cats have all lines. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000238	I can give you the special food for catching a cat. {nl}If you find my father, I will give it to you for free!
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000242	I'll give you the special cat food as promised. {nl}It's made with stuff that the cats like so it should work.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000243	Oh oh, it's that cat. {nl}I'll take you to a higher level as promised. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000244	I've traded for a long time with Klaipeda Item Merchant who might help you. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000245	I want you to do something in return for learning magic from me. {nl}It's simple but a little dangerous. Would you like to give it a try? {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000247	If you find it dangerous, get out quickly. {nl}I'll just have to find another disciple.
