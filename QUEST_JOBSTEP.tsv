QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000466	I need to test if you are qualified to learn my skills. {nl}Defeating Sparnashorn seems fair enough for someone like you, what do you think?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000467	I heard Sparnashorn is huge, so it spends most of its time on the ground rather than in the air.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000468	I didn't expect you to defeat it. That's pretty good. {nl}Alright. You can come anytime you want to learn skills.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000475	Unfortunately, we're out of the Nicotia that the Cleric Master is asking for. {nl}There was an urgent request so it had to be used.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000476	But don't worry. {nl}Nicotias grow all over the place so it'll be fine if you just take the young shoots.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000477	Nicotia is not far away from here. {nl}Send my regards to the Cleric Master.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000492	Will you take on the vocation of Priest and follow the path of Goddess? {nl}You can do so by getting rid of evil.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000493	Evil forces are showing up in the Starving Demon's Way in Fedimian. {nl}Extract its identity from it and smudge it with the name of Goddess.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000494	$Anyone who follows the words of the Goddess can receive her powers to drive out evil spirits. {nl} But that strength will depend on the depth of one's faith.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000495	Well done. {nl}In the name of the Goddess, please judge the evil in this world so they are unable to get a foothold.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000502	You've brought it.{nl}But...damn.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000503	The curse in this jewel is calling Tutu here.{nl}While I figure out how to handle this curse, there is something that you should do.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000504	First, tell the Krivis Master to prepare the memorial service.{nl}After that, please go to the East Siauliai Woods and block Tutu.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000505	Something could happen when the power of the curse gets stronger.{nl}Our mission is to stop that.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000506	Yes. In fact, that jewel is the one that a young priest from the village picked up.{nl}After he brought this jewel, he suffered from nightmares so I made a request to the Bokor Master.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000507	Okay anyways. I will prepare the memorial service.{nl}Don't worry about it and just block Tutu from the East Siauliai Woods before it comes to Klaipeda.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000508	These things happen because the world is in chaos.{nl}The Goddess must feel sad about it...
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000509	I cleverly dealt with it because of your help.{nl}As a Bokor, I can expect you to grow from now on.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000511	Return to the Bokor Master fast and tell her about it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000512	It's good that you are learning skills from me, but I want you to also understand the importance of caring after that.{nl}The priests in Klaipeda requested care for the statue of the Goddess, how about that?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000513	{memo X}I want you to get the perfumed oil used for maintaining the statue first.{nl}If you ask the priests, they will give it to you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000514	This is the perfumed oil.{nl}Since Tesla is too old, I was worried that my request may be too much, but I guess it's alright now.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000515	This is all I have..{nl}I heard the Krivis Master also has some.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000516	Perfumed Oil? Ah, here it is.{nl}Please take care of the statue.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000517	Please tell Tesla that I am okay.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000519	That's the task we entrusted to you, so if you need it we will give to you. {nl}Here you go.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000520	Even if you receive perfumed oil from the Priest Master, it may not be enough.{nl}You should take great care with it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000521	The amount of perfumed oil you have seems a bit lacking.{nl}Since the Bokor Master also has some oil, why don't you go meet him?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000522	Perfumed Oil? we will definitely give it to you.{nl}Tesla told us that he doesn't need any pay for that, so we felt sorry about it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000523	Too bad I can't go with you since I don't have enough time.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000524	The statues that we entrusted to you are the statue in Fedimian and the statue in Klaipeda.{nl}Okay then, I am counting on you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000525	If you use the absolute power of the Goddess, your journey to Fedimian should be a little easier.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000526	Well done.{nl}Return to Tesla.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000532	First of all, a Paladin shows by acting rather than telling.{nl}Prove your religious belief of the Goddess by dueling against me.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000723	Even if someone becomes the world's greatest archer, consumption of arrows will always be a problem. {nl} Lydia Schaffen's bow was used with great care. However, Schaffen too, uses arrows. {nl} But unlike fired arrows, Her bow is permanent even with continued use.  {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000724	Even if it was impossible to create arrows that can be used permanently, Lydia Schaffen delved into arrow making techniques. {nl} Getting materials neccesary to make arrows was another problem. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000725	Troubled greatly by this problem, Lydia Schaffen went on a journey to find the solution. {nl} Whether or not she had been granted blessing by the Goddess when she met the Fletcher Master or if she found the solution to her problem, Historians will continue to debate about the topic. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000726	Many Fletchers had been produced ever since the dawn of time. But talentless numbers are irrelevant. {nl} People just call him the Fletcher Master, Lydia Schaffen too,was uncertain of his name. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000727	Ever since his rise to fame, People called him the Fletcher Master. People who knew his real name were swept away by the passings of the river of time. {nl} His real name, according to some scholars, was said to be John Blacksmith. but the name itself isn't getting any credibility, since you cannot readily accept a famous name that common. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000728	Anyway, Lydia Schaffen met this the Fletcher Master who was an arrow expert. Lydia after overcoming her journey, was ready to learn. {nl} However, arrow making techniques by the Fletcher Master was a secret at that time, and in the years afterwards, a stuff among legends. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000729	However, even if you are the world's greatest archer, The Blessing of the Goddess is important to learn the arrow making techniques of the Fletcher Master. {nl} Therefore only someone who has the blessing of the Goddess can be molded to create a the Fletcher Master, like how Lydia Schaffen created new and consistent arrows. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000730	Another tale is of the Fletcher Master's secret to avoid combat according to the maker's manual is to hit with certainty somewhere in the spleen. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000731	The rapid production of arrows by the Fletcher Master is regarded to be his sole talent. However he may have a secret lying in wait somewhere in this world. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000732	Lydia Schaffen Crossroads
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000733	{S35} {nl} Lydia Schaffen Crossroads {/}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000734	This is a record to the Royal Family about a story when King Kadumel asked Lydia Schaffen whether she can hit a target behind a boulder or a tree, and how she simply answered the King with the crisp sound of her arrow hitting the target. However, there are some written inconsistency from the royal record and the folklore. That is, King Kadumel noted at the time, he was not giving Schaffen a test of her abilities with a bow.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000735	A more important fact is what sort of targets Lydia Schaffen hit. Or to put it more precisely, who she hit, would be of great significance.{nl}Whenever the royal records and the folklore handle this story, they do not reference the time when it arose.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000736	Both versions simply introduce the heroic story by focusing on Lydia Schaffen's great bow skills.{nl}There is a certain reason for this.{nl} The reason is that this story happened in the final days of the Civil War. Differing from the known folklore, Ruklys was not killed by King Kadumel's soldiers in the last layer of the Fortress of Great Land. It is said that Ruklys had a particular reason for not letting any outsiders into the heart of his fort.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000737	Rather than dying, Ruklys escaped moments before his fort was overrun, and King Kadumel ordered his soldiers to go pursue him.{nl} After the pursuit, Ruklys found himself cornered at the edge of a cliff.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000738	There was a large enough rock on the cliff for Ruklys to put his back against while facing the cliff and keeping the King's soldiers at the opposite face of the rock.{nl} Ruklys leaned his back on the rock so the King's Archer who tracked him could not attack.{nl} If it were a different location they could have gone to the left and right to surround and rain arrows, but the cliff, alongside the battle formation, was not a place for such attacks.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000739	Having no archers who could shoot across the air beyond the cliff, King Kadumel unquestionably drove his soldiers towards the edge of the cliff.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000740	However Ruklys and his remaining men repelled the King's soldiers, showing their inhuman ability to persist day and night. This even caused the King's peasant soldiers to begin to waver.{nl} Furthermore, Ruklys's heroic struggle made such an impression to some of Kadumel's men and officers, that some started questioning Kadumel's command.{nl} Already unpopular among people under his rule, King Kadumel could not continue pushing his men to their death, he also could not wait until Ruklys died of hunger or fatigue.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000741	And through this situation, King Kadumel asked a clever question to Lydia Schaffen.{nl}  Of course, Lydia did not take King Kadumel's provocation as a chance to show her skills and fire a meek high angle shot to kill Ruklys. There were other reasons that were overlapping here.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000742	But considering these reasons, in any case, such as having her master's wishes, or the thought that she ended someone's life through her own hands, we as the current generation can only guess how hurt and conflicted were Lydia Schaffen's emotions. Henceforth, people became knowledgeable of the time when Lydia Schaffen easily pierced a target behind a boulder from the crossroad, however, Lydia would bear an immeasurable complex emotion about the crossroad from that day forward.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000745	{memo X}$This story is said to have taken place one day at the Tower of Stars.{nl}A dispute among the disciples of Lydia Schaffen broke out.{nl}Several disciples gathered after the training and in the process such a dialogue is said to have come up: 'No matter how good your bow is, if your skills are lacking, you can't bring out its full potential. Therefore, what is important in the end is your own skill.'{nl}Such was a claim of a certain disciple, which started the dispute.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000746	{memo X}$'You are forgetting the basics of Archery. What is an Archer? It is someone who uses a tool called a bow, right?{nl}Do you think an Archer existing without a bow is possible? {nl}Even if one gets famous for their skill with sword and spear, can one still call themselves an Archer? In the end, Archery is the concept of depending on tools, isn't it?'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000747	{memo X}$The disciple who had a different view argued back:{nl}'You said tools are important, let's talk about that.{nl}What is a bow? There are various weapons for an Archer. Just like there are weapons that don't need much skill to handle, like a crossbow, there are also weapons, effectiveness of which varies a lot based on a user's skill, like the ones of the Wugushi.{nl}The Wind Arrow of the Wugushi is hard to master, it's a difficult weapon to wield for someone without an experience, no matter how good the materials of one's bow are.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000748	$However, calling a catapult or a crossbow a weapon anyone can handle is not correct.{nl}You claim Archery exists solely because there are tools, this is wrong.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000749	{memo X}$This is the same as saying that since people will die if they don't eat, their lives are less important than food and depend on it.{nl}Are you claiming that since you eat to be able to live on, you are living to eat?'{nl}Upon that, another disciple shared his viewpoint:{nl}'You are arguing about the Path of the Archer, but you are only concentrating on one aspect.{nl}What you fail to address is that no matter how famous an Archer one is, no matter how eagle-eyed one is, what they are using to their advantage is the wind. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000750	{memo X}$The arrow could not be shot if it wasn't for the wind and air that carries it to the mark, how could any sharpshooter exist, or rather, how much would an Archer be able to do in that case? In the end, what is necessary for an Archer is to sense the wind flow and to be able to act on it.'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000751	$From then on, the disciples argued to no end, claims became more diverse and interesting, theories fired back and forth.{nl}Finally, they started wondering about what their master, Lydia Schaffen, would think of this.{nl}After having told her about the discussion they've had so far, they waited for her reply.{nl}

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000758	$This is a story about Lydia Schaffen that has been handed down throughout the Kingdom. {nl}Furthermore, while there are places that Lydia Schaffen has never been to according to historical records, there are stories about what happened when she visited their village.{nl}These stories contain absurd things such as dragons appearing, a strange demon which is different from the demon we know laying a wager with Lydia Schaffen.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000759	$In spite of that, the villagers from the region believe the story beyond doubt, and they embrace the pride that this story about Lydia Schaffen brings, having originated from their hometown.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000760	$Compared to Ruklys, who likely died early on during the Civil War, or Flurry, who rarely left the tower she built, Lydia Schaffen definitely went on a greater number of adventures around the world, making her the most suitable as the protagonist of a story.{nl}This is one of those stories.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000761	$It is not known how true the story really is. Perhaps it was just as absurd in the past as it would definitely be absurd in the present. Still, the fact that it is still told today means the story agrees with the nature of Lydia Schaffen.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000762	{memo X}$One day Lydia Schaffen left a certain village alone and walked around at night.{nl} Lydia Schaffen saw a traveler sitting wearily at the roadside on a woodland road. {nl} Out of curiosity, she decided to approach him.{nl} 'Why are you sitting here in the forest in the middle of the night?'{nl}The traveler was hesitant to answer at first, but after being asked multiple times he finally opened his mouth. {nl}The reason was apparently this: {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000763	$The traveler had met a demon named Rumpelstiltskin when passing through the forest several days ago. {nl}Then he was lured into playing a game with the demon. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000764	$The reward for winning the game was significant, but the game with the demon was not easy. In the end, the traveler lost to Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}The traveler kept sighing as he waited for Rumpelstiltskin to come back. {nl} After hearing the traveler's story, Lydia Schaffen decided to confront the demon. She promised to the traveler that she'll help him with all her might. Some time passed, and Rumpelstiltskin appeared.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000765	$Lydia offered Rumpelstiltskin to let the traveler go and play a game with her in exchange. {nl}For better or for worse, Rumpelstiltskin was well aware of Lydia Schaffen's reputation, and the fact that she requested a game with him excited him into accepting her request. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000766	{memo X}$In the past, Rumpelstiltskin was quite famous for challenging his opponents to use their best skill and then defeating them. {nl} But, he changed the rules of his game a bit every time. {nl} Lydia Schaffen asked: 'I understand that you want to challenge my Archery skill, so what are we going to do?'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000767	{memo X}$'Of course, a game to see who is better with a bow would not be that interesting. Therefore, let's play a game where you fire an arrow at a target, and then I will try to catch and ride the arrow before it reaches the target,' said Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}Lydia replied, questioning the proposal: 'Ride an arrow?'{nl}'That is correct,' averred Rumpelstiltskin.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000768	{memo X}$Upon answering, Rumpelstiltskin started to shrink his body.{nl} Once he had reduced himself to the size of a child's fist, Rumpelstiltskin spoke: 'Well, this size will allow me to ride your arrow, right?'{nl}Lydia Schaffen thought for a bit,{nl}'There is a problem with that, though. If you touch the arrow and cause it to fall to the ground without it ever hitting the target, then wouldn't that still be a loss for me regardless of whether you rode the arrow or not?'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin answered her with these words.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000769	{memo X}$'Then how about this. I win if I can ride your arrow until it reaches the target.'{nl} 'And if your arrow falls to the ground,' he continued, 'then we both lose.'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin added, 'The game shall have three rounds, best two out of three.'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000770	{memo X}$After Rumpelstiltskin's seemingly honest answer, Lydia Schaffen replied, 'Alright, one more thing: I'm going to shoot at any target, in any direction. I'll tell you what the target is each round. This way, you won't be able to get used to it for rounds two and three. Are you okay with this?{nl}'Alright, let's do that,' agreed Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}After also agreeing upon terms of defeat, the game between two people, err, one person and one demon began.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000771	{memo X}$Lydia Schaffen weighed her arrow, then called out the first target:{nl}'The tallest brown tree over there!'{nl}With those words, she released the arrow and it sliced through the air at a frightful speed{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000772	{memo X}$Rumpelstiltskin moved nimbly to chase the flying arrow, and after he got on, the arrow impaled the tree. As the arrow continued to oscillate, he danced to the rhythm of the oscillation and sang an unknown tune.{nl}Lydia Schaffen again gauged her arrows, then she called:{nl}'All of the cones on that pine tree on my front-left side!'{nl}Upon calling the target, Lydia Schaffen unleashed her godlike Archery skills. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000773	$Her arrows poured faster than heavy rain during a hot summer day, as if hundreds, or even thousands of arrows were fired at the same time in the same direction. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000774	$Rumpelstiltskin couldn't take it as calmly this round. Faster than the human eye could distinguish, Rumpelstiltskin landed on each arrow one by one and transferred to another as the barrage cut through the air. In the end, he was able to get onto the last arrow before it reached the last pine cone.{nl}Rumpelstiltskin spoke to Lydia Schaffen while trying to catch his breath.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000775	{memo X}$'So there, I managed to sit on every single arrow before the last arrow reached the target. I win.'{nl} Lydia Schaffen replied,{nl}' Certainly, I can't deny the fact you sat on every arrow before the last one reached its target.'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000776	{memo X}$Rumpelstiltskin gave a wicked grin after hearing Lydia Schaffen's words and said,{nl}'Meaning, I won this game. Now, as for the penalty we agreed on…'{nl}Before Rumpelstiltskin could finish, Lydia Schaffen shook her head and spoke,{nl}'Don't tell me that because you won two rounds, you won't play the final round? It's not acceptable, we clearly promised to play three rounds anyway, didn't we?'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000777	{memo X}$'The game doesn't end before the third round, so I think it's pointless to talk about penalties before the game has actually ended…'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000778	{memo X}$Recognizing that he has already won two rounds and had no reason to refuse a third, as well as the fact the game was certainly not over yet, Rumpelstiltskin had no choice but to abide by Lydia Schaffen's words.{nl}And so the final round began, Lydia Schaffen gauged her last arrow, and called out as she pulled the bowstring back:{nl}'My target is… the moon in the sky!'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin side-saddled the arrow as soon as it left the bowstring, and not before long, he realized what he heard.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000779	$And, as he rode the arrow towards the moon, Rumpelstiltskin also realized the fact that the game couldn't end until he reached it.{nl}As time passed, the power of the arrow subsided and it began falling towards the ground. However, after a time the arrow that Rumpelstiltskin rode on stopped still, floating in the sky.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000780	{memo X}$Just as Rumpelstiltskin, grinding his teeth, was about to open his mouth, Lydia Schaffen said,{nl}'For the game to end, you need to ride the arrow until it arrives at its target. The game cannot end before then. If you manage to touched the moon and come back, then I will definitely accept the penalty.'{nl}Having said so, Lydia Schaffen began walking away as Rumpelstiltskin watched, grinding his teeth once again, unable to change the course of the game.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000781	$According to the anecdote, Rumpelstiltskin has not reached the moon yet, and is still flying there using the magic in his body. {nl}One can only guess if he will manage to return before his demonic life span ends.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000782	$Nevertheless, as we know, Lydia Schaffen has passed away long ago. So while the demon did not lose the game, he has lost his chance to win the game forever. {nl}Still, the one matter left that we, as the current generation, are curious about is what the agreed penalty between Lydia Schaffen and Rumpelstiltskin was. {nl}Of course, we could ask a particular person, err, demon, that may or may not still be alive. However, as we do not know when he will return, it will be hard to settle this lingering matter for quite some time.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000783	$Atman Extension
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000784	$Atman Extension
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000785	$Congratulations on receiving this book, which no criminal may see. There are many ways to use magic, but the magic used by Linkers are a particular case. Other mages exercise effect-based powers rather than magic. That is to say, to fight an enemy with a fireball, or with lightning, does not truly bind the enemy with magic. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000786	$These attacks only use magic to make a fireball and lightning. Then, the mages control the magical energy's direction and destination, releasing it after settling on both.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000787	$In other words, these mages are unable to handle enemies without Linkers; as they need to channel and regulate surrounding energy, these mages do not have the time to easily handle targeting their magic towards an enemy. However, as you have chosen to walk the path of the Linker, the way of your magic will differ completely. The way of a Linker's magic is by directly linking your magic with your opponent's magic, which includes searching for your target within seconds.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000788	$Also, in the case of linking more than 2 targets, a Linker's way of magic is complicated even further if the targets have mutually opposing properties. In these situations, the Linker must use a viable magical property to connect the targets with opposing properties.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000789	$Thus to some extent, the Linkers are experienced magic users who still have a lot of new fields to test. Even if there are those predestined to be Linkers, fledging mages who have developed their abilities to control magic are recommended becoming Linkers and walking the path of a Linker. Above all, the most important matter about Linkers is the establishment of their truly resolved soul, or Atman. Without it, it is possible for attacks directed at a magically linked target to return towards the Linker.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000790	$For this reason, Linkers differ from other mages in which they must remember to use their magically established self as a tool. Particularly, when you must face other Linkers, your Atman is even more important.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000791	$Congratulations again on receiving this book. The fact that you were able to find this book means that you have successfully found some sort of link between the visible world and the invisible world. Consequently, if you experience difficulty searching for a magical linkage point within a group of targets hereafter, it'll become easier to cast away insincerity.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000793	Kadumel Era Armor {/}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000794	{nl}{nl}Vidotas Winterspoon
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000795	{nl}{nl}10 years have passed since I began my research. Now, exactly 30 years after the civil war, I finally have results to show.{nl}Although the purpose of this research is to satisfy my small curiosity, if the scope were to be broadened, it may prove beneficial to the Winterspoon family.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000796	Anyway, after spending a long time searching every nook and cranny for information about Ruklys and his followers, I reached a conclusion.{nl}*These notes were compiled after the... from King Kadumel's troops/army/men..., on the assumption that there are no contradictions.*{nl}During the period when the civil war took place, there weren't any significant differences between the King's army and rebel army.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000797	Both sides had armaments of comparable quality.{nl} King Kadumel's army outnumbered the rebel army, but the fortress and surrounding city (now called Petrified City) was a favourable position to be situated in.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000798	Many of the attackers had to attack through a funnel, is my conclusion.{nl}These tactics reduced the numerical advantage from 10-to-1 to 3-to-1. *Ruklys intended to make a heroic defence in the fortress*, The likelihood of victory is not great, even with 20 times the amount of troops. A theory commonly accepted by military scholars.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000799	King Kadumel had a numerical advantage in troops, but other factors involved are just as important.{nl}A significant difference, for example, is how wars are fought now compared to a thousand years ago.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000800	There have been many advances in military science, but the changes created by the development of the magical academy is incomparable. Warfare with magicians as combatants add a lot more elements for commanders to consider.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000801	This was the key difference between the armies of Ruklys and King Kadumel.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000802	If one side had magicians whereas the other side did not, the difference between troops and equipment is meaningless. It is estimated that the number of magicians in King Kadumel's army was substantial.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000803	*Although Ruklys's mentor was against fighting an army that has a considerable number of magicians, the war could not be avoided.*
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000804	Typically, the number of soldiers and their equipment greatly influences the tide of battle; however, with the inclusion of magicians, such was not the case as it turns out during the civil war.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000805	This phenomenon creates some issues to how the past was analyzed. If King Kadumel had not properly utilized the magicians, then it would be his folly and incompetence. As for the exceptional bravery Ruklys demonstrated, there may be another explanation to it.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000806	
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000807	The purpose of the research is to examine why magic was not effective in the battle against Ruklys and his followers.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000808	In other words, it's a possibility that Ruklys's forces were armed with Mana Metal powerful enough to negate the magical attacks of magicians.{nl}At first, this may sound absurd.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000809	The fact that a metal, Mana Metal, with such high resistance against magic exists is strange, but if such a metal does exist, then there couldn't have been enough to make more than one set of armor. The commander, Ruklys, would have been the only one wearing such an armor, otherwise it wouldn't make sense if the Mana Metal were distributed to that many of his troops.{nl}It is just as reasonable that the opposite was true.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000810	If one were to write about this, he/she can think of an objection to this immediately.{nl}In order to support this claim, one would need to find evidence of such a phenomena.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000811	
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000812	However, the Mana Metal Ruklys collected did not have such a weakness.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000813	Upon visiting the location of the fortress, my conclusion was proven correct. Pieces of the Mana Metal were found. I believe that they were used in battle. My hypothesis is that a small amount of the Mana Metal is sufficient to protect against the Kings' magician's wide area magic spells.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000814	
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000815	Judging from the clues discovered, Ruklys should have been wearing magic resistant armor at the time.{nl}{nl}Combined with other clues during that period of time, the armor Ruklys was wearing must have been produced using a large amount of Mana Metal.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002996	$This story is said to have taken place one day at the Tower of Stars.{nl}A dispute among the disciples of Lydia Schaffen broke out.{nl}Several disciples gathered after the training and in the process such a dialog is said to have come up: 'No matter how good your bow is, if your skills are lacking, you can't bring out its full potential. Therefore, what is important in the end is your own skill.'{nl}Such was a claim of a certain disciple, which started the dispute.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002997	$'You are forgetting the basics of Archery. What is an Archer? It is someone who uses a tool called a bow, right?{nl}Do you think an Archer existing without a bow is possible? {nl}Even if one gets famous for their skill with sword and spear, can one still call themselves an Archer? In the end, Archery is the concept of depending on tools, isn't it?'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002998	$The disciple who had a different view argued back:{nl}'You said tools are important, let's talk about that.{nl}What is a bow? There are various weapons for an Archer. Just like there are weapons that don't need much skill to handle, like a crossbow, there are also weapons, effectiveness of which varies a lot based on a user's skill, like the ones of the Wugushi.{nl}The Wind Arrow of the Wugushi is hard to master, it's a difficult weapon to wield for someone without an experience, no matter how good the materials of one's bow are.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_002999	$This is the same as saying that since people will die if they don't eat, their lives are less important than food and depend on it.{nl}Are you claiming that since you eat to be able to live on, you are living to eat?'{nl}Upon that, another disciple shared his viewpoint:{nl}'You are arguing about the Path of the Archer, but you are only concentrating on one aspect.{nl}What you fail to address is that no matter how famous an Archer one is, no matter how eagle-eyed one is, what they are using to their advantage is the wind. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003000	$The arrow could not be shot if it wasn't for the wind and air that carries it to the mark, how could any sharpshooter exist, or rather, how much would an Archer be able to do in that case? In the end, what is necessary for an Archer is to sense the wind flow and to be able to act on it.'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003001	$Lydia Schaffen continued eating while listening to the disciples, keeping her position on the railing. After they finished, she kept quiet for a while, but before long she fiddled with her fingers through the pile of shells of chestnuts she had eaten and picked out something, reportedly saying this: {nl}'What is this?'{nl}The disciple with the sharp eyes answered before anyone could.{nl}'It's the inner skin of a chestnut (kr: bo-nee).'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003002	$It was very obvious that it was indeed the inner skin of a chestnut, so the others nodded in agreement and waited for their master's next words. {nl}And so Lydia Schaffen continued. {nl}'No. This is the notch (kr: o-nee) of my arrow.'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003003	$One day Lydia Schaffen left a certain village alone and walked around at night.{nl} Lydia Schaffen saw a traveler sitting wearily at the roadside on a woodland road. {nl} Out of curiosity, she decided to approach him.{nl} 'Why are you sitting here in the forest in the middle of the night?'{nl}The traveler was hesitant to answer at first, but after being asked multiple times he finally opened his mouth. {nl}The reason was apparently this: {nl}

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003005	$'Of course, a game to see who is better with a bow would not be that interesting. Therefore, let's play a game where you fire an arrow at a target, and then I will try to catch and ride the arrow before it reaches the target,' said Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}Lydia replied, questioning the proposal: 'Ride an arrow?'{nl}'That is correct,' averred Rumpelstiltskin.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003006	$Upon answering, Rumpelstiltskin started to shrink his body.{nl} Once he had reduced himself to the size of a child's fist, Rumpelstiltskin spoke: 'Well, this size will allow me to ride your arrow, right?'{nl}Lydia Schaffen thought for a bit,{nl}'There is a problem with that, though. If you touch the arrow and cause it to fall to the ground without it ever hitting the target, then wouldn't that still be a loss for me regardless of whether you rode the arrow or not?'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin answered her with these words.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003007	$'Then how about this. I win if I can ride your arrow until it reaches the target.'{nl} 'And if your arrow falls to the ground,' he continued, 'then we both lose.'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin added, 'The game shall have three rounds, best two out of three.'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003008	$After Rumpelstiltskin's seemingly honest answer, Lydia Schaffen replied, 'Alright, one more thing: I'm going to shoot at any target, in any direction. I'll tell you what the target is each round. This way, you won't be able to get used to it for rounds two and three. Are you okay with this?{nl}'Alright, let's do that,' agreed Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}After also agreeing upon terms of defeat, the game between two people, err, one person and one demon began.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003009	$Lydia Schaffen weighed her arrow, then called out the first target:{nl}'The tallest brown tree over there!'{nl}With those words, she released the arrow and it sliced through the air at a frightful speed{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003010	$Rumpelstiltskin moved nimbly to chase the flying arrow, and after he got on, the arrow impaled the tree. As the arrow continued to oscillate, he danced to the rhythm of the oscillation and sang an unknown tune.{nl}Lydia Schaffen again gauged her arrows, then she called:{nl}'All of the cones on that pine tree on my front-left side!'{nl}Upon calling the target, Lydia Schaffen unleashed her godlike Archery skills. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003011	$'So there, I managed to sit on every single arrow before the last arrow reached the target. I win.'{nl} Lydia Schaffen replied,{nl}' Certainly, I can't deny the fact you sat on every arrow before the last one reached its target.'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003012	$Rumpelstiltskin gave a wicked grin after hearing Lydia Schaffen's words and said,{nl}'Meaning, I won this game. Now, as for the penalty we agreed on…'{nl}Before Rumpelstiltskin could finish, Lydia Schaffen shook her head and spoke,{nl}'Don't tell me that because you won two rounds, you won't play the final round? It's not acceptable, we clearly promised to play three rounds anyway, didn't we?'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003013	$'The game doesn't end before the third round, so I think it's pointless to talk about penalties before the game has actually ended…'{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003014	$Recognizing that he has already won two rounds and had no reason to refuse a third, as well as the fact the game was certainly not over yet, Rumpelstiltskin had no choice but to abide by Lydia Schaffen's words.{nl}And so the final round began, Lydia Schaffen gauged her last arrow, and called out as she pulled the bowstring back:{nl}'My target is… the moon in the sky!'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin side-saddled the arrow as soon as it left the bowstring, and not before long, he realized what he heard.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150729_003015	$Just as Rumpelstiltskin, grinding his teeth, was about to open his mouth, Lydia Schaffen said,{nl}'For the game to end, you need to ride the arrow until it arrives at its target. The game cannot end before then. If you manage to touched the moon and come back, then I will definitely accept the penalty.'{nl}Having said so, Lydia Schaffen began walking away as Rumpelstiltskin watched, grinding his teeth once again, unable to change the course of the game.
