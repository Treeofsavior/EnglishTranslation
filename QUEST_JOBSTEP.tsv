QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000503	The curse in this jewel is calling Tutu here.{nl}While I handle this curse somehow, there is something that you should do.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000504	First, tell the Krivis Master to prepare the memorial service.{nl}After that, please go to the eastern forest of Siaulai and block Tutu.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000505	This thing could happen when the power of the curse gets stronger.{nl}Our mission is to stop that.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000506	Yes. In fact, that jewel is the one that a young priest from the village picked up.{nl}After he brought this jewel, he suffered from nightmares so I made a request to Bokor Master.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000507	Okay anyways. I will prepare the memorial service.{nl}Don't worry about it and just block Tutu from the eastern forest of Siaulai before it comes to Klaipeda.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000508	This thing happens since the world is in chaos.{nl}The goddess must feel sad about it...
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000509	I was able to deal with it cleverly because of your help.{nl}As a Bokor, I can expect your growth from now on.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000511	Return to the Bokor Master fast and tell her about it.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000513	I want you to get the perfumed oil for the maintenance of the statue first.{nl}If you ask the priests, they will give it to you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000514	This is the perfumed oil.{nl}Since Tesla is too old, I was worried that my request may be too much, but i guess it's alright now.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000515	This is all I have..{nl}I heard the Krivis Master also has some.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000516	Perfumed Oil? Ah, here it is.{nl}Please take care of the statue.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000520	Even if you receive perfumed oil from the Priest Master, it may not be enough.{nl}Since you should take care of it with the greatest care.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000521	The amount of perfumed oil you have seems a bit lacking.{nl}Since the Bokor Master also has some oil, why don't you go meet him?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000522	Perfumed Oil? we will definitely give it to you.{nl}Tesla told us that he doesn't need any pay for that, so we felt sorry about it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000523	Too bad I can't go with you since I don't have enough time.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000524	The statues that we intrusted to you is the statue in Fedimian and the statue in Klaipeda.{nl}Okay then, I am counting on you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000525	If you use the absolute power of the goddess, you may get to Fedimian a little easier.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000526	Well done.{nl}Go back to Tesla.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000527	It is also a task of a Divdirbys to take care for the work besides creating the work.{nl}Don't forget about thie feeling if you want to learn the skills of Divdirbys.{nl}{nl}Oh, you came back already. {nl}Well done. {nl}

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000546	Fire Pot? Of course I know of it.{nl}But you know I am a merchant. If you could get me the hardened oil from the monsters at Starving Demon's Road...
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000547	If you don't need it, then I am also good with it.{nl}Since I am busy, I will just do my work.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000548	Oh, Thank you.{nl}A monster called Mostem keeps his hands on the fire pot at all times.{nl}

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000570	Instead of bragging about yourself in words, it's much better to show others that you are competent.{nl}I will give you a test. Defeat slimy Reaverpedes at Remaining Tree Dale.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000571	The Reaverpedes at Remaining Tree Dale would fit your reputation.{nl}I've heard your name enough, but I should check with my own eyes.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000580	If you want to learn my magic, I should first understand your skills.{nl}The Reaverpedes at Remaining Tree Dale would be enough.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000584	That attitude is what I wanted.{nl}I will teach you the true magic if you defeat Ironbaum at the western forest of Siaulai.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000585	Especially the attitude of the Cryomancer really...pisses me off.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000587	Ironbaum is running around at the eastern forest of Siaulai rignt now.{nl}But, the Chronomancer Master is not doing anything about it.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000588	I know it is little ridiculous to ask a favor to a person whom has come to learn my magic, but I have no other choice.{nl}I want you to defeat Ironbaum to teach him a lesson.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000589	Klaipeda may fall into danger, but he only cares about his safety. That's pathetic.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000592	Do I have to face against those weak monsters?{nl}If you can take care of them, I will teach you the magic of the Choronomancer.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000593	It's called an Ironbaum, it is at the western forest of Siaulai.{nl}Even if I am not interested in it, I can't help listening since I also have ears.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000595	I have a request that I don't want to lose to the Linker Master.{nl}If you could take care of that request on behalf of me, I will teach you how to control your energy. How about it?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000596	It is not that hard.{nl}You just have to defeat the Beowolf that is walking around this mine village.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000598	That's nice!{nl}Leave the Linker Master and let's talk about energy in details.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000607	I can still picture the faces of the other masters.{nl}Not only that, I am also happy to get a good disciple.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000608	It doesn't make sense to stay in a safe place as a master when there are hordes of monsters.{nl}I thought that isn't right so I ran from Fedimian.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000609	I heard that Necrobenter appeared again at the old garden of the goddess.{nl}If you dream to be a sorcerer, I hope you follow my request.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000614	You are better than I expected.{nl}But, the magic to control time is really hard so you should prepare for it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000615	Long time no see. You want to be an Alchemist.{nl}I should test if you are worthy enough to be an Alchemist.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000616	Good.{nl}Please defeat the Beowolf that is making a mess around here.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000617	It is not hard to learn the knowledge of an Alchemmist.{nl}You can learn the basics, such as decomposition of an element and synthesis, slowly.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000640	Clerics help others to reach a higher stage.{nl}To cure other people, please get me the green ointment from the Vubbes at the first floor of the crystal mine.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000641	The goddess told me to help you around.{nl}By helping others near you, you will help your spirit as well.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000642	I think I can relieve the pains of many patients with this.{nl}As a cleric master, I will help you contribute more to the goddess.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000643	Defeat the bats at the first floor of the crystal mine and bring me their wings as a proof.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000644	If you can give us the blessing of the cure, you will reach even closer to the goddess.{nl}By helping others, I will help you reach a higher stage of Cleric.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000645	Lots of people come here after receiving injuries from monsters.{nl}But since I ran out of the herbs, we have no choice but to only give first aid to the patients.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000646	Thanks.{nl}As a cleric master, I will help you accomplish a higher mission.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000647	The number of people who are hurt due to the attacks from the monsters keep increasing, but we don't have enough herbs.{nl}Please bring wild flower alcohol from Lonesome Marketplace for them.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000648	{nl}Maybe I can help you, but you must know what real battels feel like before you receive lessons from me.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000649	You can find Honeypins when you go to the forest.{nl}They will be a good experience for you at the moment.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000650	You should train hard and experience real battles, but do not forget the word, careful.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000651	Good. I can see that you are much better now.{nl}If you want to learn, please come often.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000652	Your heroic stories are good lessons for us, Peltastas.{nl}But, I should check you myself before accepting you as my disciple.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000653	Stories are always exaggerated.{nl}So forgive me for acting so picky.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000654	It was not an exaggeration.{nl}Since your skill has been proven, I will accept you learning the lessons of Peltasta.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000655	The only thing you can trust in real battles is your experience.{nl}If you want to learn the swordsmanship of Highlander, it will be good to accumulate more experience.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000656	There is a monster called Honeypin at the forest.{nl}Facing that monster will be a good experience.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000657	Well done.{nl}You will become a good swordsman if you gain more experience and learn from me.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000658	To be called a Hoplite, You should act well so everyone can trust and rely on you.{nl}Your skills are already famous here, but I want to check them with my own eyes.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000659	There's a monster called Collimencia at Forest of Incremental Rocks. {nl}It is a threatening monster, but you should defeat it easily.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000660	I thought this would take you more time, you are better than I thought.{nl}I am counting on you as a colleague.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000661	It is strange that a skillful person like you will learn from me.{nl}But, there is a cost to any learning.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000662	I heard the Poatas at Forest of Incremental Rocks attack people.{nl}It would be more than enough if you could defeat them.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000663	So I guess it was dealt with easilly.{nl}Good. You are qualified.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000664	If you want to learn from me, you must first show me your skills.{nl}I think Collimencia at Forest of Incremental Rocks would be more than enough.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000665	You should become strong to become an example for others. Don't you think so?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000666	Good. You skills are enough.{nl}I am happy to teach you,.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000667	If you want to be a Cataphract, you should be able to defeat Gaigalas at Flowerless Forest.{nl}Come back after defeating it.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000669	You are more than I expected.{nl}Good. Let's continue our good relationship.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000670	I am sorry, but I am too busy to accept you at the moment.{nl}I heard someone saw our family's symbol, which was lost on the Medis Diena, so I am looking for it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000671	I am the only one left in the Legwyn Family so each symbol is important to me.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000672	This... is the symbol of Legwyn Family.{nl}Thanks. As I promised you, I will help you reach a higher level.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000673	If you want to learn from me, it is courtesy to show your own skills first. {nl}Honeypins at Deep Indigo Forest would be enough. 
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000674	For me, the life of a pirate is fighting, stealing, fighting again, and stealing again.{nl}My fellows, drink up!
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000675	Very reliable.{nl}Good. I will teach you my skills from now on.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000676	If you want to learn something from me, defeat Gaigalas at Flowerless Forest.{nl}If you want to be acknowledged in terms of both your determination and skills.{nl}{nl}

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000678	I will recognize your skills as I promised you. {nl}Follow me. I will open the way of the Doppelsoeldner for you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000679	I would be able to check your skills by checking whether or not you are able to defeat Gaigalas at Flowerless Forst. {nl}I wish you the best luck.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000680	.. I guess there's no other way. I think I would be able to test you with this.{nl}I heard there's a person who saw Poata swallowing the crest in Forest of Incremental Rocks.{nl}Okay then, I am counting on you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000681	I lost an important divine object of Krivis.{nl}If you want to reach a higher stage of Krivis, I will help you find the divine object again.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000682	There is a strong power within the divine objects so lots of monsters are going after it for themselves.{nl}Losing a divine object is like losing a faith.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000683	Well done. Fortunately, the divine object is okay.{nl}I will teach you the training of Krivis as I promised you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000684	I hear that vicious energy has been coming from Ruklys Street lately.{nl}If you want to walk the way of a Priest, you should exorcise it in the name of the goddess.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000685	The vicious energy is really evil.{nl}But I am sure you will be able to exorcise the energy in Ruklys Street.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000686	This is an important divine object that was being transferred to Klaipeda.{nl}I heard that they were attacked while they were walking on the main street of Petrified City.{nl}I am counting on you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000687	I am sorry, but the way of Bokor can't be explored by just anyone.{nl}If you could bring me the essence of the petrified whale that appears in Lonesome Marketplace, I will acknowledge your skill.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000688	The petrified whale at Lonesome Marketplace has killed many lives.{nl}I need the essence that has the resentment from them in it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000689	Well done.{nl}I will teach you everything about Bokor as promised.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000690	If I could obtain solid wood from the main street of Petrified City, I would be able to accept any request...{nl}For example, the lesson of Dievdirbys.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000691	That is my lifelong wish.{nl}That tree always gestures towards me to make itself into a masterpiece.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000692	Oh. That's it.{nl}You can come to me anytime you want to learn the lessons of Dievdirbys!
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000693	There is a rumor that many people who have crossed Ruklys Street are suffering from nightmares.{nl}If you want to walk the way of Sadhu, you shall help them.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000694	When you eliminate the source, the nightmares will be gone.{nl}Please go to Ruklys Street and eliminate the source.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000696	I heard enough about you, that you have a firm religious belief.{nl}But I want to check it with my own eyes.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000697	Forgive me. I am being picky since this task is in the name of Paladin.{nl}I think Rajapearl at Lonesome Marketplace would be enough for your name.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000698	Prove your religious belief.{nl}There's nothing to be worried about. The goddess will protect you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000699	You have done well.{nl}With this, your religious belief is proven, so I will accept you to learn my lessons.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000700	Monk's training is very strict.{nl}If you still want to receive training, go to the central district and defeat Repus to bring it's toe nails.{nl}If you could complete that, I will acknowledge you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000701	Our training is very harsh. {nl}You should at least defeat Repus at the central district to follow our training.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000702	Good. I will accept your determination.{nl}I always tell you, but our Monk training is really harsh.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000703	Insteand of an entrance test of Pardoner, there's something you should do for me. {nl}Please find the lost money of indulgence at Ruklys street. You can do it right?
