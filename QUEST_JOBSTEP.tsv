QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000404	I thought it would be difficult but you're great at it. {nl}I will teach you the skills slowly so better warm up first.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000405	You need to show your bravery if you want to learn from me. {nl}Use this note to provoke the monsters in Penitence Route. {nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000406	Are you brave enough to turn the enemy's blade to you when your allies are in danger?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000407	I can picture them full of anger. {nl}You've passed the test. You're good enough to learn from me.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000408	You want to learn from me? Then there's something you should do for me. {nl}Teach the Hackapell Master who believes that there's something in the world that can't be penetrated.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000412	I heard the other Masters are sending their disciples to defeat Yekub in the Cathedral. {nl}But that is what you must bring an end to. Go now.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000413	If you have the ability to learn from me, then Yekub will be easy enough.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000418	Squires are strong but helping our partners is where we shine. {nl}Using the rope to make connecting attacks with fellow allies {nl}is an attack that is notably stronger than any other attacks.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000420	In order for connecting attacks to succeed, nobody can make any mistakes. {nl}That is why you need to practice hard.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000421	How much are you used to it? {nl}I will teach you thoroughly as promised.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000422	I heard the monsters called Bitereginas keep threatening people at Sunset Flag Forest.{nl}If you could defeat these monsters, I will teach you my skills.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000423	Since I am a Master, I should also help other people, but I just don't have enough time.{nl}Anyway, as I promised to you, I will teach you my skills.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000425	The Peltastas requested help. {nl}We have limited troops but we also can't reject the Peltastas as we have a pledge with them.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000426	I want you to assist the Peltastas and carry out the mission.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000428	Ask the Highlanders what the problem is and if you can, please solve it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000429	If you say so, there is a way.{nl}If you could defeat the Moas at Crystal Brook that destroyed my ingredients, I will shift your turn ahead.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000430	I'm following the traces of Evoniphons.{nl}Recent information says that they tested something in the Cathedral.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000431	Go to the Cathedral right away and get a sample of Moya's fluid. {nl}We'll should know something after examining it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000432	I'll give you this flare since you're a novice. {nl}It'll help you find the monsters efficiently.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000433	Poison is like a blade with two sides, so you should be careful with it. {nl}Especially if you get a finger cut while using poison..
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000434	I assume you've come to learn something from me because you have the abilities. {nl}Something like winning a duel against me.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000435	Go to the vacant area above the stairs and wait. {nl}I'll be there after finishing this up.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000436	You're faster than you seem. {nl}I will teach you my skills from now on, so come anytime.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000440	With your abilities, the Riverpeded in Lonesome Market should be easy to defeat. {nl}If you can't clear that, I can't take you on as a Ranger apprentice.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000441	I'm relieved you're here. {nl}Everyone is focused there but only us Rangers are not dispatched.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000442	I heard you were a step faster than the Hunters. {nl}Good work. I'm very strict with teaching so better be prepared.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000443	Teaching you the skills of the Scouts isn't difficult. {nl}But you need to have the capability to follow it, don't you think?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000444	Alright then. {nl}Deadborn appeared in Ruklys Road but the troops there need help. {nl}This should be fairly good hunting material.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000445	Good job. You did better than I expected. {nl}Come by anytime if you want to learn something.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000446	So you want to learn Sapper skills from me? That's a good idea. {nl}I'm currently lacking materials for a new trap.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000447	So you will need to help me with it. {nl}You'll need to defeat Rocktortuga in Ruklys Memorial and bring me Natural Mano Stones.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000448	It's Rocktortuga of Ruklys Memorial. {nl}The Rocktortugas in other areas don't give Mano Stones.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000449	Alright. Got the Mano Stones..{nl}Come by anytime if you want to learn Sapper skills.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000450	You said you want to learn my skills?{nl}If you could bring me some burnable stones from Yonazolems' central district, I'll think about it.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000452	You have unreasonably great skills. {nl}I'd welcome a disciple like you. I shall teach you my skills.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000453	We enhance our immunity by experiencing lots of poisons.{nl}If you could survive from the poison of Rajatoads at the central district, then I will teach you how to control poisons as well.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000461	Allies? Support? Supply? No, a sword and a gun would be enough for me.{nl}They are the only things that I can trust.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000462	And one more thing. The hatred towards the enemies!{nl}If you wish to advance to Schwarze Reiter, you should remember that hatred.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000463	Because you won't be able to advance until you beat me.{nl}Come to me when you are prepared.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000466	I need to test if you are qualified to learn my skills. {nl}Defeating a Sparnas Horn seems fair enough for someone like you, what do you think?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000467	I heard Sparnas Horn is huge, so it spends most of its time on the ground than on air.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000468	I didn't expect you to defeat it. That's pretty good. {nl}Alright. You can come anytime you want to learn skills.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000469	I heard Minotaurs have shown up at Lonesome Maketplace.{nl}Please bring me the proof of your victory.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000475	Unfortunately, we're out of Nicotia that the Cleric Master is asking for. {nl}There was an urgent request so it had to be used.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000504	First, tell the Krivis Master to prepare the memorial service.{nl}After that, please go to the eastern forest of Siaulai and block Tutu.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000505	This thing could happen when the power of the curse gets stronger.{nl}Our mission is to stop that.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000506	Yes. In fact, that jewel is the one that a young priest from the village picked up.{nl}After he brought this jewel, he suffered from nightmares so I made a request to Bokor Master.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000507	Okay anyways. I will prepare the memorial service.{nl}Don't worry about it and just block Tutu from the eastern forest of Siaulai before it comes to Klaipeda.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000513	I want you to get the perfumed oil for the maintenance of the statue first.{nl}If you ask the priests, they will give it to you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000514	This is the perfumed oil.{nl}Since Tesla is too old, I was worried that my request may be too much, but i guess it's alright now.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000515	This is all I have..{nl}I heard the Krivis Master also has some.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000520	Even if you receive perfumed oil from the Priest Master, it may not be enough.{nl}Since you should take care of it with the greatest care.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000521	The amount of perfumed oil you have seems a bit lacking.{nl}Since the Bokor Master also has some oil, why don't you go meet him?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000522	Perfumed Oil? we will definitely give it to you.{nl}Tesla told us that he doesn't need any pay for that, so we felt sorry about it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000523	Too bad I can't go with you since I don't have enough time.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000524	The statues that we intrusted to you is the statue in Fedimian and the statue in Klaipeda.{nl}Okay then, I am counting on you.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000525	If you use the absolute power of the goddess, you may get to Fedimian a little easier.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000526	Well done.{nl}Go back to Tesla.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000527	It is also a task of a Divdirbys to take care for the work besides creating the work.{nl}Don't forget about thie feeling if you want to learn the skills of Divdirbys.{nl}{nl}Oh, you came back already. {nl}Well done. {nl}

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000587	Ironbaum is running around at the eastern forest of Siaulai rignt now.{nl}But, the Chronomancer Master is not doing anything about it.{nl}

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000589	Klaipeda may fall into danger, but he only cares about his safety. That's pathetic.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000607	I can still picture the faces of the other masters.{nl}Not only that, I am also happy to get a good disciple.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000608	It doesn't make sense to stay in a safe place as a master when there are hordes of monsters.{nl}I thought that isn't right so I ran from Fedimian.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000609	I heard that Necrobenter appeared again at the old garden of the goddess.{nl}If you dream to be a sorcerer, I hope you follow my request.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000616	Good.{nl}Please defeat the Beowolf that is making a mess around here.{nl}

xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000723	Even if someone becomes the world's greatest archer, consumption of arrows will always be a problem. {nl} Lydia Schaffen's bow was used with great care. However, Schaffen too, uses arrows. {nl} But unlike fired arrows, Her bow is permanent even with continued use.  {nl}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000724	Even if it was impossible to create arrows that can be used permanently, Lydia Schaffen delved into arrow making techniques. {nl} Getting materials neccesary to make arrows was another problem. {nl}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000725	Troubled greatly by this problem, Lydia Schaffen went on a journey to find the solution. {nl} Whether or not she had been granted blessing by the goddess when she met the Fletcher Master or if she found the solution to her problem, Historians will continue to debate about the topic. {nl}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000726	Many Fletchers had been produced ever since the dawn of time. But talentless numbers are irrelevant. {nl} People just call him the Fletcher Master, Lydia Schaffen too,was uncertain of his name. {nl}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000727	Ever since his rise to fame, People called him the Fletcher Master. People who knew his real name were swept away by the passings of the river of time. {nl} His real name, according to some scholars, was said to be John Blacksmith. but the name itself isn't getting any credibility, since you cannot readily accept a famous name that common. {nl}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000728	Anyway, Lydia Schaffen met this Fletcher Master who was an arrow expert. Lydia after overcoming her journey, was ready to learn. {nl} However, arrow making techniques by the Fletcher Master was a secret at that time, and in the years afterwards, a stuff among legends. {nl}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000729	However, even if you are the world's greatest archer, The Blessing of the goddess is important to learn the arrow making techniques of the Fletcher Master. {nl} Therefore only someone who has the blessing of the Goddess can be molded to create a Fletcher Master, like how Lydia Schaffen created new and consistent arrows. {nl}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000730	Another tale is of the Fletcher Master's secret to avoid combat according to the maker's manual is to hit with certainty somewhere in the spleen. {nl}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000731	The rapid production of arrows by the Fletcher Master is regarded to be his sole talent. However he may have a secret lying in wait somewhere in this world. {nl}

xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000744	{s35}{nl}The Notch of Lydia Schaffen{/}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000745	The change happened one day in the Tower of Stars. {nl} Controversy among the disciples of Lydia Schaffen broke out. {nl} "No matter how bad your weapon handling is, even if you cannot possibly be useful, as long as you have skills, you can improve!" {nl} The disciples debated against each other. {nl}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000746	"You are forgetting Archer basics! What is an Archer? Old Archers of lore used bow as a weapon.{nl} Does that mean that even if there's no bow, one can be called an archer? {nl} Even if people change their use of sword and spears, How could they become an archer? {nl}Eventually, The concept of being an archer depends on their weapons! {nl}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000747	The disciples who have different views argued with him. {nl} "Skill is also important when handling weaponry. {nl} Choosing range as an alternative means discarding a bow? The ability of people to use a crossbow as a weapon is dependent on weapon handling like how weapons are ineffective when amateurs use them against experienced Archers. {nl} Without examining the wind, arrows become useless, no matter how well-made it is. Difficult to use weapons like the bow is also difficult to master. {nl}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000748	If it is Crossbows or whatever, usage of discussed weapons is irrelevant. {nl} If it is weapon handling, as you have claimed, Old Archers fail in that regard.
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000749	Even if people die on food or not,Even if people don't live for food. People will always claim that they are dependent on food.{nl} Do you eat food to claim you're alive or are you alive because you eat food?" {nl} Then another anon gives his opinion about it to the disciples. {nl}"Methinks that this discussion about Archers and stuff lacks a very defining point" {nl} And that point, is as if it's from the tip of an arrow that misses the bull's eye. After all, all arrows use wind" {nl}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000750	If there is no wind and air to carry the arrow to the target even if the bow is superb and the bull's eye is present, The name bow would lose it's meaning. Ultimately, Checking wind movement is of tantamount importance to Archers, Having a connection everyday with the will of the wind." {nl}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000751	From then on, The disciples argued to no end, claims became more diverse and interesting, theories fired back and forth.{nl} Finally, They fell into wonder about what will their master, Lydia Schaffen think of this. {nl} So the disciples waited for their master's words about the conversation then promptly rushed to Lydia Schaffen individually. {nl}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000752	The disciples came to Lydia Schaffen. Afterwards, She is said to have been dangerously perched on the railing of the tower of stars, using an arrowhead to eat. {nl}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000753	Lydia Schaffen ate during nighttime. While having the right manners in front of his disciples as he listened to the repeated claims of her disciples. After a moment of silence, a collection of shells that can be eaten using fingers appeared in her lap, she raised one and asked.{nl} "What is this?" {nl} One of the disciples with good eyesight answered quickly. {nl} "'Tis a shell."{nl}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000754	It was obviously a seashell, so the disciples waited for their master's next words. {nl} Then, Lydia Schaffen added. {nl} "No. It is not. This is my notch." {nl}
xQUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000755	Lydia said that and then sandwiched the shell that she always eat at night between her fingers and fired into the sky a wrapped arrow using the heavy end of her bow. {nl} It is said that Lydia Schaffen liked to silence debates in strange ways, leaving her disciples bewildered as they came down the railings. {nl}
