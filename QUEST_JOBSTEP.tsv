QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000514	This is the perfumed oil.{nl}Since Tesla is too old, I was worried that my request may be too much, but i guess it's alright now.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000515	This is all I have..{nl}I heard Krivi Master also has some.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000520	Even if you receive perfumed oil from Priest Master, it may not be enough.{nl}Since you should take care for it with the greatest care.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000521	The amount of perfumed oil you have seems lacking a bit.{nl}Since Bokor Master also has the oil, why don't you go meet him?
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000522	Perfumed Oil? we will definitely give it to you.{nl}Tesla told us that he doesn't need any pay for that so we felt sorry about it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000523	Too bad I can't go with you since I don't have enough time.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000524	The statues that we requested to you are the statue in Fedimian and the statue in Klaipeda.{nl}Okay then, I am counting on you.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000565	As you know more about Linker, it is very interesting.{nl}Don't you think so? Reading the string of mana..
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000566	You possess great abilities indeed.{nl}As a linker, if I could lead you well, you will become a really powerful magician.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000567	Before you learn the magics of Thaumaturge, I need to test your magical skills.{nl}Defeat Burning Salamanders at Magicians' Tower.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000583	I don't know if those Masters really think about the safety of the goddess and the kingdom.{nl}Ironbaum is approaching Klaipeda, but no one is worried about it.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000584	That attitude is what I wanted.{nl}I will teach you the true magic if you defeat Ironbaum at the west forest of Siaulai.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000585	Especially the attitude of Creomancer really.. pisses me off.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000587	Ironbaum is running around at the east forest of Siaulai rignt now.{nl}But, Chronomancer Master is not doing anything about it.{nl}

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000589	Klaipeda may fall into a danger, but he only cares about his safety. That's pathetic.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000590	Well done.{nl}Creomancer Master woudn't stand and watch now since the Pyromancer trainee also stepped forward.{nl}Until then, let's talk about the fire magic slowly.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000591	The other masters are all blaming me.{nl}They told me that I am not doing anything even when those monsters are threatening Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000592	Do I have to face against those weak monsters?{nl}If you could take care of them, I will teach you the magic of Choronomancer.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000593	It's called an Ironbaum at the west forest of Siaulai.{nl}Even if I am not interested in it, I can't help resist listening since I also have ears.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000594	I wonder what Pyromancer Master would tell by looking at the laid down Ironbaum.{nl}I will teach you the magic of Chronomancer as I promised.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000595	I have a request that I don't want to lose to Linker Master.{nl}If you could take care of that request on behalf of me, I will teach you how to control the energy. How about it?

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000597	I had troubles for that a few times in the past.{nl}But if I have a disciple like you, I won't lose to Linker Master anymore.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000598	That's nice!{nl}Leave the Linker Master and let's talk about the energy in details.
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000599	If you want to learn about my magic, there is something that you should do for me.{nl}Defeat the Beowolf that appeared in the mine village quicker than Psychochino Master.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000608	It doesn't make sense to stay in the safe place as a master when there are full of monsters.{nl}I thought that's not right so I ran from Fedimian.{nl}
QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000609	I heard that Necrobenter appeared again at the old garden of the goddess.{nl}If you dream to be a sorcerer, I hope you follow my request.

QUEST_JOBSTEP_20150317_000614	You are more than I expected.{nl}But, the magic to control time is really hard so you should prepare for it.
