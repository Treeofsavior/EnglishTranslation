ITEM_20151022_007276	Plague Doctor Helmet
ITEM_20151022_007277	Ever since the very first Paladin did, many people throughout the ages have guarded the Tenet Church. All those years of accumulated experience have been drawn upon to create this combination of power and convenience.
ITEM_20151022_007278	Most attempts at keeping plants in check with other plants after Medzio Diena have failed, but after the ability to drain the energy of plant monsters of a certain fern was discovered, it has been applied to weapons.
ITEM_20151022_007279	Equipment specialized against beast monsters have developed due to the environment of the Lucas Region. It is rare for a region to be as untouched by the Great Plant Cataclysm as Lucas, and this scarcity became the basis on which this equipment was produced.
ITEM_20151022_007280	It is uncommon for Kingdom fortresses to be built with wood or dirt. As such, it is a nuisance in strongly fortified regions when the stones or minerals that form castles become monsters and thus require effective weaponry when such incidents occur.
ITEM_20151022_007281	Agailla Flurry decided to leave one recipe in celebration of completing the epitaph. The recipe, which was all but forgotten for hundreds of years after her death, was only reevaluated after Medzio Diena. Only now the effectiveness of Flurry's recipe against insects is being highlighted.
ITEM_20151022_007282	The exact origins and creator of this weapon recipe are unknown. Some speculate that it was created by a nameless master, but most experts think that it was created incognito by someone famous due to certain circumstances.
ITEM_20151022_007283	One does not have to be a priest to embark on a pilgrimage. As long as they look up to the goddess and are on pilgrimage, it matters not if they are mage, archer, or of other professions. Of course, it helps if the weapon they are used to is threatening to demons.
ITEM_20151022_007284	In a certain period of history, the Istora region was famous as a retirement place for scholars. There was a temporary exchange of various academics in the region achieving new inventions and discoveries. The Istora Sword is one of those achievements.
ITEM_20151022_007285	The aim of the sacred pact centered around the Tenet Church is the eventual defeat of the Demon Queen. It is said that the creators of this sword prayed that it would be able to gravely wound the Demon Queen.
ITEM_20151022_007286	Magical application of the stealing energy from competing plants and secretion of harmful substances to weapons is a very difficult task. The fact that it succeeded in less than three years shows the urgency of the situation.
ITEM_20151022_007287	Regions with relatively less plant growth after Medzio Diena saw an increase in beast activity. This equipment is the result of such regional developments.
ITEM_20151022_007288	The stones and other material used to build the 3 layer castle wall near the capital rarely mutated into monsters. This was thanks to precautions against various catastrophies dating back to the founding of the kingdom. However, castles in other regions did not have such measures and now require weapons against monsters after Medzio Diena.
ITEM_20151022_007289	Agailla Flurry devised a magical weapon that had two advantages in which a non-mage could use it and would exhibit it's true value after Medzio Diena. However, it is still uncertain if she foresaw Medzio Diena.
ITEM_20151022_007290	There is a theory that even those who like to throw wild guesses approach with caution. The theory that the original creator of the Krag Sword, based on the techniques applied and when it was first produced, is Ruklys.
ITEM_20151022_007291	Despite the goddesses interacting with humans in numerous places, it was only natural for the places where they had been or performed miracles to overlap or converge. The production and spreading of goods for those people was inevitable.
ITEM_20151022_007292	According to certain radicalists, Istora weapons are said to utilize source energy of goddesses. There is no definate proof to their claims.
ITEM_20151022_007293	The aim of the sacred pact centered around the Tenet Church is the eventual defeat of the Demon Queen. The development of easy to handle weapons that are deadly to demons is only reasonable.
ITEM_20151022_007294	The application of plant regulation effects based on plants on to blunt weapons is even more difficult. It may weaken the weapon before being used on an enemy.
ITEM_20151022_007295	The Lukas Rod is one of the earliest applied examples of magic being used to fight beasts in this region.
ITEM_20151022_007296	Weapons made from weaker materials must be empowered with stronger magic as many Mutant-type monsters are relatively robust.
ITEM_20151022_007297	Insect monsters before Medzio Diena were few and less ferocious. Those were the good old days where a mage could make do with a simple magically enhanced weapon.
ITEM_20151022_007298	The people who support the Ruklys origin theory of this weapon say that Ruklys created them in order to give them to his diverse followers. The people that oppose the theory say that although Ruklys is indeed a talented warrior, he lacks the broad experience needed create different weapons.
ITEM_20151022_007299	Demons were the largest obstacle for pilgrims even before Medzio Diena. These weapons had become a dependable method of defense for pilgrims that could not afford bodyguards.
ITEM_20151022_007300	The opinion that Istora weapons are linked to divine power originating from the goddesses instead of magic or natural power is refuted by the fact that the weapon demonstrates its abilities against Mutant-type monsters.
ITEM_20151022_007301	The bowcrafters were once proud that their bow was created in an independent way and had nothing to do with the Astral Tower.
ITEM_20151022_007302	To craft this bow requires the effort of waiting for the moment a fern blooms at a special time in a place nobody can see. As a matter of fact, all magic that changes the life of a fern into death has roots in such custom rituals.
ITEM_20151022_007303	According to some, this weapon reacts to the unique scents of animals.
ITEM_20151022_007304	Projectile weapons must be crafted so the body itself becomes the magic source and continuously transfers energy and makes it so that the user does not need to be involved directly in the process. It is better if the weapon can recover magic on it's own instead of having to put in ample amounts of magic.
ITEM_20151022_007305	According to some, Agailla Flurry said that even Demon Lord Diena would have been easily defeated if this bow had been in the hands of Lydia Schaffen. Of course it would not be completely ineffective even in the hands of someone else.
ITEM_20151022_007306	Some say that the reason there is no record of Lydia Schaffen evaluating this bow is because the bow and the recipe did not exist at the time. They say that it is unlikely that, given her personality, there would not be any criticism if the recipe existed during Ruklys. Therefore, they argue that all of these Krag items are later designs.
ITEM_20151022_007307	Even weapons as light as bows can deal enormous amounts of damage to Mutant-type monsters. If they are Istora weapons.
ITEM_20151022_007308	The Tenet Crossbow is the most recently designed and produced weapon by the Tenet Church members.
ITEM_20151022_007309	Before Medzio Diena, the ritual of watching the ferns blooming was thought to been for fulfilling wishes or good luck, but all aspects of human life have completely changed since then.
ITEM_20151022_007310	This weapon reacts to the slightest movement of the target after hitting it. However, only the finest movement is required making the delay almost non-exinstant.
ITEM_20151022_007311	Not all Philis weaponry was crafted based on the same magic. In this case, the projectile damages the cause behind the mutation instead of containing magic harmful to the monsters.
ITEM_20151022_007312	Scholars must receive some credit for the resurgence of Flurry's recipe after Medzio Diena. Their tireless exploration and the advancements in epigraphy were some of the reasons the recipe was revitalized and how the weapon could be realized at an opportune moment.
ITEM_20151022_007313	The Krag Crossbow is mainly thought to have appeared in Lydia Schaffen's latter years thanks to her records. However, some say that it had existed before that time but had not been mentioned by her.
ITEM_20151022_007314	The Pilgrim Crossbow was the weapon of choice for pilgrims that were better off. It is only human nature to want to be able to attack from further and more easily than you can with a magic rod.
ITEM_20151022_007315	The Istora region was once famous as a retirement place for scholars and thanks to their intercourse, saw many discoveries and inventions that are still being improved to this day. In the case of the Istora crossbow, that improvement happened after Medzio Diena.
ITEM_20151022_007316	The Tenet Mace is the base of all weaponry related to the Tenet Church. It existed since the first Paladin and is the first weapon which was infused with magic that would later be used on other weapons.
ITEM_20151022_007317	Some say that the goddesses had hidden mysterious powers in ferns long ago, and think that is why fern observing rituals before Medzio Diena and applying power to weapons after Medzio Diena is possible. No in depth research has been done by theologians or priests despite the ritual being ancient.
ITEM_20151022_007318	Wild animals are frequently encountered enemies for novices and pilgrims. They must be tamed by magic if they cannot be swayed by the goddesses.
ITEM_20151022_007319	Some priests think that weapons used against Mutant-type monsters should be crafted with diverse materials. The complicated process of metal reinforcement, filling it with divine energy and infusion of magic are applied simultaneously to this weapon.
ITEM_20151022_007320	Recipes for maces have been passed through time without being lost. The main reason behind this is because there is a strong atmosphere considering anything related to the legends Maven amongst priests. Thanks to that atmosphere, there were records of Flurry's recipe allowing it to utilized.
ITEM_20151022_007321	Some believe the weapon has the power to break boulders because of the name.
ITEM_20151022_007322	It is the weapon of choice for priests when starting a pilgrimage. Whatever the reason may be, there is a definate tendency amongst priests to be comfortable with and prefer maces.
ITEM_20151022_007323	Opinions are emerging saying that scholars should also help resolve the catastrophies Medzio Diena brought as artifacts such as the Istora Mace are being brought back into the light.
ITEM_20151022_007324	It is difficult to infuse magic to separable weaponry. It is also hard for ordinary people to figure out if the magic used to fight demons is infused in the shaft or head of spears.
ITEM_20151022_007325	The magic symbol Koru is hidden on this spear in the form of a fern sprout. Sprouts have long been symbols of great religious import.
ITEM_20151022_007326	It is inadvisable to use this weapon for hunting even though it may cause greater damage to beasts. It has always been safer to rely on traps and snares when hunting.
ITEM_20151022_007327	It is said that masters of this weapon can remove it from monsters after throwing it from a great distance and attack with it again. Some however point out that this combat style is inefficient.
ITEM_20151022_007328	Unfortunately, parts of the Escanciu Spear recipe have been lost. However, substituting the unknown ingredients with others based on different weapons still created the desired effects. The only problem is that it is unkown if they are the ingredients that Flurry first thought of.
ITEM_20151022_007329	There is no doubt that this weapon is a great help in hunting monsters no matter the circumstances that caused the creator to hide behind the name Krag.
ITEM_20151022_007330	Wild animals are as much of an obstacle to pilgrims as demons. The spear used to be chosen as it is effective against both enemies, requires less care than projectile weapons and can also be used as a cane.
ITEM_20151022_007331	According to some theories, the Istora Spear had an original form unlike different Istora weapons which became the roots on which other Istora weaponry was invented.
ITEM_20151022_007332	It was crafted with the durability to withstand charging Mutant-type monsters.
ITEM_20151022_007333	Insectoid monsters occasionally attack from the air. Therefore, users of this weapon must prepare against air attacks from insectoid monsters.
ITEM_20151022_007334	The largest weakness of theory that Krag weapons were crafted by Ruklys is that it cannot explain the fact that the weapon would not be named as such if it had been crafted prior to the betrayal, and that there would not have been enough time to craft it afterwards.
ITEM_20151022_007335	A weapon that clearly shows that pilgrams truly come from all walks of life. Those that are not afraid of becoming burdens may opt to choose this weapon.
ITEM_20151022_007336	The Istora Pike is said to be the first Istora weapon to be crafted from methods discovered from the Istora Spear.
ITEM_20151022_007337	Weapons based on the Tenet Church were not all conceived at the same time. The staff was crafted relatively late when compared to it's simplicity, and was completed when efforts to maintain different ingredients that have different magic retention times succeeded.
ITEM_20151022_007338	Death was already immanent within the rapid growth behind the explosive increase of plants. It draws as near as life force is used for rapid growth and magic gained from ferns has the same effect on plants.
ITEM_20151022_007339	Though it may seem contradictory, the people that assited the most in crafting this weapon to be effective against beasts are people that had professions related to the care of animals.
ITEM_20151022_007340	Infusing magic against Mutant-type monsters is more difficult than one may think. It must repress the tendency of objects trying to mutate after Medzio Diena as well as being susceptible to magic as a weapon.
ITEM_20151022_007341	Some theorize that the reason Agailla Flurry thought of crafting a weapon effective against insectoid monsters is because nobody had bothered to do so before her.
ITEM_20151022_007342	Those that support the Ruklys origin theory say that the name was changed as he had been declared as a traitor. However, they cannot explain why the name Krag was chosen.
ITEM_20151022_007343	There are numerous locations in the kingdom which contain legends and stories of the goddesses as they have been with us for a long time. It is only natural for there to be pilgrims traveling to those locations and seek measures to make it a safer journey.
ITEM_20151022_007344	There are some that believe that Mutant-type monsters receive more damage from Istora weapons because they are go against the laws of nature.
ITEM_20151022_007345	 - All Cryomancer skills level +2{nl}  - 15% chance to inflict [Freeze] on an enemy for 3 seconds when attacking with an Ice property skill
ITEM_20151022_007346	Training Revolver
ITEM_20151022_007347	Thanks to the resurgence in Istora weaponry, some scholars in the Istora region have invented radically new weapons. This weapon is a representative sample.
ITEM_20151022_007348	Epee
ITEM_20151022_007349	Training Rapier
ITEM_20151022_007350	Aston Rapier
ITEM_20151022_007351	Sharp Rapier
ITEM_20151022_007352	Duelist
ITEM_20151022_007353	 - All Fencer skills level +1
ITEM_20151022_007354	Venier
ITEM_20151022_007355	- All Fencer skills level +2{nl} - 3% chance of inflicting additional Holy property damage
ITEM_20151022_007356	Long ago, a goddess suggested the crafting of objects to the other goddesses. Most of the goddesses that heeded their colleague's suggestion mainly did so out of amusement, but the goddess that suggested it meant to leave the objects containing the divine powers of the goddesses in the world for the generations to come. One of those arrangements are these gloves
ITEM_20151022_007357	A long time ago, several goddesses made objects containing divine power for their own amusement. It is said that they did so in the Goddess' Ancient Garden but it is difficult to know if this is true. Whatever the case may be, the objects crafted at the time, such as these boots, are still proving their worth.
ITEM_20151022_007358	The fact that the authority of the goddesses is indirectly being used against enemies through the objects they crafted carries great significance even if the goddesses did not put their heart and souls into crafting them.
ITEM_20151022_007359	Long ago, when the goddesses crafted mystical objects for their amusement in the Goddess' Ancient Garden, some were crafted by coating existing ones with their divine power. These clothes are such examples.
ITEM_20151022_007360	It is uncertain if whether the Goddess' Ancient Garden where these gloves were crafted indicates the same location as the Goddess' Ancient Garden known today. Whatever the location may be, the gloves were certainly made in the Goddess' Ancient Garden.
ITEM_20151022_007361	The fact that there are no separate recipes for Ogva equipment is indirect proof that indicates that the origins lie with the goddesses.
ITEM_20151022_007362	Of the many theories, the theory that Laima was the first goddess to propose the crafting of Ogva equipment to the goddesses is the most convincing.
ITEM_20151022_007363	It is unknown if the Goddess' Ancient Garden in which Ogva equipment was said to have been crafted indicates the same location that is known today or how long ago the events took place. However, it is widely believed that it took place before written history.
ITEM_20151022_007364	Some believe that there is an all powerful piece of equipment that contains extreme amounts of divine power based on the fact that Ogva equipment is completed by the goddesses' divine power and spend their lives trying to find it. Of course, all such efforts resulted in failure and it is unknown if there actually is such a piece of equipment. However, those searches did result in the discovery of previously unknown equipment such as these gloves.
ITEM_20151022_007365	We cannot know which powers were given to the various pieces of equipment by certain goddesses long ago in the Goddess' Ancient Garden. However, we can make assumptions. These boots most likely have the divine power of Zemyna.
ITEM_20151022_007366	Some complain that the goddesses should have given this piece of equipment better durability and strength when compared to others.
ITEM_20151022_007367	It is unknown how Ogva equipment were spread and revealed to the world. However, too much time has passed to find those origins.
ITEM_20151022_007368	There have been attempts to control plants with other plants since Medzio Diena. These pieces of equipment are one of the successfully applied cases of those attempts.
ITEM_20151022_007369	It is a difficult task to magically apply the self protection substances of ferns to weapons after Medzio Diena. The goddesses must be thanked for the fact that those efforts succeeded.
ITEM_20151022_007370	There are two methods in crafting magical equipment. One is to follow the recipe from the beginning and the other is to infuse pre-existing equipment. It is the latter in the case of this piece of equipment.
ITEM_20151022_007371	It was relatively easy to apply the magic derived from ferns that saw explosive growth after Medzio Diena to offensive equipment. There are cases where the effects changed or weakened in the case of protective equipment such as in the case of this outfit.
ITEM_20151022_007372	The effort of waiting for the moment a fern blooms in a special place where noone can see is required to craft these gloves. The patience and concentration is rewarded by the gloves enhancing the accuracy of the wearer.
ITEM_20151022_007373	The ritual of watching a fern bloom before Medzio Diena was thought to be a custom for wish fulfillment or good luck, but just like all life has changed afterwards, is now a method of applying magic to protective equipment such as this.
ITEM_20151022_007374	Some are of the belief that the fern observing rituals and the reason that power can be applied to equipment after Medzio Diena is because the goddesses hid mystical powers in ferns long ago. No in depth research has been done by theologians or priests despite the ritual being ancient.
ITEM_20151022_007375	The magic symbol Koru is hidden on this outift in the form of a fern sprout. Sprouts have long been symbols of great religious import.
ITEM_20151022_007376	The individual rings that comprise these gloves have been crafted through the application of magical powers symbolized by fern buds. Magical equipment with this sort of power may not be craftable if the vegetation abnormality disappears one day.
ITEM_20151022_007377	All vegetation that saw explosive growth after Medzio Diena possess some degree of life and energy absorption. To apply this ability to equipment and allow it to absorb energy from the earth is a very difficult task.
ITEM_20151022_007378	Magic extracted from ferns can be made to possess either light seeking or shunning characteristics. However, it is made to resist darkness even if it is theoretically possible to make it resist light due to cost and practicality reasons.
ITEM_20151022_007379	There was a time when Divdirbys master Tesla used to roam the kingdom. Some pieces of magic equipment have tales of his travels. People usually accept such legends even though it is uncertain how the sculptor priest Tesla influenced the crafting of these gloves.
ITEM_20151022_007380	There is a legend of Tesla crafting these boots after being pricked by a thorn in the foot whilst passing Sirdgela Forest. Whether the forest was filled with thorns or if Tesla really crafted the boots after such an experience is not important. Nobody has gone to ask Tesla even though he is alive and well.
ITEM_20151022_007381	Sirdgela equipment is full of legend and story. Some say that these pants were crafted with cloth woven from thread gathered from brambles. There are many people that are fond of the figure of the lonely girl who makes thread from brambles regardless of whether those tales are true or not.
ITEM_20151022_007382	Those that like to seek the stories related to magical items say that these robes were crafted when Tesla decided become a priest as well as an ordinary sculptor. The psychology of people whom like to attach mystical stories to Sirdgela equipment is a field worth researching.
ITEM_20151022_007383	The reason Sirdgela equipment has more diverse and mystical stories than other magical equipment may be influenced by the unique environment of being a Thorn Forest. However, if that is the case, it means that all the stories are from after Medzio Diena making them works of fiction.
ITEM_20151022_007384	According to legend, there were many soldiers going missing in or near Sirdgela, and these boots were crafted by the families and friends looking for their lost ones.
ITEM_20151022_007385	Developments in the use of leather gained from wild animals that have always infested Sirdgela Forest are said to have been the origins behind this outfit.
ITEM_20151022_007386	It is said that many wild animals existed in Sirdgela even before the increase of monsters after Medzio Diena. These gloves are said to have existed since then.
ITEM_20151022_007387	Although this is only one of the many theories that surrounds Sirdgela equipment, it is said that these boots have been traditionally crafted in the Sirdgela region to traverse rough terrain.
ITEM_20151022_007388	It becomes evidence of an item being crafted long ago in a different environment if magical properties that are unrelated to the weather of a location is infused with equipment.
ITEM_20151022_007389	Philis Gloves are said to have had more magic before Medzio Diena. The reasons behind the weakening of magic after the collapse of the 3 layer castle wall on Medzio Diena remains unknown.
ITEM_20151022_007390	Philis equipment is characterized by it's ability to provide it's wearers with pleasantness in closed environments.
ITEM_20151022_007391	This equipment, which used to be the full-dress uniform of the guards of the 3 layer castle wall, had special magical treatment for reasons only known by the leading members of the army. However, it seems that those reasons will be difficult to figure out as all the high ranking officers are dead.
ITEM_20151022_007392	The regulation issued uniforms of the guards of the 3 layer castle wall were produced in various forms according to their needs. These gloves were produced with ordinary siege warfare in mind.
ITEM_20151022_007393	The regulation issued uniforms of the guards of the 3 layer castle wall were produced in various forms according to their needs. These boots were produced with ordinary siege warfare in mind.
ITEM_20151022_007394	Unlike other pieces of Philis equipment, this piece did not exist before Medzio Diena. It was recently infused with magical properties out of necessity.
ITEM_20151022_007395	It was only issued to the outer wall guards during the early years of the kingdom. It was thought to be useful under the assumption that the outer wall was taken. It was later issued to all 3 walls as tactics and weapons of siege warfare changed.
ITEM_20151022_007396	It is the most useful equipment with magical properties not only all castle guards including those on the 3 layers. It has existed as a favorite of many guards for a long time.
ITEM_20151022_007397	This was equipment issued to guards, especially those that were in charge of attacking with fire on the 3 layer castle wall. An interesting theory that is brought up even now is that those guards may have been able to stop the catastrophic growth of vegetation from the capital which is now in ruins.
ITEM_20151022_007398	Although it is a strange phenomenon, the activities of mages and production of magical items is relatively active in the Allerno Barony when compared to other fiefs. This phenomena has increased dramatically after Medzio Diena and these gloves have appeared in such circumstances.
ITEM_20151022_007399	The increase in magical items in the Allerno barony is hard to explain especially when it has always been an agricultural region. Whatever the reason may be, the people fighting in the region can attribute these boots to that phenomenon.
ITEM_20151022_007400	At first glance, it may not seem strange that there are many magical items such as this outfit because there has been an influx of mages to the Allerno barony. However, this is not the truth and the increase in magical items and new inventions are being caused by something else.
ITEM_20151022_007401	Some mages tried to find if whether the new appearances of magical items in the Allerno region is due to demons but failed to do so. Items that resist darkness such as this are proof that the theory is unlikely.
ITEM_20151022_007402	Whatever the reason behind the sudden appearance of items may be, they are actively gathering and issuing such items to men in Allerno barony. This may be the reason behind mounting conflicts between the residents and soldiers in the region.
ITEM_20151022_007403	It is certain that the Allerno region is being magically influenced from the outside. Although it may not be an impressive amount, the fact still stands that these boots regardless of their performance show new methods of magic infusion.
ITEM_20151022_007404	Another strange point about the magical items that have appeared in the Allerno region is that the mages that come here do not seek them. The items that are discovered are being used by residents or soldiers.
ITEM_20151022_007405	The current lord of Allerno has hired mages and craftsmen in order to further enhance the equipment that already has strong defensive powers. It is said that such moves are hiding other reasons.
ITEM_20151022_007406	If the lord of Allerno did not simply hire the mages and craftsmen to enhance the magical equipment, there is a chance that his goal may be connected to why such items are suddenly appearing.
ITEM_20151022_007407	The lord of Allerno wishes that rarer and stronger magical items will be discovered in his lands. While greed is also behind such thinking, it is also difficult to reproduce the items that have been discovered.
ITEM_20151022_007408	The lord of Allerno is trying to wear this equipment after enhancing it. It is said that he hired mages and craftsmen for this very reason.
ITEM_20151022_007409	There are cases of divine power residing in items that had been carried by priests for a long time. Perelin gloves were crafted as a successful result of trying to have these happenings occur reliably when needed.
ITEM_20151022_007410	There are cases in which the divine power of goddesses indwells and shows new powers in trivial items that poor pilgrims were carrying on their pilgrimage. Equipment with the name Perelin are such items.
ITEM_20151022_007411	It cannot be known what type of protection is indwelling in which pilgrim's items. However, there is some regularity even though generalities have not been discovered. Otherwise, these items would not be able to have the name Perelin.
ITEM_20151022_007412	Many different kinds of experiments are enacted in order to craft Perelin items. The most widely known experiment was to have the pilgrims wear the equipment until divine power resides in it. The results indicate that this does not increase the chance of divine power indwelling in the equipment.
ITEM_20151022_007413	There are increased chances of items becoming Perelin items in the case of making pilgrims perform various tasks whilst wearing the equipment such as these gloves. However, it cannot be seen as a precise recipe as the exact moment that they receive divine power is unknown.
ITEM_20151022_007414	The effects of Perelin items do not disappear even if given to other people after realizing that they have become Perelin items during the pilgrimage. There is no firm principle behind the creation of Perelin items even though pilgrims that have had a piece of equipment turn into Perelin items before usually are able to have more.
ITEM_20151022_007415	Inquiries of whether pilgrims living pious lives makes the authority of goddesses reside in items and whether the creation of items with even more profound abilities is possible is still ongoing. It is only natural if taking the tough living conditions after Medzio Diena.
ITEM_20151022_007416	It is unknown why such phenomena occurs to pilgrims instead of pious priests that stay in one place. It is made even more unclear by the fact that there are certain cases proving otherwise. The most simple answer is that everything is done in the will of the goddesses.
ITEM_20151022_007417	Although it may seem obvious, these Perelin gloves appear frequently on Paladins.
ITEM_20151022_007418	Perelin items do not always appear on priests. There are numerous cases in which Perelin gloves have appeared on warrior type believers.
ITEM_20151022_007419	The principle behind the natural appearance of Perelin items may never be realized. However, people keep trying to find it thanks to the divine protection that they provide.
ITEM_20151022_007420	According to legend, the first person to obtain Perelin equipment was the first Paladin master. However, it is unclear if this is the truth as the Tenet Church refuses to verify such trivial stories.
ITEM_20151022_007421	Many mages have crafted numerous magical items in the mage tower since Agailla Flurry's death. Most of the creators are anonymous despite several of the items still being used to this day. These are designated as Turn equipment.
ITEM_20151022_007422	Turn equipment have nothing more in common than the fact that they have their origins in the Mage tower. They are simply named as such due to the need to indicate equipment from the tower after Flurry.
ITEM_20151022_007423	Some Turn equipment is suspected to have been made by the same mage due to the similarities in their effects. As in the Turn pants and the Turn robe. But the possibility that they may have been crafted by different mages of different times can't be ruled out.
ITEM_20151022_007424	There was a time when the mages of the Mage Tower after Flurry's death isolated themselves from the world and focused on their experiments and research. Although there were many whimsical inventions during that time, the only partially practical inventions that remain are these Turn gloves.
ITEM_20151022_007425	According to some, Turn equipment may have had better power in the beginning. However, there are no remaining items or recipes due to the reclusive nature of mages. Most of the equipment left has about the same amount of magic as these boots.
ITEM_20151022_007426	There are several cases where they were created out of necessity of mages. It is said that Turn leather pants were created on the spot to protect mages when conducting experiments with lightning.
ITEM_20151022_007427	There are several cases where they were created out of necessity of mages. It is said that Turn leather tunics were created on the spot to protect mages when conducting experiments with lightning.
ITEM_20151022_007428	Some Turn equipment has been reinforced or applied in various ways while being used outside of the Mage Tower. The first known case of such enhancements are these gloves.
ITEM_20151022_007429	There was a time where metallic equipment was not crafted because of the many experiments conducted by mages after Flurry's death. Therefore, the existing metallic Turn equipment may have originated from mages but have been completed by anonymous contributors outside of the Mage Tower.
ITEM_20151022_007430	Unlike other metallic Turn equipment, Turn plate leggings are being crafted by mages. It is said that they were used when mages were attempting to fly.
ITEM_20151022_007431	Metallic equipment was not made for centuries after Flurry's death because there was a shortage of metals thanks to the many experiments conducted by mages. As such, even though the existing metallic Turn equipment may have originated from mages, the actual craftsmen are anonymous people from outside the Mage Tower.
ITEM_20151022_007432	The Druid Master from Shaton and tried to make the region safer after Medzio Diena by providing or helping the crafting of equipment. There are cases in which non-combatant farmers have received help from these gloves.
ITEM_20151022_007433	The Druid Master is sending several of her disciples to Shaton to perform various tasks not only out of the love of her hometown but also becuase it is related to her Nature Restoration Plan. The local residents are imitating a few of the simple magic equipment that are used to keep the disciples safe.
ITEM_20151022_007434	The Druid Master does not put restrictions on the Shaton locals imitating the magical equipment that she provided. Therefore, some are being used by people from neighboring regions or explorers, such as these pants.
ITEM_20151022_007435	People being harassed by monsters after Medzio Diena require easily obtainable magical equipment. However, such support is not easy to receive due to several complications. The situation is bad enough that sometimes soldiers fighting monsters on the front lines are not able to obtain equipment they need. The fact that the Druid Master is using her power and resources for the Shaton region is a small but noble act.
ITEM_20151022_007436	Shaton equipment provides diverse amenities for the livelihood of the locals even if they do not fight monsters. Even farmers and lumberjacks need to be accurate.
ITEM_20151022_007437	Some settlers from the Shaton region have disappeared with the equipment. It is unclear if they made a run for it after obtaining equipment or have fallen victim to monsters. Both are equally as likely to have happened. The fact that many of those that have disappeared are people that have obtained boots suggests a certain possibility.
ITEM_20151022_007438	The percentage of settlers in the Shaton region being burned while working has decreased dramatically after this outfit has been issued.
ITEM_20151022_007439	The Druid Master also freely gave help to the nobles of the Shaton region. As a result, the nobility of Shaton was able to increase their survivability when combating monsters.
ITEM_20151022_007440	Some express their concerns that the way the Druid Master unconditionally gave magical items to the Shaton nobility might have been a bad idea. They argue that metallic equipment such as these leggings need not have been provided. In the end however, what is more important is whether the people using the equipment do so with good or bad intentions.
ITEM_20151022_007441	There are some of the belief that it is more important that people are protected from monsters even if they are abusing the Druid Master's goodwill. Such people praise the Druid Master for providing metallic armor.
ITEM_20151022_007442	Many people have found various means to donate to the Tyla Monastery which is a historic religious facility. Those donations became the foundations to the emergence to magical equipment unique to the Tyla Monastery.
ITEM_20151022_007443	Some of the Tyla Monastery equipment was improved with the consent of the original donor. Many people could receive the benefits of such equipment because the Tyla Monastery does not monopolize these items.
ITEM_20151022_007444	The equipment made by the wealth and magical equipment donated to the Tyla Monastery helped people greatly when the surrounding region became a thorn forest. Of course the people that benefited the most were the monks of the Monastery.
ITEM_20151022_007445	The reason why the Tyla Monastery receives particularly more contributions and donations is because it has historically been more lenient towards rulebreakers. The Tyla Monastery has treated sinners and lawbreakers alike gently focusing on reformation instead of punishment in accordance to the Monastery's traditions.
ITEM_20151022_007446	Tyla Monastery has been able to play it's role as a strict self-sufficient religious belief community for priests for a long time without losing sight of the original ideals thanks to it's principles of being strict towards monks and tolerant of outsiders. As such, some magical equipment here has been used in everyday life instead of combat as can be similarly observed in other regions. This is the representative example of such equipment.
ITEM_20151022_007447	Meeting goddesses before Medzio Diena was not uncommon. Even so, criminals who were shameful of their past deeds wished the Tyla Monastery would be a window between themselves and the goddesses and the many that were reformed donated to the Monastery providing the foundations of current Tyla Monastery equipment.
ITEM_20151022_007448	Even equipment that may have been thought to be useless due to the climate of Tyla Monastery became useful after Medzio Diena. This piece of equipment is such a case.
ITEM_20151022_007449	Even the royal family is on the donator list of Tyla Monastery. Many people can wear good metallic equipment thanks to the fact that the Monastery does not hesitate even in distributing royal gifts if useful to the people.
ITEM_20151022_007450	Tyla Monastery was generous in the distribution of all magical equipment they deem can be useful to the people since the royal family did not attach any strings when gifting equipment to the monastery. That is how many people have benefited from these boots.
ITEM_20151022_007451	This piece of equipment has become much more important after the expansive growth of the Thorn Forest near the Tyla Monastery after Medzio Diena.
ITEM_20151022_007452	It is said that this equipment used to have different magical properties. They say that different magical properties were infused after Medzio Diena because of the expansive growth of the Thorn Forest.

ITEM_20160310_010221	Regardless of what rights the goddess of the earth may give, those who carry and use this equipment do so to their own abilities. Do you not wonder whether it possesses an even greater power?
