QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000001	Kedoran Alliance Merchant Alta
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000002	I came here since I was worried, but I won't dare to go in there by myself.{nl}That's why I am asking you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000003	I can't just wonder into places like that you know.{nl}There are monsters just sitting there...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000004	There's rumors of the Alembique Legend among the refugees.{nl}I wanted to know the truth.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000005	{nl}There might be products that the Alliance is looking for...{nl}Since you were going to explore the cave anyways, it's like hitting two Popolions with one stone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000006	{nl}I'll give you this book as payment.{nl}It'll be better than going in blind will it not?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000007	Priest Lintas is correcting the contents of the monument.{nl}The process is taking some time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000008	Thanks to you, the monument has been corrected.{nl}We need to check up on the status of Priest Kidas and Brunas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000009	Even with the help, a flechette is nowhere to be found.{nl}I should go back to my master after sorting things out a bit in here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000010	Aquilas
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000011	I came here to learn archery but am just running errands finding that blasted arrow...{nl}If I knew that I had to look for arrows. I would not have started this journey...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000012	I mean, this is all because of Lydia Schaffen.{nl}She should have taken her Flechette or whatever if she had used it to kill Ghibulinas!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000013	{nl}Who cares if she is a legendary person.{nl}She doesn't know how to look after her things.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000014	{nl}I can't understand my master.{nl}I don't know how I can be forgiven if I find that Flechette or whatever.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000015	{nl}Even if I do somehow agree that it is important... I don't get how reporting on the vegetation is supposed to be important.{nl}Ugh... Not my kind of work.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000016	I'd be really grateful if you'd offer any type of help.{nl}First of all, could you get me some Poppy Bracken, Aily Grass and Pria Flowers.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000017	{nl}What do they have to do with the legendary arrow?{nl}I have no idea either.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000018	Stupid Flechette or whatever it's called...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000019	Mechen
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000020	I thought that Aquilas had come to report...{nl}This place is dangerous due to all of the monsters and demons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000021	{nl}How about leaving if you don't have any important business.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000022	{nl}Oh?{nl}Ah, you're a Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000023	{nl}It seems as if you are curious as to what my apprentices and I are doing here.{nl}Have you heard anything from Aquilas?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000024	{nl}Oh, I am a member of the Astral Tower and sibling to the former leader.{nl}I made a big mistake while Ignas was trying to take control of the Astral Tower.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000025	{nl}Ignas didn't miss out on the opportunity and took over the Astral Tower.{nl}Of course, the rest of the members don't look upon me so kindly.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000026	{nl}No matter how I tell them that it was a mistake, they refuse to listen.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000027	{nl}That's why I have decided to try and find Lydia Schaffen's Flechette to try and undo my wrongdoings.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000028	{nl}They'll at least pretend to listen if I bring back the Flechette.{nl}I've come to this place as I am almost certain that her Flechette must be in Ghibulinas Forest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000029	{nl}My apprentices and I have been trying to look for the Flechette but there's been no progress.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000030	I see you've gathered it all.{nl}Thanks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000031	{nl}Go to the camp and ask my master if you're wondering why we had to do this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000032	{nl}Well, I'd better start looking at these unremarkable things to find something different.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000033	Hmm... I thank you for your eagerness, but this place is much too dangerous with all of the demons roaming around. {nl}I would appreciate it if you would simply ask my apprentices how they are doing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000034	{nl}Woognis is at the Vilkas Nest, Jenonhas is at Kainen Crossing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000035	Whoa, you scared me! Who are you?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000036	{nl}The current situation?{nl}I haven't even gone anywhere near the area since I'm too afraid.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000037	{nl}That over there is the Vilkas nest, but how am I supposed to get in there.{nl}I don't know, maybe I'll be able to get there if I cover myself with Vilkas fur...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000038	We'll be put in danger if we go and fight Vilkas near their nest.{nl}There are a lot of Vilkas at Kyrba Lot as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000039	{nl}Why don't we try gathering Vilkas fur over there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000040	There's a lot of Vilkas at Kyrba Lot, so it should be easy enough to get their fur there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000041	I think we'll be able to fool them into thinking we're one of their friends with this amount of fur.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000042	I'm thinking of going to search their nest with this fur all over me.{nl}It's quite large so I don't know how long it will take but...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000043	There's no reason for me to decline your offer of help.{nl}Let's go.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000044	There doesn't seem to be a Flechette where I checked.{nl}Did you find anything?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000045	{nl}Ah yes...{nl}Nothing...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000046	So my search has resulted in nothing.{nl}You said that you were gathering reports?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000047	{nl}There are two other apprentices.{nl}One is Aquilas and the other is Jenonhas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000048	{nl}Aquilas is on the road to Phamer Forest and Jenonhas is at Kainen Crossing.{nl}You said that you've already met Aquilas, so try looking for Jenonhas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000049	I'll return after wrapping things up here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000050	Jenonhas
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000051	Thank you so much.{nl}I wouldn't have made it if you hadn't come here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000052	Yes, that is correct.{nl}I am looking for the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000053	{nl}If it was something that could have been found so easily, people would have already taken it, don't you think?{nl}This is pointless.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000054	{nl}There are even demons here.{nl}I can't understand my orders this time round.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000055	{nl}I'm going to have to talk about this later.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000056	Everyone is exhausted since they're searching for an arrow that seems to be non-existant.{nl}Especially where there are so many demons roaming around...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000057	{nl}It's all because I am not skilled enough.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000058	The first Fletcher Master crafted the Flechette for Lydia Schaffen.{nl}Of course I thought about asking the Fletcher Master.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000059	{nl}But the Fletcher Master and the other members of the Astral Tower... They won't talk to me because they think I am a traitor.{nl}That's why I am not even thinking about it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000060	Of course I would appreciate the help but...{nl}I'm sure that it won't make a difference.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000061	{nl}Don't be too disappointed though.{nl}The Fletcher Master is at the Goddess' Ancient Garden.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000062	Fletcher Master
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000063	You said that Mechen asked you to find the Flechette?{nl}You still came to me knowing what kind of person he is correct?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000064	{nl}Of course I might think of helping him if he agrees to return the Flechette after finding it.{nl}However, he'll show his true colors as soon as we find the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000065	If you say that, I'll agree to help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000066	{nl}This is a recipe for detecting the Flechette.{nl}Take this to Mechen.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000067	The Goddess' Ancient Garden...{nl}It will be a long trip.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000068	He gave you a recipe that will allow us to craft equipment that will help us detect the Flechette?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000069	{nl}How did he decide to help us?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000070	{nl}Ah... 
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000071	{nl}I see.{nl}He agreed to help us under the condition of having my life if I do not give the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000072	{nl}I don't think that will be necessary.{nl}I'll take a look at this recipe then...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000073	Mechen is the person who allowed the previous leader for the Astral Tower, his brother, to be taken down.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000074	{nl}How can I trust such a person.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000075	The Flechette is said to be crafted from the divine energy of the Goddess.{nl}It says that we have to get the energy of a powerful demon since it will react to their energy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000076	I'm worried that he might make us go and find capture a demon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000077	You've collected a lot.{nl}Now what we need is...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000078	The recipe says that we need Vilkas essence in order to control the demon's energy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000079	My apprentices have gone to different locations to gather Vilkas essence.{nl}Could you please go to Kyrba Lot?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000080	All you have to do is gather Vilkas essence from Kyrba Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000081	We have gathered all of the materials needed to create the detector.{nl}I'll start crafting it then.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000082	I've finished crafting the detector.{nl}I'm going to give it to my apprentices to try and find the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000083	{nl}I guess it will make it easier to find the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000084	If you wish to participate in finding the Flechette, please start at Taylie Lot.{nl}The other places will be covered by my apprentices.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000085	{nl}Try using the detector at Taylie Lot at places you think the Flechette might be.{nl}It will react if the Flechette is nearby.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000086	Go to Taylie Lot and look for the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000087	Ah, have you found the Flechette?{nl}It feels a bit abrupt after all that fruitless time we spent searching for it...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000088	{nl}Of course, none of us are Revelators...{nl}Good job.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000089	{nl}Now it's time to take the Flechette to the Fletcher Master.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000090	Please be careful.{nl}I wish that this would help resolve the misunderstanding between us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000091	This... it is the Flechette that was created by my elders.{nl}I didn't think that Mechen would give it this easily.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000092	{nl}Hmm...{nl}Take this.{nl}Tell him that this is a sort of reward for finding me the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000093	{nl}I don't know how much good it will do for his honor...{nl}But people will at least know how much he went through to find the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000094	A promise is a promise, so I'll hand it over.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000095	This... it's an Arrow of Proof crafted by the Fletcher Master...{nl}I hope people will listen to me a bit more if I have this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000096	This will help Mechen recover some of his honor.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000097	Hello there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000098	{nl}We are apprentices of Maven.{nl}We are rewriting the misinformation that has been spread about the Ruklys incident on this Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000099	{nl}These were almost destroyed because of the actions for King Kadumel.{nl}However, King Barynwell decided to cast magic on them to make them unreadable instead.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000100	{nl}We are preparing to undo the magic and make the corrections.{nl}The monsters are stopping us from doing anything though.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000101	We will gladly accept any help you can offer us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000102	{nl}First of all, we need to find the documents.{nl}These documents contain instructions on how to dispell transfiguration magic, but they've been scattered due to monster attacks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000103	{nl}We were careful in making any further moves since we don't want to provoke any more monster attacks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000104	{nl}Please try looking at Othorove Lot first.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000105	We need those documents to dispell the magic and correct the information on this Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000106	I see that they've all been scattered like this.{nl}Thank you for gathering all of the pages.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000107	{nl}Now...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000108	We'll have to find an orb in order to dispell the magic.{nl}The orb will quickly be depleted so we also had a recharging orb.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000109	The orb will absorb the energy from the recharging orb.{nl}Therefore, you should be able to find where the orb is if you carry this around with you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000110	The recharging orb will emmit magic when activated.{nl}The magic will go towards the orb since it will try to absorb it and will glow when it does so.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000111	{nl}All you have to do is to find the orb.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000112	Magic will come out of the recharging orb when it is activated.{nl}You'll be able to find the orb if you follow it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000113	Oh, thank you so much!{nl}Now that we have the orbs...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000114	We have finished all of the preparations required to dispel the magic on King Kadumel's Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000115	You've dealt with the Gosal?{nl}I can't believe that you took that thing on single handed when the three of us...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000116	{nl}You don't seem to be just another traveler for some reason...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000117	Whatever the case may be, the Gosal is gone, so we'll be able to go there.{nl}We'll have to check Tarkha Lot to see what the object is.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000118	This thing that looks like a tree is actually an monument.{nl}This is all because of the spell.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000119	{nl}We'll dispell it with the orb you've recovered for us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000120	The monument has now returned to it's original shape.{nl}We'll now find any pieces of misinformation and correct them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000121	We've finished correcting this one, so we'll have to search for other monuments.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000122	{nl}Please, follow me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000123	Here it is.{nl}I will dispell the magic that is cast on the monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000124	I think that the spores from this bracken have caused the paralysis.{nl}I can't dispell the magic in this state.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000125	{nl}We'll have to wait for me to be able to move again.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000126	{nl}You can find Mittelly Herbs near Ausne Lot.{nl}Mittelly Herbs are known to cure such issues.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000127	There should be plenty of Mittelly Herbs near Ausne Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000128	{nl}I'm sorry for being so dependant when you simply volunteered to help...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000129	There are people that have started to deny the existance of the Goddesses after they have all disappeared.{nl}I want to help them believe once more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000130	{nl}However...{nl}I lost my faith in people... as well as the Seed...{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000131	At this rate...{nl}I am afraid that I might lose all faith in humanity...{nl}Not a good thing for a priest...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000132	Ah, that feels much better.{nl}I don't think it has completely healed me, but it is enough to allow me to dispell the magic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000133	All Vaivora's Koru is able to tell us is that Goddess Ausrine is in a mysterious place.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000134	What do you think that the mysterious place will look like?{nl}We have more questions than answers...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000135	Goddess Lada is said to be at Seir Rainforest.{nl}The closest place is most likely Arcus Forest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000136	I suppose I'll be able to meet her if I go to Seir Rainforest?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000137	Will you be so kind as to remove the bracken from the Monument?{nl}I'll be paralyzed once more if you don't do so.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000138	{nl}I doubt it will burn because of all the humidity in this area.{nl}Maybe using the dry skin of the Vilkas would be enough to light a proper fire.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000139	If the plague rears it's ugly head once more the people of Kiren Province won't stand a chance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000140	I never even imagined that there would be bracken with paralyzing spores.{nl}Thank you so much for helping me out.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000141	{nl}However... I can't imagine that you are just a simple traveler.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000142	I see that all the bracken has burned.{nl}I'll dispell the magic on the Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000143	Hmm... I've checked the Monument, but it seems as if this one doesn't need to be corrected.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000144	Ah, you have gathered quite a lot.{nl}I'm sure that they'll burn nicely even in this humidity.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000145	The paralysis doesn't seem to be getting any better.{nl}What should I do...?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000146	Thank you so much.{nl}I'll give you the detector that had allowed me to find the Monuments.{nl}All you need to do is to use it near an object you think might be a Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000147	Use the detector near anything you think might be a Monument.{nl}The detector will let you know it's a Monument by creating a circle around it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000148	You've found a Monument.{nl}I think I am well enough to move now, so let's head over there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000149	I've dispelled the magic and checked what is written on the Monument.{nl}However, it is hard to see what is on it since it has been badly damaged.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000150	There might be fragments nearby.{nl}Could you please check the surrounding area?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000151	There should be fragments from the Monument nearby.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000152	Ah, I see that you've collected quite a few fragments.{nl}Let me check those.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000153	I've checked all of the fragments you brought back.{nl}There's a few that have misinformation on them, so please give me a second to correct them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000154	Priest Kidas
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000155	Have you come all this way to help?{nl}May you be blessed by the Goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000156	{nl}Checking the contents of this Monument will be difficult.{nl}As you can see, there are too many vines surrounding it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000157	{nl}Brunas and myself were trying to get rid of the vegetation here, but we couldn't find any useful materials.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000158	{nl}We'd like to use Vilkas salivary glands since they have strong abrasive properties, but getting them is a problem since they won't just give them to us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000159	Getting them to give us the salivary glands is quite hard...{nl}We'll have to wait for them to become weak after attacking them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000160	{nl}You will have to feed them Mytiharyn Grass when they're weakened. This will make them salivate abrasive saliva.{nl}You will have to finish them off now and get the salivary glands.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000161	Of course, they might attack you and resist eating the Mytiharyn Grass, so please be careful.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000162	The salivary glands you brought should be enough.{nl}However...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000163	We need water to dilute the poison from the salivary glands you brought.{nl}Brunas went to Putas Lot to get the water, but hasn't come back for a while...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000164	I hope everything is okay...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000165	Priest Brunas
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000166	Thank you. You saved my life.{nl}Ah, you've collected all of the salivary glands needed?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000167	{nl}We'll be able to get rid of the vegetation once I take this water there then.{nl}I'll hurry back to Kidas then.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000168	I've heard that you helped Kidas and Brunas a lot.{nl}Thank you for allowing us to finish our work. It had been stalled for a long time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000169	{nl}I knew I was right in thinking you're not just a normal traveler.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000170	{nl}Whomever you may really be, may you be blessed by the Goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000171	We are planning on publishing a book with the corrections made to these Monuments in order to allow more people to know about the truth.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000172	{nl}Please make sure to take a look at the book if you have a chance to do so.{nl}Thank you for all the helped you gave us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000173	This is an area where a plague that caused fevers in people before leading them to their death.{nl}It's a bit quiet at the moment, but we don't know when it'll become worse again.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000174	{nl}I'm in the middle of researching that plague.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000175	I might die before I get anywhere near completing a cure if you don't help me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000176	I am going to send the cure to the Plague Doctor Master when it is complete.{nl}I will try strengthening it just in case.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000177	Go and see how Woognis is doing at the Vilkas Nest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000178	Something must have happened to Priest Lintas who was dispelling the magic from the monument. Approach him to see what is wrong.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000179	Kidas has removed the vegetation from the Monument and is taking a closer look.{nl}It seems to be taking much longer than expected.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000180	You've come back.{nl}I heard that you saved Brunas from monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000181	{nl}I thank you for helping us gather all of the ingredients and saving Brunas.{nl}We finished diluting the poison while you were coming back.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000182	{nl}We'll correct any misinformation on the Monument after removing the vegetation.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000183	There was misinformation on the Monument, so we corrected it.{nl}We're going to go back and report to Lintas about our success here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000184	{nl}Thank you for helping us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000185	I am grateful to all of my apprentices who followed me all the way here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000186	I feel sorry that I haven't been able to teach them properly because of my mistakes and poor decisions.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000187	I followed him to learn archery, not about shrubs.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000188	Here I am ripping weeds out instead of at the archery range.{nl}I am seriously considering just going back home.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000189	I told him that I don't want to pick at weeds anymore and he told me to wait here.{nl}I hope he won't tell me to go and gather leaves next.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000190	I feel like I'll forget how to lose how to hold a bow.{nl}I should go and ask him to teach me archery instead of how to get rid of weeds.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000191	I always picked on Jenonhas because of his direct way of communication.{nl}It seems like that we won't have to pick any more weeds thanks to him though.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000192	They say that a person called Ignas became the leader of the Astral Tower because of a mistake he made.{nl}What sort of mistake gets the leader of the Astral Tower changed?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000193	We followed him because we wished to learn archery.{nl}However, all he is doing is trying to find the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000194	It is pretty much impossible to find an arrow in this large area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000195	Jenonhas and Aquilas have a lot of resentment at the moment.{nl}Of course, Aquilas would rather keep his complaints under wraps.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000196	Jenonhas on the other hand, is much more direct and forthcoming.{nl}I'm actually sort of amazed that he didn't say anything up to this point.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000197	Jenonhas and Aquilas are as tired out as I am with this fruitless search.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000198	There was a time when I asked him about what mistake he made to buy the wrath of the Astral Tower members.{nl}He didn't answer me at the time and looked into the distance while sighing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000199	It is said that Lydia Schaffen had defeated the Demon King Ghibulinas in this forest with the Flechette.{nl}However, Lydia Schaffen hadn't retrieved that fantastic arrow after that feat.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000200	{nl}Why didn't Lydia Schaffen retrieve her arrow?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000201	I tried my best to find the Flechette thinking that it would help him recover his honor.{nl}However, I was threatened by monsters and demons the whole time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000202	{nl}I thought that I might lose my life while trying to regain his honor.{nl}That's why I went to talk about the current situation.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000203	{nl}I don't care if this will reflect poorly on me.{nl}It is better than watching my colleagues die trying to find an arrow.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000204	I don't understand the Astral Tower's reaction to him either.{nl}Of course, I don't know what his mistake was but...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000205	{nl}They are said to have gone through a lot together...{nl}I think that the members of the Astral Tower should forgive him now...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000206	How sad do you think a Master would be if one of his apprentices lost their honor.{nl}Maven must have been extremely sad watching on as Ruklys lost his honor.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000207	I am going to continue Maven's work by letting the people know the truth about Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000208	I will correct the misunderstandings that have been plaguing the Kingdom since King Kadumel's time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000209	This must be done no matter how hard it is to make people take another look at Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000210	Rewriting the history regarding Ruklys is needed in order to correct the misinformation that is included in our history.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000211	Kidas and myself would have done our part once we check and correct this Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000212	We will correct the misinformation about Ruklys by correcting this Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000213	Ohla
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000214	Hello there!{nl}Have you seen my daughter by any chance?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000215	{nl}She has twin-tails and is wearing a hood.{nl}Her name's Liel.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000216	{nl}She disappeared without saying anything...{nl}I thought she had gone to a friend's house and checked there but there was no trace of her there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000217	{nl}I think she may have gone out of the Refugee Camp.{nl}I've tried asking people to help, but nobody seem to be willing to help me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000218	{nl}I know that it's asking a lot with the monsters threatening everyone but...{nl}I've come out since I was so worried but there doesn't seem to be anything I can do.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000219	If there was anywhere I thought she might be, I would have gone there already...{nl}I guess we should try looking for places nearby.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000220	{nl}Could you please try looking at Preivhengikas Felled Area?{nl}Where could she have gone with all of these monsters crawling around...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000221	She's my only daughter and family since I lost my husband during Medzio Diena.{nl}She's all I have in this world now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000222	{nl}Please, find Liel for me...{nl}Please...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000223	I don't know what my mother is thinking...{nl}Not even knowing that I left to get her some wool so she won't catch any more colds...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000224	{nl}The fact that I couldn't do anything for her and that she had to go to...{nl}I am so sorry...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000225	Thank the Goddess...{nl}I already don't know how to repay you for saving my daughter...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000226	{nl}But you're offering to even get the wool...{nl}I don't know how I am to repay you for your generousity...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000227	There's an insect called the White Tree Forest Moth...{nl}It's cacoons are known to be around here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000228	{nl}Liel used to go and gather them to use as silk.{nl}I don't know where she hears these things...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000229	{nl}I know she's my daughter, but isn't she resourceful?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000230	I'm just sorry that I can't offer her more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000231	We're searching this area for a Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000232	I think that this should be enough to stitch the tent back up.{nl}Thank you so much for helping me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000233	Curtis
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000234	Ah, you must be the person who saved that girl, Liel.{nl}The way you simply dealed with the monsters that several young men weren't able to tackle...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000235	{nl}Ah, look at me... I've forgetten to introduce myself.{nl}My name's Curtis.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000236	{nl}I'm just another refugee who lost his family and home during Medzio Diena and is trying to get by.{nl}I don't think that coming here helped matters at all.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000237	{nl}It's difficult getting things that are needed for basic survival.{nl}That means there are more conflicts between the refugees as well as theives...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000238	{nl}We've tried to make some rules and set up defences against the monsters that keep attacking us but...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000239	We were in dire need of help.{nl}If you're capable of saving Liel, I'm sure you're more than able to help us a bit more!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000240	{nl}I know we might seem a tad ungrateful, but please...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000241	{nl}There are many who haven't had a proper meal for a long time.{nl}We've lost the farmland that we took so much care of...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000242	{nl}We need something to settle that hunger more than anything.{nl}Could you please get us some Flowlevi head flower?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000243	{nl}When dried the seeds come out.{nl}We can cook them
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000244	The monsters in this area are a bit more fierce since they are all starving.{nl}Please don't try to bite off more than you can chew and just run if you think it's a bit too much.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000245	Many people will have full stomaches today thanks to the food you've brought back.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000246	Monsters have been attacking us much more frequently.{nl}That's why we've put up those walls and distributed any weapons we could find to the young men.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000247	{nl}The walls keep the monsters at bay, but we're worried that they aren't strong enough.{nl}They seem to break whenever monsters decide to start rampaging.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000248	{nl}We're repairing them with wood each time.{nl}What I'm saying is that we use a lot of wood just repairing the walls.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000249	Go to Saughus Lot with the tools I gave you.{nl}You'll be able to get a lot of good materials there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000250	{nl}After gathering some wood there, you'll be able to make some repair kits for the walls.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000251	The problem was that the walls were weak since nobody had any knowledge on how to make them.{nl}They break down every time monsters decide to attack us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000252	{nl}That's why we have to keep repairing them every day.{nl}Of course that means we need a lot of wood as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000253	This should be enough for one repair session.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000254	I'll distribute the wood you've gathered to allow the repairs to start.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000255	I know we've asked a lot, but please...{nl}All you need to do is to repair the wall in front of you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000256	The rest will be repaired by the other people.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000257	We could have scraped by and repaired the walls but...{nl}I had no idea that you would help us so generously.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000258	Michekan Forest is extremely cold at night.{nl}You'll catch frostbites if you don't wrap up tightly enough at night.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000259	{nl}That's why we need a lot of clothes or covers that use Flowlon leathers.{nl}Of course it isn't easy for us to deal with the monsters in the first place...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000260	This place is cold enough at night to make you shiver non-stop.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000261	I think this will be enough for all the people here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000262	The worst part of this place is the lack of water.{nl}We did manage to set up a few wells here and there...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000263	{nl}We haven't been able to drink it after the poison from the White Trees managed to trickle into the water supply.{nl}We've had to purify the water in one way or another.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000264	{nl}We are using a grass called Randulin.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000265	I'll give you a bottle of water.{nl}The problem is that Randulin usually is well hidden beneath the earth.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000266	{nl}However, it will turn yellow when touched by the un-purified water here.{nl}You'll be able to see where the Randulin is by sprinkling the ground with this water.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000267	A lot of people suffered greatly when we didn't know about the issues with the water.{nl}Aurlelse who is good with herbs, taught people how to purify the water.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000268	Yes.{nl}What you have brought is indeed Randulin.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000269	{nl}I think that will allow us to drink purified water for quite some time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000270	Did I tell you about the farmland that we had worked on?{nl}We had used the cable-car here in order to create arable land over at Lacetti Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000271	{nl}Even if it's a bit far from here, there's a lot of sunlight as well as soft soil.{nl}But we always had to be prepared to fix the old and worn cable-car since it was the only way for use to get there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000272	{nl}That's why we prepared tools to fix it at a moments notice in a pouch and place it somewhere we could find easily.{nl}The monsters mistook them for food bags and stole them all.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000273	Monsters must have been starving too.{nl}Taking something they cannot eat...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000274	Ah, yes.{nl}Those are the pouches.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000275	There's still a problem left even if we are able to repair the cable-car again.{nl}As soon as we tilled the soil at Phavegheliai, monsters started attacking us there as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000276	{nl}This is a matter of our survival.{nl}People will start starving if monsters are allowed to control that land for too long.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000277	{nl}That's why I'm gathering young men to go and drive them off.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000278	I knew that it wouldn't be something that a handful of people could accomplish...{nl}I believe that you'll manage to tip things in our favor even more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000279	Phavegheliai Farm will be on the other end of the cable-car that you get on at Lacetti Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000280	Liel...Are you there Liel?{nl}Where could she have gone to...{nl}I told her to not go out of the Refugee Camp...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000281	If you see a girl with a hood that has twin-tails, please bring her here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000282	I'm looking for a girl with a hood and twin-tails.{nl}Her name is Liel. Have you seen her?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000283	If you do find her, please bring her back to me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000284	Phavegheliai Farm was nothing but grasslands.{nl}It seemed perfect since there wasn't too many monsters and the sunlight was good here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000285	{nl}That's why we started to farm here and the crops made it well.{nl}Then, the monsters came after the crops and we lost control of the farm.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000286	It seems like we'll be able to farm again thanks to you.{nl}I suppose it would be too much to ask you to stay with us?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000287	{nl}Why don't you meet the people before you leave...{nl}I'm sure they'll have plenty to say to you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000288	You've listened to all of the worries of the people here?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000289	{nl}I'm sure there wasn't one story that wasn't heartbreaking.{nl}Some feel like life here is nothing but trouble.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000290	{nl}Some people say that I don't know about the severity of this situation, but I assure you that I do.{nl}This type of life will not be sustainable without material help from someone else.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000291	{nl}I am sorry for the children as they will not be able to see the outside world.{nl}I have of course considered moving somehwere else.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000292	{nl}However, we don't know exactly where we are in the Great Woodlands so we can't simply pick a direction either.{nl}We don't have enough food or supplies and the monsters are a never ending threat.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000293	Really?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000294	{nl}Thank you.{nl}We would appreciate it if you could go to a major city for help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000295	I see that there are refugees that haven't been able to receive proper assistance.{nl}I shall ask the lords near Michekan if they can't offer some help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000296	How did it go?{nl}Is there a city willing to help us?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000297	The Knight Commander at Klaipeda said that he'd request help from the other lords?{nl}That's just what I wanted to hear.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000298	{nl}Thank you so much for going the extra bit for us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000299	I shall ask the lords near Michekan Forest to aid the refugees.{nl}I'll try to make them hurry a bit as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000300	Aurlelse
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000301	I think of the peaceful days before Medzio Diena every day.{nl}The Potato Dumplings I used to have with my wife were the best...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000302	I lost my wife to a large branch that crashed on top of the house that day.{nl}I am regretful that I wasn't even able to properly bury her.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000303	Alex
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000304	I am also afraid that I'll be attacked like Mr. Curtis.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000305	{nl}He was attacked by monsters a while ago when trying to drive them out of town.{nl}I can still see him in pain because of the wounds.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000306	If it wasn't for Medzio Diena, I would have married my love and be living a happy life...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000307	Wickens
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000308	It wasn't too long after I came here.{nl}Waltas was stealing for his wife and baby.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000309	{nl}He used to be someone that always looked out for other people...{nl}I realized that people change in harsh circumstances after seeing that.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000310	I do somewhat understand why Waltas was stealing.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000470	The reasoning behind selecting{nl}the particular locations is as follows.{nl}{nl}The masses are only a little less interested{nl}about riches such as treasure and gold{nl}than they are about the Goddesses.{nl}{nl}We will start with the legends of Alembique.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000471	Chapter 1 Legends of Alembique{nl}-{nl}There are tales of a cave named Alembique{nl}in the southern province of Kiren.{nl}{nl}It is said that a brilliant alchemist{nl}created many invaluable goods{nl}and occasionally invited people{nl}to show off to them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000472	Nobody seems to know the location{nl}of the mysterious Alembique Cave.{nl}{nl}However, older people in several villages{nl}tell their descendants of being invited to the cave,{nl}and not wanting to leave the place{nl}as they had experienced never before seen luxuries.{nl}{nl}Therefore, people from these villages{nl}have a habit of congratulating any people that have gone missing{nl}and hope that they will also be invited one day.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000473	The Cave of Legends : Revised Edition Volume 2
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000474	The reasoning behind selecting{nl}the particular locations is as follows.{nl}{nl}The masses are only a little less interested{nl}about riches such as treasure and gold{nl}than they are about the Goddesses.{nl}{nl}We will now go on to the hidden Royal Mausoleum.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000475	Chapter 2 : Legends of the Hidden Royal Mausoleum{nl}-{nl}The Great Woodlands have been used by the nobles and public alike{nl}as hunting grounds or refuge thanks to their lush vegetation.{nl}As such, it is an inevitability that people have experience.{nl}However, the funny thing is{nl}there is no account related to the royal family.{nl}According to some rumors,{nl}the reason for lack of accounts is because after Taniel II era.{nl}Many offerings were buried in the secret mausoleum.
	
{nl}그런데 이상하게도 왕실과 관련된{nl}이야기는 없는데 그 이유가{nl}타니엘 2세 시대에 이곳에{nl}비밀 왕릉을 만든 후 엄청난{nl}부장품을 함께 묻었기 때문이라는{nl}소문이 있습니다.	
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000476	What I am saying is that{nl}the Royalty seemed to leave this place alone{nl}as there was a secret place here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000477	To be frank, record of Taniel the Second's funeral{nl}are extremely sparse{nl}which lends extra credibility to these claims.{nl}That is because the other funerals{nl}had some sort of records{nl}no matter how small.{nl}However, even if these claims are true{nl}the Mausoleum will never see the light of day.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000478	The location of the secret mausoleum remains hidden{nl}for it is almost impossible to avoid{nl}the gaze of  Goddess Medeina.{nl}That is why even if the rumors are true, it is likely that it will remain just a legend.
	
아무리 깊은 숲속에서 몰래{nl}왕릉의 위치를 캐고 다니고 싶어도{nl}대삼림지대를 돌보시는 {nl}메데이나 여신의눈을{nl}피하기는 어렵기 때문입니다.{nl}그러므로 이 소문은 설령{nl}사실이라도 영원히 전설로만{nl}남을 것 같습니다.	
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000479	The Cave of Legends : Revised Edition Volume 3
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000480	The reasoning behind selecting{nl}the particular locations is as follows.{nl}{nl}The masses are only a little less interested{nl}about riches such as treasure and gold{nl}than they are about the Goddesses.{nl}{nl}We will continue with the legends of the Golden Veins of Barconsi.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000481	Chapter 3 : The Golden Veins of Barconsi{nl}-{nl}There are tales that there is a legendary gold vein{nl}in the rural mountains of the Kingdom.{nl}It is said that a demon had found this vein{nl}and a hero defeated the demon before claiming it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000482	It is also said that the hero{nl}only took the vein to prevent the demon from using it{nl}and had no interest in using it for himself.{nl}That is why he buried the location forever.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000483	The hero eventually passed away from old age{nl}and left no children leaving the gold{nl}up for anyone to take if they could find it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000484	However, there is something suspicious{nl}about this legend.{nl}There is no record of Barconsi,{nl}the hero who supposedly took the gold from the demon{nl}in any of the Kingdom's records.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000485	As such, many people believe that{nl}this legend is fictional{nl}as there is no record of Barconsi.{nl}However, they do not try to explain{nl}why Barconsi's name is involved.{nl}Of course, there are also many people{nl}that keep searching for the gold.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000486	Refugee Brandon
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000487	I should have listened when everyone was telling me off!{nl}This forest is dangerous!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000488	I don't understand why that hunter would want to keep this forest for himself.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000489	Umm, could you help me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000490	{nl}I barely managed to get out of a trap, but I hurt my leg and can't go any further.{nl}Please help me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000491	There's some Whitetailed Grass at Turas Lot... They say it will relieve pain.{nl}I think I'll manage to walk if I'm chewing on that.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000492	There should be some in the surrounding area.{nl}Could you get some for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000493	Thank you so much.{nl}I'm going to get out of here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000494	{nl}There seems to be a violent hunter that wants to claim this land as his own.{nl}I doubted that until I got caught in one of his traps.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000495	{nl}From what I've heard, he's known to have tamed a beast in order to chase people off...{nl}You should avoid getting any deeper into the forest as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000496	I thought you were simply a nosy adventurer, but you seem to be a cut above the rest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000497	Let me introduce myself.{nl}My name is Vilhelmas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000498	{nl}I used to be a member... Actually, let's forget about the past since it's not important.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000499	{nl}Emmet Forest has only been recently discovered.{nl}It seems like a good place for refugees, so I was getting rid of the troublesome monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000500	{nl}There's also a beast here...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000501	{nl}You know, the rumors are mostly true... Apart from those about me of course.{nl}I am on my way to get rid of that beast.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000502	I appreciate the thought but... I'll have to see your skill before I'll allow it.{nl}I don't want there to be your blood on my hands.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000503	Their saying that I tamed the beast to chase people off?{nl}That's really disheartening...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000504	I never thought you would be a Revelator...{nl}Maybe the fact that you came here was also a plan of a Goddess or two.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000505	I thought that you were skilled, but never thought that you were a Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000506	As I told you before, this is a good place for people to live.{nl}This means that this is a good place for the refugees from the Old Capital.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000507	{nl}First of all, the Kugheri must be removed in order for people to settle here.{nl}But we'll have to deal with the beast before we can tackle the Kugheri.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000508	{nl}I was getting tired of tracking him because of the curse anyways.{nl}I'd appreciate it if you could help me a bit...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000509	{nl}Of course, the beast is more than capable, which means that there will be casualties if you're not strong enough.{nl}Would you mind if I test your skills?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000510	It wasn't long after I started dealing with the Kugheri.{nl}One of the demons came crashing through Emmet Forest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000511	{nl}I don't care what a demon would come here for.{nl}I simply took care of it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000512	{nl}It was relatively easy defeating it.{nl}But there were complications.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000513	{nl}He cursed me when he was cornered.{nl}My sight is severely hindered due to that stupid curse.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000514	{nl}Anyways, he put a red gem through himself after that.{nl}He started to transform after that.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000515	{nl}I'm sure you might have guessed from listening up to this point, but the beast is the demon.{nl}I realized at once that the demon was much more dangerous than before.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000516	{nl}Of course, he had a bit of fear left for me and ran as well.{nl}The long and boring fight between the two of us has been dragging on ever since then.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000517	{nl}Tracking that thing with this curse wasn't easy.{nl}Having limited vision as a hunter is  almost a death sentance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000518	{nl}I put up warnings to ward people away but refugees kept coming in despite of my efforts.{nl}I think I'll be able to settle this fight once and for all with your help though.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000519	{nl}Please, lend me your strength.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000520	Very good.{nl}Try dealing with the Kugheri of this forest.{nl}If you are able to deal with them, you might be good enough to take on the beast with me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000521	Please prove your skills by dealing with the Kugheri.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000522	Hmm... You are definitely skilled.{nl}I think I'll be able to defeat the beast if I fight with you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000523	{nl}You're a bit too good...{nl}You're not just the average traveler are you? What are you?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000524	So you're the...!{nl}Now I understand your skill.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000525	{nl}Well then Revelator, you should help me out with a problem I have here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000526	I think we'll give that idea a try since I have someone to help me now.{nl}I think we'll be able to critically injure the beast.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000527	{nl}The plan is to plant a trap where he normally travels and then for me to hit the beast with a poison arrow.{nl}I'll have to gather ingredients for the poison, but I can't do this alone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000528	{nl}The first ingredient for the poison can be taken from the Kugheri.{nl}I can't see them until I get near them, but they run if I get too close.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000529	{nl}Could you gather the ingredients for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000530	Thank you.{nl}You'll be able to get the poison from Kugheri Tots.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000531	{nl}They seem to have poison for protection purposes when they're young, but simply taking that poison won't be enough.{nl}The poison will become much more potent if you spray them with this stimulant.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000532	{nl}Defeat them and bring me the enhanced poison sacks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000533	Approach the Kugheri Tots and defeat them after spraying them with stimulant.{nl}Take the poison sacks from them after defeating them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000534	Good job.{nl}You'll have to move with me for the next ingredient.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000535	The next ingredient is the Yellow Wolfsbane.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000536	{nl}However, we can't use any flower.{nl}Only a professional will be able to see which flower can be used.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000537	{nl}I'll decide which flowers can be used since you won't be able to tell the difference.{nl}All you have to do is lead me to the flowers since I can't see where they are.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000538	They should be growing near Saalmas Falls.{nl}We should get moving at once.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000539	Thank you.{nl}I'll start mixing the poison.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000540	We have enough ingredients for the poison now.{nl}However...{nl}I seem to be fresh out of materials for the traps.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000541	{nl}The Kugheri Sommi always carry paralysis poison to use on small animals.{nl}It can be used on larger targets if you have enough of it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000542	{nl}Could you gather the poison from them?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000543	Thank you.{nl}I'll be making other preparations.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000544	Bring me paralysis poison gathered from the Kugheri Sommi.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000545	That took longer than expected.{nl}Let's go and finish the trap.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000546	We're all set to go.{nl}I just have to install this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000547	I tracked the beast and mixed the poison while you were gathering the poison for the trap.{nl}He leaves a red trail behind him. It may be a bit faint for you to see.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000548	{nl}I think it's because of the red gem he put through himself.{nl}Anyways, I found a small trail where he frequently goes by.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000549	{nl}I think we should install the trap on the way up to Saalmas Falls from Tredhalai Stream.{nl}I'll be hiding at Visuobene Falls and hit him with the poison arrow as soon as he is trapped.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000550	{nl}It should be enough to critically injure the beast.{nl}All you have to do is install the trap where I just described.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000551	Make sure to install it exactly where I described.{nl}I won't be able to hit him if it's not in the correct place.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000552	Go and install the trap before the beast goes through.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000553	I'll have to rest here for a bit.{nl}Vaighe Hill is a dead end so we won't have to worry too much. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000554	{nl}You'll have to end it by yourself.{nl}It should have been weakened considerably because of the poison arrow.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000555	Don't worry about me and go after it!{nl}Before it can recover!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000556	He's gone to a dead end.{nl}This is the opportune moment to finish it!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000557	We should recover all of the traps we set to catch the beast.{nl}We can't have people like you stepping on them now can we?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000558	May the Goddess bless your journey.{nl}I hope you will be able to succeed in your mission.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000559	I won't be caught out by the Kugheri even if I am wounded.{nl}Hurry after him and finish the job.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000560	Yes...{nl}The long fight has finally come to an end.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000561	{nl}I don't know when this would have ended if it wasn't for you.{nl}I think my eyesight is returning now that the beast is gone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000562	{nl}I owe you.{nl}I would appreciate it if you could stay behind and help me clean this place up...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000563	{nl}I'm sure you have your mission as Revelator.{nl}I don't know how I'll repay you for the help you gave.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000564	{nl}Farewell then.{nl}I wish you the best on your journey.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000565	Anyone who goes beyond this point will put their life at risk.{nl}Go back while you still can.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000566	I advise you to be careful as there are violent Kugheri and armed traps.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000567	Refugee Mylija
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000568	I came here after hearing that it was okay, but I think it was a bad decision on my part.{nl}Monsters are crawling everywhere... People are fighting amongst each other...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000569	I can't beliece that it's been four years since Medzio Diena and they're still fighting over stupid land.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000570	At least they're talking to each other instead of simply fighting.{nl}I wish we could know who to rely on soon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000571	I hope that everything will be finished without bloodshed.{nl}I'm a bit worried that there may be complications since they don't exactly have a good history together.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000572	I am thankful that the argument is over since they've decided to help us even if they haven't decided the winner.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000573	Thank you for your help Traveler.{nl}This was all thanks to you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000574	Ah, it's you...{nl}Could you help us out?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000575	{nl}The food we've brought with us is long gone...{nl}We've asked the lords supposed to be ruling this region, but they are too busy squabbling between themselves to help us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000576	{nl}Since you seem to be capable of dealing with some monsters, we have no choice but to ask you...{nl}Could you please gather some tailfruit from the Yellow Leafnuts after dealing with them?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000577	Thank you.{nl}I think all that's left to eat around these parts are the tailfruits from the Leafnuts.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000578	Please gather some tailfruit from the Yellow Leafnuts in the surrounding area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000579	Thank you so much.{nl}We'll manage for a while with these but... I hope that they'll decide who will rule this region as soon as possible...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000580	Refugee Greg
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000581	We came all the way here for help but have to fend for ourselves...{nl}This makes this place exactly like anywhere else.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000582	How could they be squabbling over land in such situations...{nl}I guess I can't expect any better from nobles can I...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000583	Well, at least they're better than the average noble.{nl}It seems like they've caught on to the situation after being attacked by monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000584	I heard that you were the reason behind their sudden agreement.{nl}I don't know how I will repay you for this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000585	Monsters are attacking us refugees a few times every single day.{nl}What's the use of having a lot of soldiers nearby.{nl}They're all busy protecting their lords.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000586	{nl}Even worse, they don't care if the refugees here die or not.{nl}All they seem to care about is getting more land under their boots.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000587	{nl}That's why we have to look for ways to look after ourselves.{nl}I'm sorry, but could you please get us some strong branches from the nearby area?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000588	{nl}We're planning on having them as weapons.{nl}I will have to stay here in order to carve their points to use as weapons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000589	Thank you so much for offering your help.{nl}We've already taken this much from the surrounding area, so you'll have to look over at Collegia Crossing for more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000590	{nl}There's always monsters near branches, so please be careful out there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000591	Be wary of monsters when collecting branches.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000592	Thank you.{nl}They all look very sturdy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000593	{nl}However, they are still just tree branches... We won't last long with these.{nl}We need the fighting between the two lords to end soon...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000594	{nl}Only the Goddess will know if they'll care about us even if it does end soon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000595	I saw you helping Greg.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000596	{nl}I've seen you helping us out and dealing with monsters with ease...{nl}You don't seem to be just an ordinary traveler.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000597	{nl}We... we'll have to leave this place if the lords don't stop arguing soon.{nl}However, we are afraid of going into Emmet Forest because of the warnings and strange rumors about the place.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000598	{nl}In other words, we don't have anywhere to go.{nl}So, please, could you find it in your heart to go and mediate?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000599	You'll help us right?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000600	{nl}Ah, thank the Goddesses...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000601	{nl}I'm sure that you'll manage to persuade them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000602	{nl}Lord Ryudhas is ruling over the land in place of his sick brother.{nl}He is a very stubborn man.{nl}He's staying at Dhuvus Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000603	{nl}Lord Joquvas is a young lad who has recently come into power.{nl}He is at Nevhrandi Crossroads with his tutor.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000604	{nl}We always get turned away every time we go near them.{nl}Please go and talk some sense into them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000605	Lord Ryudhas is at Dhuvus Lot,{nl}Lord Joquvas is at Nevhrandi Crossroads.{nl}Please convince them to stop arguing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000606	That was incredible!{nl}I didn't think that you'd be able to convince both of them...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000607	Lord Ryudhas
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000608	Not anyone can simply go and talk to a lord.{nl}That has not changed despite how the rest of the world has changed since Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000609	I am currently running my family's business in my brother's place as he is ill.{nl}I will not ignore anyone who is threatening my family's rule.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000610	You have my word since you have dutifully carried out the tasks I have set for you.{nl}I will attempt to talk to Joquvas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000611	All I promise is to attempt to talk.{nl}The fact that this is my family's land is not something that can be compromised.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000612	Who are you to stand in front of me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000613	{nl}You are all as useless as a Kepa.{nl}How dare you allow this outsider to come near me...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000614	{nl}I suppose you have a reason why you've decided to interrupt me?{nl}What business do you have with me, the representative for Lord Ryudhas?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000615	The reason I am fighting with the Joquvas lad?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000616	{nl}It's not even really a fight.{nl}I am simply notifying him of my family's right.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000617	{nl}I have in my possession an official document that proves my right to the land here.{nl}That miserable lad is merely being a nuisance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000618	{nl}I am not as compromising as my brother.{nl}This is the rightful land of the Ryudhas family.{nl}I will not back down.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000619	I was wondering what sort of nonsense you would tell me.{nl}Why do I need to talk to the lad about my rightful land?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000620	{nl}You've been asked by the refugees...?{nl}The refugees over there?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000621	{nl}Well, I suppose I cannot simply ignore the requests of my people as lord of this land.{nl}I might consider your request if you complete some tasks I set for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000622	{nl}A few of my men seem to have caught a plague.{nl}They must be cured before it can spread so go and fetch me some roots from the Pysis plant.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000623	Go and fetch me some Pystis roots from nearby.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000624	Good.{nl}However, we need more to craft the medicine we need.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000625	Ryudhas Guard
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000626	Get back from our lord!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000627	You are standing in front of Lord Ryudhas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000628	Another ingredient is needed to craft the medicine. The legs of the Orange Grummer.{nl}Of course, you'll need to forcefully take it from them, so it may be too much for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000629	{nl}Of course, I can simply give this task to another person if you don't want to do it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000630	Hmm... I am surprised.{nl}I don't know who you are, but why are you working so hard for the refugees?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000631	{nl}Well, whatever the case, fine.{nl}If you have decided to accept the task, go fetch me the Orange Grummer legs.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000632	My men will be able to be treated if you get me those Orange Grummer legs.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000633	You seem to be more efficient than you look.{nl}If you keep up the good work, I may consider making more personal requests.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000634	This is not only my family's land but also land that I have many found memories about.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000635	{nl}There is a tree at Atmintis Lot where my brother and I used to see how tall we were.{nl}I wish to retrieve a toy box buried under it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000636	{nl}However, it's located where the lad from Joquvas is claiming as his own, so my soldiers cannot go.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000637	{nl}I doubt he will be alarmed at you rummaging around.{nl}Could you get that box for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000638	{nl}I wish to take it to my ill brother.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000639	Good.{nl}I will consider talking to the lad if you get me that box.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000640	{nl}I suppose that the tree will still have the marks from when we were young but...{nl}From the state of the trees nearby, I think that it will also be covered in moss.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000641	{nl}The fluid of the Red Colimen has strong acidic properties so gather that first.{nl}After that, go and liquidify the moss on the trees and check for any marks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000642	{nl}It you find a tree with marks, dig underneath it for a box.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000643	Go and get rid of the moss on trees at Atmintis Lot for a tree with marks.{nl}Dig under it to get a box.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000644	This brings up memories.{nl}It is the same as I remember it even if it is a bit worn.{nl}I will listen to your request since you have kept your end of the deal.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000645	{nl}I will send a person to Joquvas.{nl}I will not press any harder if the Joquvas lad refuses to talk.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000646	Lord Joquvas
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000647	You lowly thing!{nl}How dare you speak to me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000648	If you have business worthy of my time, tell it to Roberta.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000649	Roberta says that it is fine to listen even if it does not effect my decision.{nl}Therefore, I shall listen to what you have to say.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000650	If the refugees wish to receive my help, isn't it correct to recognize me as the rightful owner of this land first?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000651	You must go through me if you have anything to say to Lord Joquvas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000652	I have taught our lord since he was young.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000653	{nl}As such, I have his absolute trust.{nl}You will have to convince me in order to convince our lord.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000654	I keep my promises.{nl}I will convince our lord in order to have a conversation with the other side.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000655	However, I don't understand.{nl}Why is a simple traveler so interested in the requests of mere refugees?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000656	{nl}It's not like you're a Savior or anything.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000657	Of course, there would have been no doubt about this land belonging to the Joquvas family...{nl}But I suppose there is no choice but to change along with the times.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000658	I will convince our lord to be more mindful of the refugees once the new boundaries are settled.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000659	Joquvas Guard
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000660	Talk to Robertas if you have any business.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000661	Don't you dare approach Lord Joquvas!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000662	What is this man?{nl}Get back I tell you!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000663	Please calm yourself.{nl}Traveler, you must go through me if you have any business with our lord.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000664	I am our lords most humble servant, Roberta.{nl}What is your business?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000665	Who do you think you to speak to the lord?{nl}Talk to Roberta if you have any business!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000666	Not anyone can simply come to speak to our lord.{nl}You must be seen as worthy of his attention before I consider telling him your business.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000667	{nl}It is not too difficult.{nl}Simply go and deal with some pesky Red Colimen and I will consider your request.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000668	Go and deal with the Red Colimen.{nl}I shall listen to you after that.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000669	Good.{nl}Now, shall we listen to what you have to speak of?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000670	Negotiations with the representative of Lord Ryudhas... You have brought me an annoying task.{nl}Our lord is embarrassed by the fact that he is facing a man that isn't even an actual lord.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000671	{nl}However, I don't think we can simply ignore this.{nl}I don't think that the refugees recognize the true lord either...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000672	{nl}I suppose that we will need to show more solid evidence.{nl}If you bring me what I ask of you, I will consider convincing our lord to listen to you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000673	You'll be able to see some wreckage near Arcmnys Lake.{nl}It used to be the residence of our grounds keeper.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000674	{nl}There should be objects around there with the seal of the Joquvas family there.{nl}We can't go there because of the Ryudhas soldiers, so you'll have to go and retrieve them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000675	Look for objects belonging to the Joquvas family near the wreckage at Arcmnys Lake.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000676	That is... a shield.{nl}I can confirm that there is a seal of the Joquvas family on it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000677	{nl}Very good, but this will not be enough.{nl}I believe that you must help with another task before I recognize you as worthy of audience.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000678	The Joquvas family always set up Monument made of stone.{nl}We will be able to make the refugees accept the Joquvas family as the rightful rulers.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000679	{nl}We've found a few places that the monuments might be, but we can't go there.{nl}We can't remove any of the soldiers from guarding our lord because of all the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000680	{nl}We don't know when the soldiers from Ryudhas might attack either...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000681	{nl}From the look of things, you are skilled enough to protect me if you accompany me while I investigate the Monuments.{nl}Would you mind accompanying me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000682	Good. We'll have to check Paccituche Trail, Skalda Road and Lyfetie Cliffs.{nl}Shall we go then?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000683	Good work.{nl}The refugees will now know who the rightful owner of this land is.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000684	{nl}Ah... I will try and talk to our lord about what you have told me.{nl}A promise is a promise.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000685	{nl}However, we will only agree to simple conversation.{nl}There is no doubt in the fact that this land belongs to the Joquvas family.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000686	There's a slight issue.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000687	{nl}Before you came back, the lords started negotiations in the lot just over there.{nl}The atmosphere isn't friendly though...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000688	{nl}I think you may want to go and take a look.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000689	The lords are meeting in the lot nearby.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000690	I think I had been forgetting something very important while I focused on the land.{nl}We, the Ryudhas family, will support the refugees here with all available resources.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000691	I never thought the monsters would be so strong.{nl}Did they not attack us properly the entire time?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000692	I don't like it, but I suppose I don't have a choice since we decided on the new boundaries.{nl}There will be no more fighting with the Ryudhas family.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000693	Roberta should now how to take care of the refugees.{nl}I will listen to Roberta's advice as always.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000694	My men... All of them have perished!{nl}I owe my life to you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000695	{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000696	I never thought the monsters would be so strong!{nl}Thank the goddesses I didn't bring Roberta.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000697	Yes... This is not the time for us to argue over the land.{nl}We must stand together and fight back the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000698	It is as you have told me.{nl}We will be able to focus on ruling our land since the boundaries have been set.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000699	While I do think that this is my family's land...{nl}I suppose one should know how to take a step back under such circumstances.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000700	{nl}Ah well.{nl}I will negotiate with the Ryudhas about the new boundaries.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000701	The negotiations are over.{nl}We have decided to use this road as the boundary.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000702	{nl}We have decided to take care of the refugees now that the conflict has been settled.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000703	The lad is more agreeable than I thought he would be.{nl}We have decided to care for the refugees since the new boundary has been set.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000704	We will install notifications on the new boundary.{nl}I think that setting one at Pastoghe Bend, Collegia Crossing and Paccituche Trail should be enough.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000705	{nl}You have done well as mediator.{nl}I give my word that I will take care of the refugees.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000706	I don't like the results, but what can be done?{nl}The Ryudhas also had some good points in their arguements.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000707	The Kukheri Tribe and demons...{nl}Investigating Syla Forest has become much more dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000708	What I am attempting to do has the lives of many people on the line.{nl}However, it is... extremely difficult. I would appreciate it if I could get some help but...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000709	I can't believe I am receiving the help of a Revelator here. It seems as if the Goddesses have not forsaken the Kingdom yet.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000710	I think that the ancient knowledge from the Royal Mausoleum of Taniel the Second will help the reconstruction of the Kingdom.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000711	Vhalterris was a powerful and tenacious demon.{nl}I doubt that anyone other than the Revelators would have been able to take Vhalterris down.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000712	There shouldn't be anything in Taniel the Second's Royal Mausoleum fit for demons to go after...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000713	{nl}I can't fathom what they wanted from that place...{nl}Simply the interferance of the Kingdom's reconstruction? The assumption that a Revelator would be there?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000714	Hmm?{nl}You must be quite skilled to make it this far.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000715	{nl}My name is Indraja, an adventurer.{nl}I have received a request to go and investigate places where the refugees might stay while the Kingdom is being reconstructed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000716	{nl}I never thought that I would run into demons here.{nl}My bodyguard, Marcus, was wounded while protecting me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000717	{nl}I would like to prevent the monsters from getting closer.{nl}Could you please help us a bit?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000718	Thank you.{nl}We sprinkled liquid that the Kugheri Tribe dislikes, but it doesn't seem to be enough.{nl}We have the ingredients to make more, but we are out of water.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000719	{nl}It is said that the Syla Dandelion holds dew in it's flowers.{nl}Could you please gather the dew from the flowers?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000720	Please bring me the dew from Syla Dandelions.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000721	Thank you.{nl}We'll be able to rest a bit easier thanks to you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000722	{nl}While I realize that this may be rude... I must ask... {nl}Looking at your skill and appearance... Are youa Revelator?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000723	I thought you might be.{nl}I have heard many stories.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000724	{nl}This is an honor.{nl}If you are a Revelator, I should tell you my real mission.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000725	Marcus
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000726	Do not approach...!{nl}This person is on an important mission!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000727	Kukheri Tribe...{nl}They have become much stronger in a short time...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000728	I have heard many rumors...{nl}I hope that you will find it in your heart to help...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000729	You are already being trusted by many people...{nl}You will be able to earn the trust of Royalty if you help with this mission.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000730	Let me introduce myself once more.{nl}I am not an adventurer.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000731	{nl}I am here on the orders of General Lhamin who is attempting to reconstruct the Kingdom.{nl}It is to find Taniel the Second's Royal Mausoleum which is rumored to be in Syla Forest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000732	{nl}Marcus is an officer here to protect me but he has been wounded.{nl}Please, could you help me finish my mission?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000733	Thank you.{nl}We were attacked by the Kugheri on behalf of the demons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000734	We knew that they didn't like humans, but we didn't know that they would attack us with such numbers.{nl}They must have made an agreement with the demons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000735	{nl}They are sure to be searching for us nearby.{nl}Please reduce their numbers a bit.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000736	General Lhamin is trying to reconstruct the Kingdom.{nl}He wishes to utilize anything possible to do so.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000737	{nl}He had come across a legend that had been passed down by Royalty.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000738	{nl}It is said that Taniel the Second had created another Royal Mausoleum.{nl}It is said that much information was stored there to prepare for some sort of catastrophe.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000739	{nl}The General firmly believes that the information stored there will be of great help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000740	{nl}It is said that you must be of Royal descent in order to find the Royal Mausoleum's entrance.{nl}That's why I have been honorably chosen as a far relative of the Royalty.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000741	{nl}However, I never thought that the demons would be searching for the Royal Mausoleum as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000742	{nl}There were two demons, but I spread misinformation and made one to to Emmet Forest.{nl}The other followed us here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000743	{nl}We wouldn't have been able to continue on our mission if we hadn't met you here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000744	Please deal with the Kugheri Zeuni and Kugheri Zabbi that are after us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000745	Thank you.{nl}However, we won't be able to rest easy until we deal with the demon behind them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000746	You have something for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000747	{nl}...{nl}These are the orders from the demon!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000748	{nl}I don't know how the Kugheri were able to read this.{nl}I have learned of their language, so let me take a look and try to make something of it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000749	I wasn't able to decipher the orders you brought me.{nl}I am sure that there are more orders...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000750	{nl}Maybe I'll be able to make sense of them if I am able to compare and contrast the letters.{nl}I'm sorry, but could you please get me more of the demon's orders?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000751	Thank you. You said that you gathered them from the Kugheri Zabbi?{nl}Please get me more of them from the Kugheri Zabbi on the road to Stabhas Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000752	The Kugheri Zabbi should have more orders.{nl}I might be able to make some sense of it with more references.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000753	Thank you.{nl}I'll try to figure out what the demon was scheming.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000754	I've looked at all of the material you brought me.{nl}Where to begin...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000755	{nl}It is said that the demon going after the Royal Mausoleum is called Vhalterris.{nl}Unlike his colleague, he has been chasing us quite cleverly.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000756	{nl}Marcus allowed us to both escape but...{nl}We lost a chest related to the Royal Mausoleum's secret.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000757	{nl}According to these orders, it seems as if he has yet to unravel the secret held within that chest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000758	{nl}Revelator.{nl}I know that this is a difficult request, but could you please retrieve that chest for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000759	Thank you.{nl}He seems to be wondering around Apeighos Altar since he was unable to unravel the secret.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000760	Please retrieve the chest after defeating Vhalterris.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000761	Thank you.{nl}We've been able to get the chest back and remove the demon at the same time thanks to you!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000762	Now we'll be able to focus on searching for the entrance.{nl}However, there is something more I should tell you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000763	{nl}We will only be able to find the entrance if we solve various puzzles.{nl}The chest you brought back is the start of the puzzles.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000764	{nl}An important clue is stored in the chest you retrieved, but it will not simply open.{nl}We will have to learn how to open it with the five colors on this lock.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000765	{nl}According to legend, there are five trees near the hidden entrance of the Royal Mausoleum, and those trees will indicate different colors.{nl}I can't leave Marcus behind, so could you please survey the trees instead?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000766	Here, take this engraving and map.{nl}This engraving, which has the Royal Seal, is said to have magic infused on it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000767	{nl}It is said to be part of a set with the box and will react to the trees there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000768	{nl}The map is supposed to have the location of the trees marked on it.{nl}Go to each tree marked on the map and see which colors it reacts to.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000769	Go to the trees marked on the map and use the Royal Seal to see how they react to each tree.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000770	I sent Marcus back to Fedimian since he recovered enough to travel by himself.{nl}How is your investigation going?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000771	{nl}Red... and blue...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000772	{nl}Ah...!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000773	{nl}Of course!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000774	{nl}I think I know how to open it!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000775	The chest has opened!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000776	{nl}Let's see here... There's a stone slate.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000777	{nl}Let me see what it says.{nl}Hmm...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000778	Grasp the time at which you are granted audience with the King.{nl}The guardian will appear as the King looks down upon your last light.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000779	{nl}Ah... This seems to be another riddle.{nl}We should go to Lykhas Crossroads since it's mentioned in the records and go see what can be found.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000780	There was a bit more content on the slate...{nl}It seems as if it requires the blood from royalty to be read.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000781	{nl}I suppose this was the reason they needed royalty to find the entrance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000782	{nl}However, the seal seems to be damaged since it has been passed down for generations.{nl}It seems to have consumed all of it's magic when you where investigating the trees.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000783	{nl}We'll have to look for a way to recharge the seal.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000784	All that's left is to find the Royal Mausoleum's entrance since we've seen the guardian.{nl}Please stick around a little bit more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000785	I don't know too much about how it's working, but I do think that it's impressive they created such seals a few hundred years ago.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000786	I was able to finish General Lhamin's mission thanks to you.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000787	We'll need to reseal this Royal Mausoleum to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000788	I have no idea on how to recharge the magic though...{nl}Do you have any good ideas?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000789	Will that work?{nl}I somehow feel as if this isn't your first time doing this...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000790	{nl}Well, let's try your idea then.{nl}Please fill the seal with Kugheri Tribe souls.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000791	Please fill the seal with Kugheri Tribe souls.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000792	However, we can't go into the Royal Mausoleum like this.{nl}We'll need to report back to the General and get a proper survey team here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000793	{nl}Leaving the entrance open like this won't do though...{nl}We shoul reseal the entrance now that we know where it's exact location is now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000794	{nl}Could you help me a bit more?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000795	We can't use the Royal Seal to reseal the entrance...{nl}Especially since there's a risk of it being destroyed...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000796	{nl}We'll have to find something to replace it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000797	{nl}The Kugheri Numani carry staffs adorned with bells that they use for their rituals.{nl}I'm sure that the bells have some sort of power that allows them to use their magic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000798	{nl}I'll look for a way to reseal the entrance while you gather the staffs.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000799	Please gather me the staffs from the Kugheri Numani from the surrounding area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000800	Good job.{nl}I hope this works... 
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000801	{nl}I hope the staffs you gathered will contain enough magic...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000802	It worked!{nl}The Royal Mausoleum entrance has been resealed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000803	{nl}I wasn't sure if this would work.{nl}I'll be able to return and report without worrying too much now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000804	The entrance has been resealed.{nl}However, there are still a few of the Kugheri Tribe that know where the entrance is located.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000805	{nl}We need to make sure that the location doesn't get into the hands of any demons.{nl}Please make sure there aren't any loose ends.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000806	There will still be some Kugheri that followed Vhalterris.{nl}Please deal with them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000807	It seems as if most of the Kugheri that had followed Vhalterris have been dealt with.{nl}Please make sure that there are no more loose ends and deal with the rest of the Kugheri Tribe.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000808	This information must be kept from getting into the hands of the demons.{nl}Please prevent the Kugheri Tribe from talking.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000809	Good job.{nl}However, there are still some Kugheri that had followed Vhalterris.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000810	It may seem a bit extreme, but they brought this upon themselves when they decided to cooperate with the demons.{nl}Anyhow, this should be enough.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000811	{nl}The Kugheri Tribe here will not be able to talk so easily now...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000812	{nl}It seems as if I keep owing you.{nl}If you ever get the chance to see General Lhamin, please remember to stop by and say hello.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000817	I don't have the faintest clue as to why goblins might want parchment.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000818	I had no idea that there would be such a monster threatening the goblins.{nl}Whatever the case may be, we were able to finish up quickly thanks to your help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000819	I think the end of this mission is in sight.{nl}We'll start preparing to head back as soon as all of my men get back.
