ETC_20151022_015923	Lapemiter is a unique occupation that is highly respected, but is also looked down upon among Lapes. A Lapemiter serves a religious role, but the other Lapes don't put great emphasis on religious rituals, so they want a Lapemiter to do their exhausting duty.
ETC_20151022_015924	Unlike the prejudice of the humans, Lapezards are not Lapes that obtained their current status through long training. Most of them are selected by their breeds and they grow up accordingly and receive the necessary food to become a Lapezard.
ETC_20151022_015925	Their status is not high among Lapes, but they are most dangerous and they get encountered often. To receive respect from the other Lapes, they act violently to the ones they encounter with.
ETC_20151022_015926	For a Lape to Lapflammer, they just need to obtain the weapons they need. But its not that easy since when Lapflammers die, the weapons also get destroyed so its not that easy for the Lapes.
ETC_20151022_015927	Ferret Archers usually engages in battles, but they sometimes shoot down the fruits on tall trees. It's not that other ferrets asked them to do it, but they just do that for fun when they are not engaged in battles.
ETC_20151022_015928	They sometimes move the objects, but they usually share the processed fruit products to other ferrets. It is unknown whether they receive any rewards for that or they are responsible to do so.
ETC_20151022_015929	They look small, but they are matured ferrets. They sometimes become other ferrets depending on the properties of the breeds and the environment that they live in.
ETC_20151022_015930	This ferret does not possess any distinct characteristic. But due to long labor, they possess strong power, so you should not underestimate it.
ETC_20151022_015931	Ferret Empty Porter
ETC_20151022_015932	They do work while supervising the works of other ferrets.
ETC_20151022_015933	This ferret is responsible for looking for other enemies and useful fruits.
ETC_20151022_015934	Like Ferret Archers, they either attack enemies or shoot down the fruits. One advantage they have over archers is that they sometimes use hard fruits as bullets.
ETC_20151022_015935	Ferret Supply Soldier
ETC_20151022_015936	This ferret has an inferior status compared to the other ferrets. This ferret helps with the works of other ferrets and they also participate in battles.

ETC_20151224_017670	Saltistters live in cold, rugged areas so their amount hardly increases. The instances where they appear in diverse transformations like Saltisdaughter are of course, after Medzio Diena.
ETC_20151224_017671	After Medzio Diena, as the environment turned favorable to the Goblins, their number increased and they wanted to invade the land of the humans. For your reference, Woodgoblins and goblins are not directly related.
ETC_20151224_017672	By looking at the spear Ticen is carrrying, the assumption that there may be other kinds of Ticens out there turned out to be true and many kinds of Ticens were created and they are moving in a herd. They care about sociality.
ETC_20151224_017673	It is certain that Infrogalas is close to Gaigalas, but we haven't yet actually identified the origin of Gaigalas at the moment so it's origin and the birth are still unknown. However, it is fortunate that other information that is needed when fighting against it is known.

ETC_20151224_017693	A long time ago, Elet used to be a fairy or a soul. They received the curse of Goddess Ausrine and they hid into the human world and lived on. Since Medzio Diena, when the demons invaded the world, they are showing their determination to participate with the other demons.
ETC_20151224_017694	What's unique about Nuo is that they are subordinates of the Demon King Kartas. Although Kartas possesses a brutal and unexpected personality, it is so incredible that Nuo who is under the control of Kartas possesses the power and the number for the ones who know well about the circumstances in the demons.
ETC_20151224_017695	Nuka is under the control of the Demon King Vaiga and was dispatched here to fulfill the tasks that Gesti received from Giltine. But, Gesti is controlling them unlike what Vaiga once thought.

They were cooperative to demons instead of the goddesses, but they posed no big problems since their amount was small compared to humans.

Nevertheless, Hauberk still influences his servants and dreams of his resurrection and return.
ETC_20151224_017705	Lapemiter is a unique occupation that is highly respected, but is also looked down upon among Lapes. A Lapemiter serves a religious role, but the other Lapes don't put great emphasis on religious rituals, so they want a Lapemiter to do their exhausting duty.
ETC_20151022_015924	Unlike the prejudice of the humans, Lapezards are not Lapes that obtained their current status through long training. Most of them are selected by their breeds and they grow up accordingly and receive the necessary food to become a Lapezard.
ETC_20151224_017706	Their status is not high among Lapes, but they are most dangerous and they get encountered often. To receive respect from the other Lapes, they act violently to the ones they encounter with.
ETC_20151224_017707	For a Lape to Lapflammer, they just need to obtain the weapons they need. But its not that easy since when Lapflammers die, the weapons also get destroyed so its not that easy for the Lapes.

ETC_20151224_017720	Ferret Marauder
ETC_20151224_017721	We can tell Lape society is gradually becoming more complex and differentiated by looking at them distinguishing themselves from each other for even slight differences between them.

ETC_20151224_017730	We are not sure about the uses of the thorns that are on the back.

ETC_20151224_017731	Polibu eats small animals or insects and they even eats dead bodies. But, they attack humans to have just one bite so you should be cautious.
