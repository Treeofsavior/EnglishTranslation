QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000167	Revelator. If this is the will of the goddess, then you must be qualified.{nl}You have a job to do, so follow me to Beacon Hill Pass.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000168	I have made Niels and you worry...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000169	I will lead the way and you will handle any monsters we encounter.{nl}I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000170	The time is now. Please go on ahead to Beacon Hill Pass.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000171	I am sure that you are qualified for this.{nl}Goddess Laima has led all these.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000172	Finally the hidden treasure can be passed down to someone.{nl}I regret not recognizing you sooner due to my senility.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000173	Great King Zachariel told us to bestow his hidden treasure upon a qualified person.{nl}You can check whether you are qualified with the Eyes of the Great King.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000174	We have one more responsibility besides protecting the Royal Mausoleum.{nl}And that is to protect the royal inheritance until a qualified person comes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000175	We have no idea what exactly the hidden treasure is.{nl}The king just told us to protect it so we are just following his order.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000176	Medicine Dealer
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000177	Hmm... Well, there's a herb that only grows around Metos Field.{nl}Please bring me it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000178	Metos Field would be the best place to wake up one's consciousness. Especially for an old man.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000179	Good job. You're pretty sharp, aren't you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000180	Alright, it's done.{nl}Take this to Davio.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000181	Merchant Davio
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000182	I brought that old man's medicine. {nl}But I spent a great deal of effort getting it. I ought to charge you more.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000183	The gold that Lichenclops have in this town will be enough.{nl}Bring those to the Medicine Dealer in Kapas Highway.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000184	This will be enough. Davio sent you, right?{nl} I still need one more ingredient to make the medicine truly effective.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000185	To make the medicine, I needed to find the cause of Jonas' symptoms and it drove me crazy.{nl}Funnily enough, it was caused by a spell that was used long ago.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000186	I heard a rumor that the Great King Zachariel erased the memories of all workers after {nl}building the Royal Mausoleum. That should be the spell casted on Jonas, though he is also a bit {nl}senile.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000187	It was tough to get that old man's medicine.{nl}But, there's nothing I cannot get.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000188	It will be completed once you melt it in the honey that you have. Take it with you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000189	That medicine works well. Make him swallow it somehow.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000190	You're late.{nl}Did you bring my archive?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000191	Go to the Abandoned Old Workshop.{nl}Some old man is wandering around there. I think it's Jonas.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000192	What is that? It smells like mead!
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000193	I feel dizzy.{nl}What am I doing here anyway?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000194	I am relieved you found me.{nl}When the monsters were chasing after me, I lost my belongings and all the materials.{nl}At the very least, could you find the scattered materials?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000195	I don't have much to say as a humble mercenary.{nl}Although I was okay even on Medzio Diena, I am certain this place is cursed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000196	How long has it been since I came here?{nl}Where is Mirta and who are you?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000197	I'm trying to remember something but it keeps fading whenever I get close.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000198	Vaidotas
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000199	That smell.. I think the purifying device in the mine is broken.{nl}We better repair it quickly. The kidnapped villagers might suffocate.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000200	Do you know about the legend of Cunningham?{nl}The legend states that a great demon was sealed here in the Crystal Mine.{nl}There is a book with more details about it at the Mine Worker's Resting Place in Crystal Mine 2F.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000201	Anyway, my guess is that the demon is re-awakening and is controlling the Vubbes.{nl}The bishop's dream and the Legend of Cunningham... I feel they may be a sign that something{nl}huge is about to happen.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000202	Only the goddess would know if it will be hope or despair.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000203	The purifier can be easily fixed by anyone, but it may be hard to find the parts needed.{nl}In that case, use the compass that I gave you to search for them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000204	Well then, I have some things to do so I will meet you at 3F of the Crystal Mine.{nl}In the name of the goddess, I pray for success in your struggles.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000205	If you can't find the parts needed to repair the purifier, use the compass I gave you.{nl}It'll help you find them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000206	Village Aunt
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000207	You've come to save us? Right?

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000212	Mr. Juan
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000213	I get furious whenever I see those Vubbes who ruined my hometown.{nl}That's why I want to help people like you who fight against the Vubbes.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000214	I would have left already if this wasn't my hometown.{nl}Where on earth were all the Vubbes hiding before they crawled out?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000215	Pharmacist Lady
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000216	Thanks for your help last time.{nl}Without you, I would have never gotten this much ingredients.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000217	Perhaps the person that the goddess sent was you.{nl}You are the most merciful person I have ever seen among the Revelators.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000218	Soldier Jace
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000219	I will protect this village for my dead comrades.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000220	Even if the world changes, I will never forgive the Vubbes.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000222	These are the rations that we gathered from East Siauliai Woods.{nl}I will never, ever lose them again. Ever.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000223	Thanks to you, I received this much food.{nl}I am relieved.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000224	Knight Commander Uska
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000225	Is this slate the evidence of salvation?{nl}It just looks like an old slate to me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000226	Ask the mayor of the Miners' Village about a way to Leaf Veil Plateau.{nl}I will send the message to the Paladin Master first. {nl}May the blessings of goddess be with you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000227	It would be good to ask the Bokor Master to interpret this slate.{nl}She lives at the end of Klaipeda's Residential Area so go pay her a visit.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000228	Use your time wisely.{nl}No one else fully knows your future.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000229	So you finally returned.{nl}What did the Bokor Master tell you?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000230	I'm also curious about the girl who cracked the seal.{nl}This is not a seal that can easily be broken.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000231	If the Bokor Master told you that I would know it..{nl}There's one place that comes to mind.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000232	The high gardens that the goddess mentioned could be an area within Leaf Veil Plateau. {nl}I heard the Paladin Master is there, uploading a long term promise. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000233	Miners' Village Mayor
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000234	Welcome. Aren't you our town's savior?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000235	Leaf Veil Plateau, huh? If you take the road between the two bridges below, you'll reach {nl}Silverstream Gorge. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000236	So this revelation is from goddess Laima and we have to collect all these for the goddess {nl}to regain her powers?{nl}That is amazing.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000237	Oh, please do not reveal the fact that a revelation has been found unless it is absolutely necessary.{nl}Doing so may only create confusion if the rumors spread.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000238	Ah, the report.{nl}So you see, those Siaulagos were doing something strange to the supplies, {nl}then they started running away when Sparnas appeared.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000239	I was spotted by those Siaulagos as they were running away, so I fought them...{nl}And as you can see, I lost. The report, I mean.{nl}Aren't they a pain to deal with?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000240	If you find the report, please hand it over to Luders right away.{nl}Though I am terrified to think about what those bastards did to our supplies.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000241	Yes. After seeing Moody's report, I am confident that they put something in our supplies to lure {nl}Sparnas. Perhaps some Old Grains that the birds go crazy on.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000242	The soldiers on patrol found the place where the Siaulambs' stolen goods are stored.{nl}How about we steal them back?{nl}Let's make it known that we're not as weak as they think.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000243	You should fight fire with fire.{nl}We will keep attacking until they fully realize that they've made a mistake.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000244	I hope that we won't be troubled with from now on.{nl}Thanks for your efforts.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000245	The location is Ziedo Pond.{nl}I heard there are many Siaulambs, so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000246	I have not heard anything else about the bishop's dream.{nl}Sorry, I can't be of much help.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000252	Do you want to do a simple task for me?{nl}I'm a known face so it will be hard for me to do it myself.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000253	If you don't want to, then you don't have to.{nl}There are plenty of people around who can do this.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000254	You passed.{nl}The strength you possess is tremendous.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000255	It's definitely worth it.{nl}Even if the King spent all his assets building the Mausoleum, its size is huge.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000256	Judging from this, these equipment are not permitted.{nl}Do not leave them lying around.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000257	Okay. Bring me more evidence that those people are making counterfeits.{nl}Do whatever it takes.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000258	I am looking for evidence of artifact forgery.{nl}Your first task will be to bring me any illegal digging tools that you find.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000259	Of course you should show us your skills.{nl}Defeating Desert Chupacabras or Zinutes will be enough to prove yourself.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000260	Supply Officer
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000261	Thank you for your help.{nl}I think this will be enough.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000266	You mentioned that we need to assemble, right?{nl}Help me find some missing belongings and I'll go as soon as I can.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000267	Have you found my belongings yet? I can't go back without them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000268	Thank you. You found it sooner than I expected.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000269	If you follow the road to the north, you will find the Search Scout.{nl}Good luck.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000271	Have you ever offered worship to the Statue?{nl}If not, I'd really recommend it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000272	That depends on which goddess it is.{nl}If you follow the road to the right you will find the Statue of Goddess Zemyna. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000273	I do worry that the monsters might harm the Goddess Statue.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000274	I am happy that the statue is unharmed.{nl}The monsters here know to fear the goddess.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000275	Go down the Shadow Forest Road and you should arrive at Klaipeda shortly.{nl}Well then, may the blessings of the goddess be with you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000276	Please do me a favor if you are headed to Klaipeda.{nl}It's not easy to go back and forth from Klaipeda because of the Infrorocktors nowadays.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000277	Maybe taking care of the statues will make the goddesses return sooner...

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000281	Battle Commander
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000282	I will have my men notify the troops to assemble.{nl}You may return to Sir Titas to let him know.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000283	The errand shouldn't be anything too difficult.{nl}If you don't want to help, I'll send you off to Klaipeda right away.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000284	Search Scout
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000285	It sure is a problem.{nl}I didn't know Kepas could grow that big.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000286	Shouldn't a Revelator be heading to Klaipeda instead of hanging around here?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000287	I feel so relieved to be stationed in the Western Woods.{nl}There are some places where you'd rather die than be stationed.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000288	When you see a Goddess Statue, try offering your worship.{nl}Surely something nice will happen.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000289	This is a dangerous area. What are you doing here?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000290	Thank you.{nl}I better go report the roaming Large Kepa to Sir Titas.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000291	Weird... That is not a type of monster you'd face in a place like this.{nl}It must be hard to travel around.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000292	Assemble already?{nl}That's tough. There's still a pile of missions.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000293	First, defeat the Hanamings around here.{nl}Then, collect their petals.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000294	Even if this wasn't about the Revelators, but the goddesses returning instead,{nl}I wouldn't abandon my mission before it was over.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000295	Yes. This will be enough.{nl}Here is a pill that will restore your stamina instantly. I have enough of it so I will give you this {nl}as a gift.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000296	Stamina is consumed when you move.{nl}You can recover stamina by destroying a Tree Root Crystal or by resting.{nl}But you might not have time for that when you are being chased by monsters.{nl}That's when this pill comes in handy.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000297	I heard news from my men and was becoming worried.{nl}All is well if it ended up good.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000298	Klaipeda Resident
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000299	{nl}When do you think the goddess is coming back?{nl}Even if I ask the Revelators, all they say is that they must go to Klaipeda...

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000301	Trooper
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000302	I wonder what the goddesses are doing...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000303	Thank you for making your way here.{nl}I am Uska, the Knight Commander in charge of Siauliai and Klaipeda.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000304	The Bishop also dreamed of a revelation.{nl}He told me to send the Revelators to the Crystal Mine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000305	Let me know when you are ready to go to the Crystal Mine.{nl}I'll tell you the location and how to get in.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000306	The bishop told us to send the Revelators to the Crystal Mine.{nl}He said the goddess told him to do so.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000307	But the Miners' Village is at war with the Vubbes and its entrance is limited to authorized {nl}personnels only. Knight Aras is the one managing troops in the East Siauliai Woods. {nl}You should talk to him.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000308	Monsters have been around for a long time, {nl}but they only started becoming violent four years ago. {nl}The ones that were most affected would be the plant types. They did not exist before.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000309	Of course, beasts were no exception.{nl}I thought the end was near when monsters that seem to have fused with demons appeared.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000311	Aren't you hurt?{nl}I appreciate that you got rid of the Poata, because it was really reckless.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000313	And our troops are in no condition to guard you.{nl}I'm sorry but you will have to go back.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000314	If you can't defeat the Pokubus, you'll have to give up going into the Miners' Village.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000317	Although I'm worried about the situation in the Miners' Village, I'm not getting used to the {nl}constant fighting and resting. If only the Chupacabras could be dealt with to some degree, {nl}we would be much more well off.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000318	Other monsters are also flooding into areas where Chupacabras live.{nl}Miners' Village is a problem on its own but there are just too many things to pay attention to.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000319	Thank you.{nl}Your assistance really helps lift our spirits.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000320	With your abilities, I have one more favor to ask.{nl}Can you help us drive out the Chupacabras in the supply camp too?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000321	I'm worried for the Miners' Village, but the situation here isn't so good either. {nl}It'd be great if we could prepare some countermeasures before the number of monsters {nl}grow even further...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000322	You're done already?{nl}I've never seen anyone as fast as you before.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000324	There are other knights out in Miners' Village. {nl}Frankly, the battle here is taking longer than we thought, as we imagined the battle would {nl}end as soon as Aras was here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000325	Since you're going to help, please defeat the Giant Gray Chupacabras too.{nl}They are the culprits stealing our supplies.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000326	Giant Gray Chupacabras should appear now that you have defeated the Chupacabras.{nl}Well then, thanks for assisting.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000327	Thank you.{nl}Now I can finally get to work easily.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000328	Finding the cause of the monsters is important,{nl}but I'm more worried about supplies not making it to the Miners' Village.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000329	The movement of Weavers in the lower areas of the stream seems suspicious.{nl}Seems like they're trying to interfere with supplies to the Miners' Village.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000330	We might have to give up our current supplies and support ourselves until the next batch of {nl}supplies arrive.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000331	Thank you.{nl}With you helping us out like this, we will not be defeated.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000332	Your next mission is to find the cause of the increasing number of monsters.{nl}Popolions have a big appetite, so I hope we can find a clue.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000333	Although the Miners' Village is in trouble, given that the situation has reached the Eastern Woods,{nl}we can't assure the safety of Klaipeda.{nl}We hope the Miners' Village is putting up a good fight.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000334	Operations Officer
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000335	Were you sent by Aras?{nl}This is a piece of Vubbe clothing. Ah... I see...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000336	I think the Vubbes from the Miners' Village have made their way into the woods.{nl}Maybe that's also a reason behind the abnormal surge in monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000337	I better ask Aras to search for Vubbes in other regions too.{nl}In the meantime, I would like you to take a look at the upper areas.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000338	We haven't searched the upper areas yet.{nl}Of course we should be sending troops, but I ask for your help as this is an urgent matter.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000339	You saw a Vubbe Fighter but missed it?{nl}We also got a report of Vubbe Fighter appearing in the Southern area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000340	First, talk to the Search Scout by the bridge in the lower area of Bulves Farm.{nl}This will become a tedious, drawn out campaign if we let that Vubbe Fighter run loose.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000341	So the Vubbe Fighters are the reason behind the growing number of monsters.{nl}Please find out how many Vubbe Fighters there are.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000342	Under the circumstances, it makes sense that the monsters are controlled by the Vubbe Fighters.{nl}But deep down, you just don't want to believe it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000343	Following your report, there are no more Vubbe Fighters in these woods.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000344	It appears the Vubbe Fighters have been defeated. {nl}I alerted the Search Scout at the Nudeges Felled Area.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000345	Supply Soldier
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000346	We need Weaver Claws as a part of the supplies to be sent to Miners' Village, {nl}but we just don't have time to look for them. What do we do?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000347	Actually, it doesn't make sense for the Supply Soldier to directly retrieve the supplies.{nl}It should have come straight from Klaipeda.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000348	Thank you.{nl}Unexpected help always feels good.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000349	As a matter of fact, everything would also be better if the Pokubus weren't around.{nl}We couldn't retrieve all the supplies with them running amok.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000350	I don't know why they suddenly started to prey on the supplies.{nl}Could something be commanding them?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000351	Thank you.{nl}I envy your ability.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000352	Eastern Woods Search Scout
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000353	Oh, it's you.{nl}I have heard from the Operations Officer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000354	A Vubbe Fighter is hiding deep in the Nudeges Felled Area.{nl}We received orders to kill it, but it may be safer to wait for additional troops.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000355	I'm just a Search Scout, but this was my first time seeing a Vubbe Fighter up close.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000356	Amazing, you got rid of it by yourself?{nl}Report this to Aras, he'll be very pleased to hear this.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000357	You really defeated the Vubbe Fighter alone!{nl}What a relief, now the monsters will stop growing in numbers.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000358	Of course. As promised, I will grant you access to the Miners' Village.{nl}Please wait.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000359	If you find any clues, let the Operations Officer in the northern area know about it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000360	The Miners' Village is in a dire situation.{nl}It'll take too long to organize the troops so please go ahead and support the Miners' Village.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000361	They have low intelligence, but these monsters build groups and live as a community.{nl}They used to appear only occasionally in the deeper areas of the mines...{nl}Could they be expanding their forces?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000362	Whatever the reason is, the Vubbes expanding their territory is a big problem.{nl}Monsters that lose their territory to the Vubbes will be forced to make their way into our base.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000363	It's a single road from here on so you'll be able to find the people easily.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000364	Oh, let me give you some helpful information in return for your help.{nl}The evidence of salvation that the Revelators are looking for can be found in the Closed Area.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000365	One thing, there's something that keeps bothering me.{nl}A vague feeling of something alien.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000366	Miner
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000367	Thank you for saving us.{nl}It's like a dream to be saved by the Revelator.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000368	The Closed Area?{nl}If you absolutely need to get in there, gather the mysterious stones that the Vubbes carry.{nl}The Crystal Wall should open when you insert enough stones to it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000369	I was collecting supplies to be sent to the Miners' Village, but the monsters stole them all.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000370	The supply boxes contain dangerous explosives so collecting them will not be an easy task.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000371	They couldn't have gone far.{nl}It would have been better if it just exploded on the way.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000372	Mercenary Lindt
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000373	Thank you again.{nl}I should return to my commander soon. I think I can return to him after I get some more rest.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000374	I knew you would.{nl}One more thing, the ground near the Closed Area is weak so the entrance has been blocked {nl}for a long time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000375	The kidnapped people are veteran miners so they may know how to get in.{nl}Well then, may the blessings of the goddess be with you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000376	It wasn't long ago that I felt a strange power while performing experiments in the Closed Area.{nl}It was different from the mana that we know but it was very warm.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000377	But some force did not allow me to approach, as if it had an owner already.{nl}A few days after the incident, the bishop dreamed about the evidence of salvation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000378	Perhaps the evidence of salvation is the force I felt...{nl}That's what I think.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000379	All I see are monsters and we're out of supplies.{nl}I'm also curious how the battle situation is in Miners' Village.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000380	Until I'm assigned a new task, I'm thinking of going back to my duties as a search scout.{nl}Observing the monsters, you know.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000381	The Miners' Village is under siege and entrance is prohibited for civilians.{nl}Remember that we can't guarantee your safety if you do not get my permission.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000382	You have to cheer up.{nl} Even Aras is holding on.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000383	Goddess Zemyna overlooks the earth.{nl}There are rumors that the goddesses have abandoned us, but that's nonsense.{nl}The statues still shine beautifully when you pray to them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000384	Vubbes suddenly came pouring in into the Siauliai Woods from the Crystal Mines.{nl}Thus, the Miners' Village situated between the Mines and the Woods became a battlefield.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000385	For safety reasons, I can't permit entrance to the Miners' Village. {nl}Of course it would be a different story if your skill are good enough to ensure your own safety {nl}without the guards' protection.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000386	Gosh, that could have been really dangerous.{nl}That huge thing was hiding so well.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000387	It's very important to study the monsters at times like this.{nl}It's like weather forecasts where you try to understand the source to see what trends will happen.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000388	I am certain that the Leaf Bugs at Uolos Farm stole them.{nl}They have stolen from us before.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000389	Send my regards to the Guard Captain when you meet him.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000390	In order to test if your skills are good enough to enter the Miners' Village,{nl}I need you to help us solve a problem we have.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000391	First, take back Bulves Farm from the Pokubus.{nl}This should be a fairly easy task.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000392	(There seems to be a gap in the rock where you can insert something.)
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000393	Let's search Bulves Farm first.{nl}But don't chase them or something as it can be dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000394	You're making me wonder if you're an envoy of the goddess.{nl}Anyway, the supply camp is located further below the farm.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000395	The Leaf Veil Plateau you are looking for is further in from the Silverstream Gorge.{nl}You can get to Silverstream Gorge by going down from the middle of Twin Bridge.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000396	The Crystal Mine has become infested with Vubbes, so be sure to stay together in groups of five.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000397	Equipment Merchant
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000398	Even at times like this, I struggle to find the best items I can. You can't go easy when dealing{nl}with your customers.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000399	Monsters probably know I can tell which items are good as they attack and steal from people {nl}who buy items from me. I feel sorry for those who were attacked but it also proves that the {nl}items are worth it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000400	The monsters never raided Klaipeda, but with Sir Uska gone, it's hard to be at ease.{nl}You have you watch out for yourself at times like this.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000401	I want to travel with a single weapon in hand like an adventurer... Yeah there's no way I could.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000402	If you listen to the soldiers, they'll use terms only they can understand to make things sound {nl}complicated. But when I ask my soldier friend, he says it's not like they are talking about anything {nl}important.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000403	Be cautious of people who sell weapons from monsters without a permit.{nl}They'll try and scam you into to buying useless things or sell you things at ridiculously high prices.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000404	Item Merchant
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000405	It's the little things you forget to buy that makes you regret when you travel.{nl}Better buy enough of them when you can.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000406	I feel sorry for the injured. Can't we just get along with the monsters?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000407	I'd rather stay safe and at peace with lower sales than have sales shoot up because people are{nl}worried that the monsters might attack.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000408	I sell things that people need, but I sometimes think it would've been better if I was a healer,{nl}because that way I could be closer to the explorers to help them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000409	I hear strange howlings from the distance. Could they be monster sounds?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000410	People say I'm weird and I talk too much, but I don't mind. Even if I'm as weird like they say, {nl}that doesn't mean the items I sell are weird.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000411	Blacksmith
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000412	Hello.{nl}I can help you repair items but I can't craft new ones because I don't have the materials.{nl}Go on and choose from whatever is available.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000414	It's true these are tough times, but everyone is looking out for the soldiers.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000416	Why did the goddesses disappeared?{nl}Everyone is looking for where they've gone, but no one is asking why they disappeared.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000417	I can't eat, sleep, or move about freely because of those monsters.{nl}In the old days, we used gather herbs or pick fruits in the Siauliai Woods you know.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000418	Everyone is talking about the war wherever you go.{nl}Like who and how much people are hurt or who's assigned to where.{nl}All the stories about the war makes me sick!
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000419	I heard they will send soldiers who aren't even trained into the nest of monsters.{nl}Might as well gather the old people and make them soldiers too.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000420	My life is just a cycle of anxiety and anger.{nl}The goddess should return soon.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000421	There are suddenly many people who have had a revelation in their dreams.{nl}Could it be a sign that something is about to happen again?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000422	The bishop of Klaipeda saw a goddess in his dream.{nl}Did you also have such a dream, Revelator?

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000428	)}Maybe Klaipeda is where the goddess has bestowed her blessings.{nl}I hope the blessings will also reach my son in the army.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000429	)}My husband used to be a miner. I am relieved that he isn't anymore.{nl}It would be too dangerous if the monsters raid at times like this, wouldn't it?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000430	)}Many refugees came from fallen towns.{nl}Our food supplies are running short but we still have to help each other.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000431	I may not bring in the best of items, but shouldn't providing essentials be a skill of its own?{nl}I will work hard to get through these tough times.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000432	I think the best weapons and armor are the ones that you get used to over a long period time.{nl}In order to do so, you must first start by buying good items.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000433	I used to pack my things and go around traveling in the past but I guess that would be {nl}problematic now...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000434	Try using a variety of weapons. Eventually, you'll find one that fits you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000435	The armor that suits you will guarantee your safety.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000440	Sometimes the things you are looking at without any thoughts may actually fit you very well, {nl}so take a look and think about it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000441	You can just look around. Find me anytime you need something.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000455	Some monsters will mistaken things for food and swallow them. They must be really hungry.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000456	I once encountered a monster in Siauliai Woods. I just stood still and the monster went away...{nl}I guess there are monsters that do not make the first attack on people.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000457	I've heard that some people sell things that are dropped from those who were running away {nl}from the monsters. I don't sell stuff like that, so don't worry about that.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000464	I don't think of making a lot of money. I just need enough to live by.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000473	Sometimes when I see the soldiers who protect us from the monsters, I want to give them things {nl}for free. Although it's really not easy for me to do so...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000474	Better were the days when Commander Uska took care of Klaipeda himself.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000796	I would never have thought that you would defeat them this quickly.{nl}Thank you for your help.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000797	Follower Donatas
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000798	Thank you. {nl}This is sufficient to make a transformation scroll.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000799	You can transform into a demon by using this scroll. {nl}Persuade the demons to go to the altar on their own.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000800	I get caught every time, maybe the demons know my scent. {nl}I'm sure it'll be easier for you since you haven't been around for long.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000801	Alright. {nl}I think that should be enough for you to grasp their nature.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000802	The power of the altar makes conversion simple. {nl}First, you activate the power of Globejas Altar. {nl}Then, stay within the influence of the altar and fight the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000803	The demons have stronger minds than you might think. {nl}It will take a lot of effort to make them forget about Gesti.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000804	Don't trust the water's effects too much, or Glizardon may find out about it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000805	I am thinking about an effective way to defeat the demons.{nl}You came just at the right time.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000806	When you place the Holy Stone, it will absorb the lives of the nearby demons automatically.{nl}Defeat the demons that have already had their life absorbed.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000807	You can obtain Vicious Essences from the demons.{nl}You can purify these essences at the Altar of Purification, which is down from here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000808	Oh, they will find out if you are not confident enough. {nl}So it's better to fight the demons to gain some self confidence before using the scroll.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000809	Epigraphist Raymond
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000810	This isn't the only monument.{nl}There's a fine monument at Irody Square.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000811	I wonder who mourned that traitor? Don't you think there would be a different reason?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000812	Surprisingly, this looks fine.{nl}We should get ready to restore it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000813	His monument is cased with a terrible magic because he was a traitor.{nl}We should use that magic instead.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000814	If we received support, then we would have hired mercenaries.{nl}Studying about the traitor doesn't mean that we praise the traitor, so I don't understand why{nl}we lost support.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000815	Thanks.{nl}Achat must have been drawn to the magic power cast upon the monument.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000816	It's kind of curious that something that looks like a tree stump would be interested in {nl}stone plates.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000817	I am sorry, but we can't find the one that we needed among the fragments you brought.{nl}I hope it has not already been eaten.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000818	If we burn the Tree Ambulo, do you think we can find the stone pieces that they swallowed?{nl}I stacked four piles of firewood over there, light them up and push the Tree Ambulo in {nl}when the wood is burning.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000819	Be careful though.{nl}It will be dangerous if a flaming Tree Ambulo runs into the camp.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000820	Treasure Hunter Eden
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000821	I am a treasure hunter, not a monster hunter.{nl}I don't want this place to become my grave, having fought monsters.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000822	I've collected all the fragments Raymond requested. {nl}Bring them back to Raymond.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000823	Eden told you to give this to me?{nl}Hmm. It will take some time to restore it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000824	Can you take these restored gravestone fragments to my assistant at Irody Square?{nl}I think something good will happen when we finish restoring it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000825	Epigraphist Schmid
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000826	This... Our master did it!{nl}Give it to me, please.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000829	Please put the sacrifices in the jar at Dumbliu Pond.{nl}The summoned spirit will come to me if you succeed.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000830	It depends on how one uses necromancy.{nl}It could be good or bad depending on what Necromancer has in his mind.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000831	The experiment failed? I am so sorry.{nl}I should research more here to find out what went wrong.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000832	Monument of Lydia Schaffen
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000833	My name is Lydia Schaffen.{nl}For the reasons that I have endured this deep burden of sadness, I am now going to tell the truth {nl}about Ruklys on this land.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000835	I didn't know she studied with Ruklys, the traitor.{nl}Shoot. I've almost used up all the charcoal.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000836	Eventually, Ruklys failed.{nl}He was destroyed by those who were jealous of him.{nl}He left to the goddess by my hands.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000837	What was Lydia Schaffen's relationship with Ruklys?{nl}I am not astute enough to understand.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000839	The stage that Ruklys had reached was astonishing.{nl}But, his noble mission was too difficult to be accomplished on this land.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000840	Since I am on a long journey, my luggage is not heavy.{nl}It's better to buy anything from local shops.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000841	Any archer would want to have good arrowheads.{nl}I will show you how to find good arrowheads, so how about you help me some?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000842	They aren't very quick, so this shouldn't be hard for you to do.{nl}I'm sure of it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000843	Thanks. These are still hot to the touch.{nl}Aren't they nice?

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000854	If you have trouble pulling it over to the burning wood, then just kick it in hard.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000855	I need the flame of Infroburk at the Shiluma Altar Site.{nl}Get close to the back of that monster and heat these arrowheads.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000856	I was trying to get something for myself while I had this signed contract with Raymond.{nl}But, now I have nothing besides stone fragments.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000857	It'll be clear to you what's on Ruklys' memorial after you've restored it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000858	Great. {nl}Please leave activating the altar to me and go meet Vaidas at Himnas Chapel.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000860	Good. This will be enough.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000861	It feels so good to see them flying.{nl}But, they are too noisy so I need to study more.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000862	I have never seen a stone filled with this much holiness.{nl}Thank you very much for giving it so much effort.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000863	The demons' attacks are stronger than we expected.{nl}If we are able to defeat Glizardon, then it will be easier to defeat them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000864	Follower Vaidutis
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000865	I came to say that Gesti went up to the 2nd floor, and I let my guard down. {nl}I would have been in big trouble if not for you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000866	I studied the barrier at the gate, but the power of the basement altar is insufficient. {nl}Could you supply me with Power Crystals from the Corylus?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000867	Maybe the goddess knew it'd fail and that's why she said to wait for the Revelator. {nl}At least we hurt Gesti some, so that's good.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000868	Well done. {nl} Making the Light Crystal with this will be enough power to break the barrier.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000869	Prepare yourself before bringing the Light Crystal to the gate. {nl}It can attract powerful monsters.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000870	I think I'll stay here to stop the demons from entering the basement.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000871	It is an honor to fight with you, Revelator. {nl} Could you drive the demons from this area while Follower Algis investigates?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000872	If you don't mind, can you get Eyes of Madness from Rodelins?{nl}They are handy when you want to hide yourself from demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000873	I don't want those filthy things to be near me either.{nl}But, it's worse to face against those demons alone.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000874	Thanks.{nl}I will share them with the other brothers before the demons find out.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000875	You are indeed the Revelator.{nl}Now, we can concentrate on protecting the altar.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000876	Don't worry, the barrier at the main entrance to the 1st floor can be offset by the church's {nl}power. That's what the altars are for. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000877	Let's take care of the Unknocker first. {nl}I'll lure the Unknocker, giving you a chance to attack it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000878	I want to request to you to defeat Pawndel and Pawnd.{nl}They are demon sisters and they give us headaches.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000879	Be careful, I almost got attacked as well.{nl}They are really violent.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000880	Good job. {nl}Their babbling laughter seems to have stopped.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000881	I am thinking of creating confusion by charading as a demon.{nl}Could you gather some cloth from Pawndel and Pawnd after defeating them?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000882	It's a bit blasphemous, but we don't have much choice.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000883	Well done. {nl}It will probably be difficult for them to trust each other from now on. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000884	I'm thinking of converting the demons using the power of the altar. {nl}The converted demons will absorb the divine power and slowly start to die. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000885	But before that, it's important for us to understand the demons. {nl}Collect some demon souls for me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000886	I remember the first time I converted the demons. {nl}I pray for their poor souls.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000887	Good job. {nl}If there are any good demons left, the goddess will look after them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000888	The Central Altar that suppresses the power of the demons suddenly stopped. {nl}Could you take a look at what's going on?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000889	Strange, it was definitely working.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000890	It was an ambush. {nl}We would have been in big trouble without your help.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000891	You need the Seal of Space in order to enter the hidden sanctuary. {nl}It's hidden in the Sventove Central Altar, but I just hope it's not too late.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000892	Many structures in the Tenet Church are placed to ward against the demons. {nl}Each one in itself is a small barrier that contributes to a huge barrier. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000893	The most powerful barrier is on the 2nd floor. {nl}I heard that it can exert the greatest force when the Divine Sphere is there.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000894	Gesti has made the first move. {nl}It will be difficult to approach her secretly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000895	We must change our plan. {nl}First, we'll need to go observe Gesti's actions. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000896	Let's start by retaking the Bell Tower.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000897	From here, we can see what Gesti is up to.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000898	Alright, bring back the Seal of Space from the Sventove Central Altar. {nl}Can you do this?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000899	You must realize that the revelation is hidden in the sanctuary. {nl}The Seal of Space is the single key that will get you to the sanctuary. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000900	Not only can the Seal of Space get you to the sanctuary within the Tenet Church, {nl}it'll allow you to enter any location where the goddess have hid before.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000901	The Seal of Space can only be used by the Revelator, so she won't be able to find the revelation {nl}right away. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000902	But the enemy is the Demon Queen herself. Even the Paladin Master couldn't defeat her.{nl}We have to use the powers of the destroyed altar.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000903	We can't do anything about the destroyed altar, but the fragments still have power. {nl}Gather the pieces and insert them into the 8 pillars of the Sventove Central Hall.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000904	When you are done, I will be able to restrict Gesti through the power of the Divine Sphere and {nl}the church. It may be for a short while but that's the best option we have.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000905	So you activated the Malda Altar? {nl}Now it will be safe to stay here for the time being. Good work.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000906	Demons are going around the second floor searching every corner. {nl}Activating the Auka Altar will divert their attention.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000907	I'm relieved you're beside me. {nl}I think it was a good thing that Laima chose you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000908	Thank you for your hardwork. {nl}When this is over, I plan to gather all brothers and drive them away at once.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000909	I'll ring a bell to let you know when Gesti gets close to you, so please listen for it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000910	So you found the Seal of Space. {nl}Use the crest on the pillar beside me to go to the sanctuary. {nl}It is prepared for the Revelator only.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000911	May the blessings of the goddess be with you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000912	So Gesti just ran away. {nl}Fine. Since you got the revelation, we've completed the mission. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000913	So you are in search of Goddess Saule...{nl}The Iridescent Valley spoken of in the revelation {nl}should begin at Grassy Brookside located north of here.{nl}I bid thee farewell. I shall pray for the goddesses' blessings to be upon your path.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000914	When you find the revelation, tell the Paladin Master of the story you've been through so far. {nl}May the blessings of the goddess be with you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000915	Seems like Gesti has not notice yet. {nl}We better prepare the Divine Sphere.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000916	All preparations have been made. {nl} The barriers of the church will soon weaken Gesti. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000917	Gesti will be enough for you to handle once she's weakened. {nl}When Gesti is cornered, I will make the final strike with the Divine Sphere.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000918	These are pieces of the barrier at Mazas Rest Place. {nl}Do not worry. There are ways to recover the barrier, so I'm sure it will be alright.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000919	I didn't know the demons would use summoning circles to come through. {nl} I suggest removing them all before they siege us.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000920	Even with this many demons, you still managed to make it through. {nl}You may be the Revelator, but that's still impressive. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000921	It's the revelation. {nl}Cherish it and do not show it to anyone else. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000922	Come on. Go to the Paladin Master. {nl}He will tell you the way you must go.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000923	I asked my precious friend Algis to go to the Tenet Church. {nl}I won't lose to Gesti, but it is important to have some back up plan just in case.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000924	This Divine Sphere was the weapon used against Gesti at Emerald Bluff.{nl}It has been passed down since the first Paladin.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000925	In the kingdom, there are several valuable weapons aside from this Divine Sphere. {nl}Those weapons saved many lives on Medzio Diena four years ago.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000926	Starting from now, I will focus on the Divine Sphere.{nl}In the meantime, please use your skills so that nothing can disturb me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000927	Sorry. My abilities weren't good enough. {nl}Gesti has now realized that the Holy Relic is not the revelation, and is probably heading {nl}straight to the church. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000928	But this old body of mine does not follow my will anymore. {nl}Now I can only trust my old friend Algis and you. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000929	Go. The Tenet Church is at the Fallen Tree Garden.{nl}Stop Gesti from gaining the revelation at all costs.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000930	It is too much for me to handle alone without any help from the other brothers. {nl}I'd better use the Malda Altar. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000931	Nearby demons will be branded when the Malda Altar is activated.{nl}Defeat the demons once they are branded.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000932	We still have a lot to do here.{nl}The goddess told us to never give up.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000933	The world still needs more experience. {nl}We probably wouldn't have made it this far without the help of the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000934	Activating the Tree Guard Post Barrier is taking longer than I thought. {nl}We have no time, let's charge it with demon souls instead.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000935	All souls are pure. So even if it's a demon's soul, it can still provide some divine power.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000936	So the Tree Guard Post Barrier has been charged with demon souls, huh. {nl}It still needs some final touches for completion, but I'll take care of it from here. {nl}Great job.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000937	It's amazing you can use the barrier like that. {nl}Even the Paladins did not know about that. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000938	I am exhausted. I'd like to rest a little.{nl}Would you take care of the demons nearby to give me some time to recover?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000939	Holding off against this many enemies is by itself a great feat. {nl}It's all thanks to the Paladin Master.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000940	Even though he's still young, Kenneth is amazing. {nl}I think we can trust him a little more.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000941	I have received an urgent message from the Watchers.{nl}A gigantic demon monster is coming this way.{nl}Quickly, follow me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000942	Biteregina, which used to live in the deep forest, has appeared here.{nl}It even built a hive at the upper side of Rojus Plateau. Since it's dangerous, can you defeat it?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000943	Thank you so much!{nl}How did it come from such a far forest?{nl}Strange, huh?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000944	I can't do anything since the Seedmias are attacking us from every direction.{nl}Can you defeat them?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000945	I really hope those Seedmias don't hit me on the head with those flower buds. {nl}They look horrible.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000946	I received a mysterious charm from the elders that will brainwash Pantos to stand on our side.{nl}Are you up for a challenge?{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_001003	Ah, the stabilization has come to an end.{nl}I am okay. It's nothing. Just old memory coming back.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_001004	The Jewel of Prominence has stopped going crazy.{nl}But, in order to fully stabilize it, we need the Essence of Flame from the fireplace at the middle of the tower.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006970	Thank you. It's a long story.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006971	It's too selfish to seek salvation now.{nl}I'm exhausted. It may actually be better to be eliminated with Archon altogether.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006972	Salvation... I may still have a sliver of hope for it.{nl}I will count on you. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006973	You must find a way to stop the magic flowing into the Magic Stone of {nl}Sympathy. If we could find the documents that Valius left at Veikini Prayer Room, {nl}it may not be a meaningless dream...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006974	Salvation. I have forgotten that word. I had longing hope for it.{nl}Despair was all I could do for such a long time...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006975	Okay. Was the document present?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006976	The Magic Generating Stones.{nl}They are at the Room of Consciousness and the Room of Ancestral Rituals.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006977	I know the basic composition. I've researched it when I was alive.{nl}But it won't react without Valius' magic.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006978	You can find Valius' keepsakes in Vebaiki Burial Chamber.{nl}There should still be magical power within it since Valius was a great wizard.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006979	I am sure there is magical power left.{nl}I have nothing else but to hope it still exists.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006980	I'm relieved that there is still magical power remaining.{nl}First, let's stop the magic generating stone near the Room of Consciousness.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006981	I hid the magic generating stones amongst fakes in the Room of Consciousness.{nl}But, with the brooch you found, you should be able to distinguish the real ones from the fakes.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006982	Keep this in mind. Pick out the real magic generating stones and stop the magical power.{nl}If you touch on the fakes, all magic generating stones will be activated again.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006983	It has been hundreds of years since I felt earnesty.{nl}I pray to the goddesses that this isn't just a delusionary dream.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006984	The magical power that came from the Room of Consciousness has completely disappeared.{nl}Now, we just have to block the Room of Ancestral Rituals.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006985	The Room of Ancestral Rituals is somewhat different from the Room of Consciousness.{nl}Nonetheless, you must shut down the magical power of all magic generating stones {nl}in both rooms{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006986	You will know how to handle it when you control it yourself.{nl}But if you feel something went wrong, use Valius' magic.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006987	With the warp magic circle under me, you could quickly go to the Room of Ancestral Rituals.{nl}I wish for your success...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006988	The magic generating stones in the Room of Ancestral Rituals affect the other magic generating {nl}stones nearby. We could start over with Valius' magic.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006989	The magical power supplied to the Magic Stone of Mutuality has been completely {nl}shut off... Is it alright to wish for the salvation now?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006990	We are all ready. But that Archon is different from the Archon from your era. {nl}It may be better to leave it as is.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006991	There's is another way. The sealed keepsakes amongst Valius' collection of keepsakes...{nl}I heard some of them were created in Uzdaromo Stone Chamber to suppress the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006992	I had already given up the hope that I would become free a few hundreds years ago.{nl}Even now, I have little hope for it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006993	The seal that is suppressing the demonic energy... that's it.{nl}Now everything is ready.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006994	Now when the Magic Stone of Mutuality stops, I will be free from Archon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006995	I will tell you one more time. Don't consider this Archon as similar to the one in your era.{nl}It will be hard fight without using the seal.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006996	Honestly, I'll be fine even if I disappear like this.{nl}I'm very grateful that you cared for me, but I don't want you to get hurt.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006997	I can see the glimpse of freedom from the shackles that was on me for hundreds of years.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006998	I can be saved. I... finally...{nl}I can't thank you enough.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006999	I will now leave to the goddesses.{nl}Thank you. Thank you so much...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007000	How did it go?{nl}We can alleviate the strange energy in this region if we strengthen the magic circle.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007001	If I only had little more time...{nl}My documents... I can't leave them...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007002	The objects are useless to me now...{nl}Okay. Maybe you... My documents at Dykyne Fork...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007003	I don't have regrets anymore... but, be careful about that man.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007004	Let's see, while I am cleaning this...{nl}Sorry, but can you take care of the tablet at Gruitis Hall with the brush and rubbing tools I brought?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007005	Will be wandering when the string of the destiny disconnects...{nl}It must mean Goddess Laima... But there's a rumor that she appeared... It's complicated.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007006	When someone is born with a silver spoon in his mouth, life will be good for him.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007007	{nl}What, what the hell...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007008	It's too soon to give up now.{nl}When I went to Vseio Cliffs, I saw one more tablet.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007009	However, it seems that normal ink won't catch well on it due to the mosses.{nl}Craute Grass juice should solve that problem. But I forgot to bring some as I came back.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007010	Don't assume all forecasts by oracles are predictions of the future.{nl}Sometimes, they could help us determine what's right and wrong in our lives.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007011	Is it complex? Yes, but you will soon know.{nl}You will soon find clues about the very fabric that weaves together this interwined world.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007012	When you get enough Craute Grass Juice, use it to rub off the mosses on the tablet at Vseio Cliffs.{nl}It is famous for having a smell that lures monsters...but my assistant here is strong, right?.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007013	When you rub the grass juice on it, you should see the effects right away,{nl}but you should still let it sit for a while. The mosses will go away eventually.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007014	It wasn't effective? I guess the moss isn't normal moss.{nl}Hmm. Then I guess I should go ask Vaidotas. There must be some way.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007015	Alright then I'll be going now. {nl}Oh, can I ask you to get bone powder from the monsters here?{nl}I need something that helps ink adhere well.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007016	Fortunately, Vaidotas gave me something nice.{nl}He said to use this special ink with the bone-powder adhesive.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007017	Okay. I want you to get the last rubbing with this.{nl}My legs ache since I traveled so far...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007018	I have a good feeling about this one.{nl}Do you think we may be able to find a decent forecast this time?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007019	The world for the dead of the dead should also exist
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007020	{nl}Dead of the dead? This... This may be just the forecast I was looking for.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007021	I should do more research on this forecast. {nl}Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007022	While I am interpreting this, I will give you the rope with a magnet so please go to the well with that.{nl}I saw a Metal Plate on the floor. If that's the plate, it will come up after being attached.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007023	There's no strange reason.{nl}The people used to live here even before the empire was built here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007024	A small village becomes a big village and then a city...{nl}And then it will be forgotten.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007025	I told you a while ago, but if possible, I would have pulled it out.{nl}Please beware of the surroundings near you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007026	Difficult, difficult...{nl}The words are hard to understand.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007027	I guess it was the Metal Plate.{nl}It was lucky that the well was dried... If not, it could have been horrible.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007028	I will organize them and show you later.{nl}You are the Revelator. They will help your journey to find the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007029	It seems that the Metal Plates that you've brought can't be worked due to the rusts.{nl}Why did they record on the Metal Plate...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007030	In fact, I didn't know what this Metal Plate was.{nl}Since this place is the hometown of Demetrius, I came here expecting something may be present.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007031	Nothing was engraved on it, rather it was full of rusts.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007032	At then, my eyes were ignited with flame.{nl}Demetrius has something to tell you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007033	Yes. Now is not the time to just complain. First, I should make the rust remover.{nl}I want you to obtain the inner core of Hallowventor Magician.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007034	Defeat the rusts with the rust remover and maintain it with the anticorrosive agent. {nl}If it weren't you, I wouldn't have done it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007035	Fast indeed.{nl}Okay. I will make the acidic solution with this. It will become the basis of the rust remover.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007036	Secondly, when we sprinkle the rust powders, some monsters react.{nl}Collect some bubbling liquid from that monster. A lot of it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007037	Ah. If you sprinkle it too much, it may endure all the monsters nearby.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007038	I went to meet Alchemist in Mine Village because of Rust Remover and Acidic Solution.{nl}He was being so arrogant...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007039	Well done. {nl}This place is almost completed so go help Alruida near Apsva Hall.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007040	Ah, I forgot to tell you. {nl}She is my ally. She is probably looking for the Metal Plate at the great hall.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008186	Here, use the Seal of Space on the pillar beside me and go to the sanctuary. {nl}It is prepared only for the Revelator. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008187	I was there when the Divine Tree was destroying the capital. {nl}But I was not able to stop it. I was not able to save everyone.{nl}This will remain in my heart like a needle and it hurts me forever.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008198	I came back because the elders told me to restore the dolls used for spells.{nl}A doll for spells. Doesn't that sound exciting?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008199	I can't stand seeing the Panto totems pressed with evil energy. {nl} I'm going to break it through the shaman doll. Want to give it a try?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008200	I heard the first Paladin promised three things in return for saving our family. {nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008208	Prayers and ceremonies are not the only ways of serving the goddess. {nl}Serving the world through physical training is also an important mission of the cleric.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008210	The magic to control time is the essence of all magics.{nl}These are Agailla Flurry's words.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008211	I heard a Revelator defeated the Demon Lord ransacking the Royal Mausoleum.{nl}As a person undergoing training, I am ashamed that I couldn't go out and fight.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008212	The bishop is praying in closure. {nl}When you are ready, please go to Aras in the Eastern Woods.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008213	I'll give you more than what the knight asked me to give so please help us find the goddesses. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008214	Klaipeda is full of hope and expectations for the Revelators who dreamed of the goddess. {nl}I am also one of them. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008215	I'll give you more than what the knight asked me to give. {nl}Since we have many Revelators, things will get better, right? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008216	You mean you actually drove away the Demon Lord from the Crystal Mine... {nl}Thank you for restoring in me something that I had lost for a while. Hope. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008217	The first Paladin and the Tenet Church fulfilled their duties. {nl}Right.. The time has finally come. Together with the Revelator. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008218	I heard the monsters in Kateen Forest are eating up the Owl Sculptures I've made. {nl}I'm sure they are trying to use the souls for something else. Like for nourishment... 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008219	Did you know? A Revelator defeated the Demon Lord in the Crystal Mine. {nl}Do you think that with disaster also comes hope? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008220	When I first saw the Revelators, I wondered if they were worthy of that name. {nl}But they saved the Crystal Mine and the Tenet Church. {nl}There is definitely a Savior whom the goddess sent. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008221	I heard some Revelator defeated the Demon Lord in Crystal Mine. {nl}That's incredible. Aren't Demon Lords the greatest among the demons? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008222	Did you hear about the Revelator who stopped the Demon Queen at the Tenet Church? {nl}It would have been better if she was killed for good, {nl}but she is the Demon Queen after all, someone that even the Paladin Master wasn't able to defeat. {nl}That is awesome enough. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008223	As a Hunter, my instinct says the monsters in this forest are showing unusual movement. {nl}As if they are controlled by something. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008224	I feel ashamed that I wasn't able to join the squad in the Tenet Church. {nl}But isn't it amazing? the Tenet Church was saved from that Demon Lord. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008225	Just as I thought. The monsters in this forest were chased in by the Vubbes. {nl}And the Revelator actually defeated the Demon Lord that planned all this.{nl}I really wonder who it was. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008226	If it was my hometown, if a demon occupied the Mines, everyone would have attacked it and celebrated. {nl}Anyway, I don't know who that Revelator is but this weak kingdom finally found someone useful. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008227	A sacred church had to go through such bad things. The clerics of this kingdom are planning something unusual.{nl}But it's a good thing to have protected the Tenet Church. It means they have the guts, don't you think? {nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008228	The Vubbes suddenly rushed out of the Mines. {nl}I have no idea what's going on. Do you have anything that comes to mind? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008229	We won't know if the Revelators really dreamed of the goddess. It could even be a trick of the demons. {nl}But didn't someone among them save the Tenet Church. {nl}From the Demon Lord even. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008230	It's a relief a Revelator drove away the Demon Lord from the mines. I was scared another Medzio Diena would happen. {nl}But I felt something warm... Was it just my delusion? {nl}It was a pure and good energy.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008231	It's such good news that a Revelator helped drive away the Demon Lord of the Crystal Mine.{nl}But I felt a strange and sacred energy... Could it have been just a delusion? {nl}It is hard to describe it.  
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008232	Do you think Medzio Diena and the demons are related? {nl}I mean look at the Tenet Church. It was as if the demons were waiting for that moment...{nl}Come to think of it, the Revelators could have been ones who set the stage. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008233	I made it through the wild monsters and you made through the Thorn Forest. {nl}I'm sure you're not looking for the goddess... So what's the matter? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008234	I heard the historians were attacked by the Demon Lord at King's Plateau. {nl}So it means the disaster was forewarned a thousand years ago? {nl}Anyway, it's a relief the Revelator was able to stop it. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008235	In between this Gorge Area and Klaipeda is the Thorn Forest that is full of evil energy. {nl}It was just a normal and peaceful forest before but..{nl}You making it through the forest... Does it mean the forest is now purified? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008236	There is still so much left undiscovered about the Great King Zachariel.{nl}But since the demons live longer than us... This must have been what they were preying at. {nl}I don't know who it is but it's a good thing the Revelator stopped it. We might even have had another Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008237	I heard the source of the evil energy deep in the Thorn Forest recently disappeared. {nl}But we will need a long time for the forest to return to its previous state...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008238	Did you hear that a Revelator stopped the Demon Lord's plan in the Royal Mausoleum? {nl}I heard that a Demon Lord was going around destroying the ruins in King's Plateau.{nl}I'm glad it got its punishment.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008239	How did you come here? Did you make it through the Thorn Forest? {nl}Hmm. Are you saying you can't tell me about it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008240	The Demon Lord that was messing with King's Plateau seems to have been the reason behind all the cases of missing people. {nl}It serves him right that a Revelator stopped all his plans from succeeding. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008241	Since Goddess Saule disappeared, the area around Kvailas Forest was filled with evil energy and thorns. {nl}But you made it through the Thorn Forest? Can we say that's a good sign? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008242	A Revelator saved the Royal Mausoleum of King Zachariel. {nl}But why would the demons go after ruins that's over a thousand years old? {nl}There is so much that we don't know about. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008243	I heard the monsters keep attacking the ruins and the historians keep disappearing. {nl}Yet, nobody remembers anything after the fact. How funny. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008244	I heard a Revelator drove out the Demon Lord that was trying to take over the Royal Mausoleum. {nl}That's funny. Doesn't that mean that everything was foreseen a thousand years ago? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008245	If the Demon Lord invaded the Royal Mausoleum, then the symptoms of Jonas in Gate Route also becomes clear. {nl}If King Zachariel erased the memory of the workers in the Mausoleum, then it must be a side effect of the old magic. {nl}What do you think he was planning to do? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008246	Now the demons even bear the face of a human. {nl}I heard some Revelator stopped the Demon Lord in the Royal Mausoleum,{nl} but I wonder how many demons are now hiding amongst humans. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008247	This place holds records of the hidden side of history. {nl}Time is an absolute thing. It just depends on how you look at it. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008248	I heard a Revelator stopped the Demon Lord that was eyeing the Royal Mausoleum. {nl}It may be a bit overboard to make a connection between Medzio Diena and a king from a thousand years ago... {nl}But I'm sure that was something that we were all made to forget.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008249	The demons have been continuously attacking the Mage Tower even before Medzio Diena.{nl}Thanks to the goddess sending us the Revelator, we finally make an end to the long battle. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008250	The weight of history feels astoundingly heavy when you stand in this place. {nl}Maybe you can find a clue about Medzio Diena here. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008251	I keep thinking that Medzio Diena might have just been a process.{nl}If not, then why would the demons go after a mausoleum that is over a thousand years old? {nl}It's a good thing some Revelator stopped it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008252	Everyone knew that Helgasercle showed an obsession towards the Mage Tower since centuries ago. {nl}Whatever is in that tower, we can finally see the end of it. {nl}That's a great thing. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008253	First the Tenet Church and now the Great Cathedral...{nl}But they say it was all resolved by the Revelator, so I am hopeful that things will get better.{nl}Not minding the gossip of the world and doing what you must is what's good for the goddess and the kingdom. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008254	The rumor that a Revelator saved the Mage Tower is something that even someone like me, {nl}who is not interested in the gossips of the world, will take in. {nl}I'm surprised that there was a even one person who was good enough from anybody there. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008255	Hergasercle was an incarnation of obsession. {nl}The chain of obsession was broken thanks to the Revelator but its souls is not something that can be saved. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008256	I heard a Revelator defeated the Demon Lord who sullied the wise teachings of Maven. {nl}Now it is time for us priests to come forward. {nl}We should put away our regrets about failing to protect the Great Cathedral and atone for our sins. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008257	My colleague is dead?{nl}That can't be. Only if I had not tempted him...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008258	This map is useless to me now, without my colleague.{nl}Please pray that my colleague goes to the goddess safely.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008259	I can't leave everything behind...

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008381	{nl}Yes, yes, right. That is also why Giedra is trying to make the scripture using the monster shells. {nl}That's why we are always attacked like this. {nl}Because they can smell their fellows...

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008394	I belong to the Anastos. {nl}The Nestos still pursue unconditional belief even at this point when the goddesses are all gone. {nl}That's why they are building sanctuaries here and there.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008397	There is another sanctuary over there. {nl}I will finish burning this sanctuary so please destroy the one over there. {nl}We need to teach those Nestos as lesson.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008404	{nl}Albinas? He is one of Anastopas? That can't be. {nl}Bring that person here. I need to check for myself. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008405	Are you saying that Albinas guy is missing? {nl}It's getting out of hand. {nl}I'm sure Anastos won't do such a thing. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008406	{nl}Anyway, our priority then is to restore this sanctuary. {nl}You did this so you should be responsible for it. {nl}There are rocks over there. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008407	{nl}This sanctuary was also made of the rocks here so collect some rocks. {nl}And the Nestos Camp is over there. {nl}You'll find someone named Eduinas . {nl}Ask him to polish the rocks to use as materials for restoring the sanctuary. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008408	If he finds out you did this to the sanctuary, he won't polish the rocks easily. {nl}But that's a price you have to pay and you should be responsbile for it. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008409	Still not done yet? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008410	Eduinas
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008411	Who are you..? {nl}And what are these rocks? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008412	What? Destoryed the sanctuary? {nl}The sanctuary that was built with everyone's efforts here? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008413	I don't need your apologies. {nl}I'll polish the rocks to use as materials since Damijonas said so but don't ever do that again. {nl}And while I polish these, I don't want to see your face so go away and take care of some monsters nearby.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008414	You should wait longer. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008415	Done. Now, don't ever do that again.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008416	You brought it. {nl}Now let's begin the restoration. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008417	Done. It's a good thing it wasn't totally destroyed. {nl}I apologize for being angry at you a while ago. Seeing the sanctuary destroyed was upsetting. {nl}But it's not total nonsense. {nl}Anastos and Nestos may be in conflict of interests but we do not invade each other's territory. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008418	{nl}But you mentioned someone from Anastos that I don't even know as the reason behind destroying the sanctuary so I couldn't hold my anger. {nl}Anyway, at least you restored it...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008419	{nl}But it strange. I have never heard of that name...{nl}Anastos Camp is in the northern side so why don't you go there and ask. {nl}It really is strange. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008420	Gedas
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008421	Don't bother me if you don't have any business. {nl}Ah... I really need that...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008422	{nl}Hey, can you find it for me? {nl}My research materials. {nl}The monsters took them all from me...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008423	More than other things, we need to find it first! {nl}My research! My research! {nl}The monsters took it! {nl}Find me that first!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008424	Are you not done yet? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008425	Let me see... {nl}Yes, right! You got them all! {nl}Thank you very much!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008426	{nl}Oh, did you have something to ask? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008427	Albi...nas...?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008428	{nl}Uh...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008429	{nl}Nope. I can't think of anyone on Anastos with that name. {nl}Moreover, he told you go burn and destroy the Nestos sanctuary? {nl}Oh my god...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008430	{nl}Nonsense. We don't do such a thing. {nl}I think we need to investigate on that matter. {nl}We give danger signal fires when we send out people for investigation {nl}and we ran out of it just now. {nl}Can you find some firepowder that are used to make the danger signal fires? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008431	We all serve the goddess. That is why we're on the pilgrimages. {nl}It's just a small difference in how we see the world. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008432	{nl}Nestospa's people say that we should believe in the goddesses unconditionally even if they disappeared, {nl}while we, the Anastospa, pursue something more practical. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008433	{nl}Defeating demons, improving the qualities of human lives... we have to aim for those things.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008434	Monsters are all around so it will be difficult to obtain the materials.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008435	But, Albinas... We don't feel good about it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008436	Okay, good. That's enough.{nl}Now, we will make flame bombs. Please wait a bit.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008437	We've completed the flame bomb... Now I will call my colleague.{nl}He is called Fabijus.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008438	Fabijus is a moderatist among Anastos, so he won't have problem even if he meets one of Nestos on his way.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008439	Since Fabijus left... we would somehow get some answer.{nl}But, I don't feel good about it. Is there any information...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008440	{nl}Ah! Barte over ther must know something.{nl}He arrived here while traveling various locations.{nl}How about we ask about Albinas there?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008441	It's just a different perspective of looking at the world. {nl}The topic they cover the most...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008442	{nl}The disappearances of the goddesses were done spontaneously so are we going to still follow then after they abandoned us...{nl}Another problem is whether we, humans should continue to manage the world where the goddesses have disappeared...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008443	{nl}Are we going to aim for the truth or trust the goddessses and pray... that will be the difference.{nl}But, they are just conflicting each other and they don't deny each others' existences.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008444	She is rather progressive.{nl}So since she is not close to me... I want you to go to her.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008445	Barte
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008446	{nl}Ah, yes. I am called Barte.{nl}I was on a journey until recently. I am thinking about leaving again.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008447	Albinas... Is that him?{nl}When we arrived at the camp recently, one man was wearing the same outfit like us so I was going to say hello, but then I felt something was not right so I decided not to.{nl}He was giggling as he was looking at the leathers that were engraved with writings and he ripped off those leathers.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008448	{nl}I was scared since that wasn't the power of a human, but he threw all those leathers on the ground and disappeared down there. The monsters thought that was the time and ate all the leathers. Was the smell of blood on those leathers?...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008449	{nl}It was scary. {nl}Ah, I think the monsters there could've not digested the leathers as yet... {nl}Can you bring them? I am curious too.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008450	The people who are progressive are a minority among Anastos.{nl}They are asserting to stop conflicting with Nestos, but instead try to change Nestos.{nl}So that Albinas probably told them he is also progressive.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008451	{nl}So he could make you participate into destroying the sanctums of Nestos.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008452	I can connect the burnt leathers together.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008453	The monsters have those.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008454	Let's see...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008455	{nl}Uh?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008456	{nl}Ah... This doesn't make sense... He...is a subordinate of Vaiga.{nl}Bring a conflict to Nestos and Anastos...{nl}You can use the Revelator...{nl}Vaiga.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008457	Please tell this to Gedas!{nl}Oh my god, what is happening to Fabijus?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008458	We don't have time. Hurry.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008459	What?{nl}Damn it...{nl}The demons came here...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008460	Fabijus... what is happening to him?{nl}What should I do...?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008461	The flame bomb has exploded!{nl}Please hurry to Fabijus!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008462	{nl}And one more thing I should tell you...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008463	{nl}To defeat the demons, Nestos may be better, when you stop by their camp and explain about the circumstances, they would tell you how to defeat Albinas.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008464	Damn...{nl}That was his plot.{nl}I thought it was suspicious.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008465	{nl}Please take this sacred object.{nl}You would be able to defeat the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008466	You are safe.{nl}I've heard from Fabijus.{nl}Everything was Vaiga's plot...{nl}We should be cautious all the time.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008467	It's bad enough that they were killed by the Vubbes, but even their keepsakes are being abused. How awful...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008468	Thank you. {nl} My comrades will now be able to rest in peace.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008469	It hurts to think about giving these keepsakes to my dead comrades' families.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008470	Thank you very much. {nl} My comrades can now rest in peace with the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008471	Damn. {nl}It's too wide, so let's move separately.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008472	First, you go deep into that place.{nl}Who knows? The demons with the special power may possess something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008473	I am so mad.{nl}There isn't anything special and the demons didn't have anything.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008474	Did we search an empty area?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008475	I will search the area up here.{nl}Let's meet later.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008476	How about you?{nl}Have you obtained anything?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008477	Wait!{nl}I can sense something big from Monocle.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008478	It looks to be very big. Go there and check yourself.{nl}I will hide here since the battles are not my type.{nl}I don't know what to do if a strong demon comes out.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008479	Monocle is looking for the hidden object that is hidden inside the special power. It is a big object.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008480	Go there and check.{nl}Like a while ago, the demons may appear and there may be really strong demons there... I will hide myself here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008481	An outsider comes here... Who are you?{nl}How did you come here?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008482	It is really big so you will recognize it when you see it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008483	I will introduce myself first.{nl}I am the manager of the Fortress of the Land.{nl}Who are you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008484	Okay. You don't have to explain anymore.{nl}I can feel you are full of sacred power.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008485	I know the special power which Ruklys hid here exists.{nl}If it is your task to find it, then I will help for sure.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008486	You can't say no nor ask for reasons to the kingdom orders.{nl}But as I lived here for my life, I have many things to think.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008487	The kingdom order told us to ban anyone's entrance here, but I think the goddess made us to meet each other here.{nl}The goddess is not under the kingdom.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008488	If it is about the Goddess, then I will do the guide.{nl}At least, there aren't anything here so let's go to the next area.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008489	Ah, I totally forgot.{nl}I've prepared many things to block the intruders, but I totally forgot about them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008490	I need a certificate.{nl}It was created to attack the ones who are not permitted ferociously.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008491	To make a certificate, we first need a mushroom.{nl}There are many mushrooms at the lower area so please get me one.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008492	I will help anything that is related to the goddesses.{nl}Finally, an opportunity has come in my boring life.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008493	They are enough to make the certificate.{nl}Please wait a bit.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008494	What I can do for you is to put my sign on the certificate.{nl}But, I am too old to use magic.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008495	But, I am sure the energy that is flowing around the Fortress of the Land could substitute my weak power.{nl}Please gather all of those.{nl}The monsters who've lived here for a long time must have the crystal of the great earth.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008496	I am not like the old days.{nl}When I made that certificate, I thought I would never make anymore.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008497	I never knew that I would be making this again... Please wait.{nl}I will make it quickly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008498	Let's go more deep inside. {nl}I hope you can find the one that you are looking for. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008499	I will go there first so please follow.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008500	Don't come late.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008501	Welcome.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008502	Please receive it.{nl}My devices won't attack you anymore.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008503	I've protected this place for my entire life, but I don't know anything about the revelation which you are looking for.{nl}But, the spirit that lived in the era of Ruklys may know something.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008504	But, those spirits are dangerous.{nl}Since they only have the thoughts of that time. Their hatred towards the kingdom soldiers.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008505	The Soul Stones that read the memories of the spirits are beside me.{nl}I've created them. I've tried to read their memories in the past many times.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008506	But, what we received in return were only hatred.{nl}For them, we are just kingdom soldiers that are trying to occupy the Fortress of the Land.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008507	It is unfortunate, but to make them not to go crazy, you would need the Restraint Token.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008508	It is very complex to make the Restraint Token.{nl}We've failed that time, but since we have you this time, it will be much easier this time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008509	I will tell you in steps, so please first bring the eggs of Rajatad.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008510	The spirits only have the feeling of anger left.{nl}I guess we can't do anything about it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008511	This egg is the power to restrain.{nl}Now, we need something to execute the power.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008512	To execute the power, the bones of the demons are the best.{nl}When you get the bones, I will move the power of restraint that is in the eggs to the bones of the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008513	Even I failed to pull out the memories of the spirits.{nl}I feel reliable since you are with me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008514	Well done.{nl}We only have to do the last step in order to complete the Restraint Token.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008515	As I told you before, I've tried to look at the memories of the spirits.{nl}The resistances from the spirits were too aggressive at then, so I failed that time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008516	But, now I have you and the token of restraint.{nl}If we could bring the spirits, we may able to read the memories with the soul stones that are beside me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008517	Please bring the spirits here with the Restraint Token.{nl}I will get prepared.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008518	Please bring the spirits fast.{nl}I am also curious.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008519	They are breaking something after receiving an order from Ruklys.{nl}I think that may be related to the revelation of the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008520	I should find out about the device which Ruklys destroyed.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008521	We can look at the detailed memories of the spirits by enhancing the Restraint Token.{nl}Due to enhanced Restraint Token, the spirits would resist. If the spirits resist, suppress them with your power and use the token of the spirit.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008522	I have no choice even if the spirits suffer. {nl}That's the best way I can help you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008523	Finally found it.{nl}I've been looking for it for 600 years and finally... found the revelation.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008524	Please put the vitality of the monsters into this bone.{nl}Then, the power to restrain, the power to release, and the power to execute, all steps will be put into those.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008525	That's an old method.{nl}If we complete this, you may able to see the memories of the spirits that were with Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008526	Even we if we know the method, it is useless if we can't execute it.{nl}I wasn't able to obtain the vitalities of the monsters...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008527	Good. {nl}That's the Restraint Token.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008528	Don't care that much even if we use the demons.{nl}What's important is that we should look for the revelation of the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008529	Are there spirits that are wandering around the Fortress of the Land without going to the goddesses?{nl}I can't see them suffering anymore.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008530	I can only help you to make the owl sculptures.{nl}Those owls would guide the spirits that lost their ways.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008531	Can you put the owl sculptures at the Fortress of the Land?{nl}If you guide the spirits to the owl sculptures, then you would be able to go beside the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008532	I can't quit carving the owl sculptures.{nl}When I stop carving, then that means the peaceful days have come.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008533	Thanks.{nl}The goddesses must have given use long lives to fulfill these.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008534	I don't have time to think about those treasures.{nl}I also care for the kingdom. I know that the revelation should not fall into the hands of the demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008535	I should meet Eminent around here.{nl}Let's check with Monocle without being noticed by Eminent.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008536	This is as I thought... He is not like the guardian of the revelation.{nl}Otherwise, are the demons the guardians of the revelation?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008537	They are going after the revelation.{nl}What should we do about it...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008538	That's right!{nl}We have that document.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008539	Do you remember?{nl}It's the document that was in the treasure when we went to the hidden place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008540	The methods of the activation and the repair of the magic circle is written there to face against the demons at the battle field.{nl}If we somehow use them effectively, we may able to block Eminent.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008541	First, you do what Eminent tells you to do.{nl}And let's secretly activate the magic circle with me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008542	Did it go well?{nl}The last thing is near the Ikbeta Platform.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008543	But, the power of the magic circle is getting suppressed due to the flags of the demons.{nl}I've tried to get near it somehow, but I can't due to the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008544	Let's pull out the demon flags that are near the magic circle.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008545	Ah, if you go late, Eminent may suspect you.{nl}Go meet Eminent as the magic circle gets activated.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008546	I believe that Ruklys has not colluded with the demons.{nl}If not, what I saw are all lies.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008547	Have you collected all the parts?{nl}Give it to me. I can restore it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008548	I want you to meet the revelation of the goddess fast.{nl}To fulfill my lifelong wish...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008549	I will not hide it anymore.{nl}I am Premier Eminent and I used to serve King Kadumel.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008550	It's up to you to believe, but I want you to give me an opportunity to at least explain this.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008551	I am sure that you know this place is the last battlefield where Ruklys resisted until his death.{nl}And Ruklys was also the guardian of the revelation like his master, Maven.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008552	But, as the defeat came, he crossed the line which he should not have crossed.{nl}He made an alliance with the demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008553	The Fortress of the Land is full of vicious demons and monsters. {nl}That's why I brought my army here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008554	It was a long battle. But the battle ended with my victory.{nl}And then the voices of the goddess was heard. To protect the revelation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008555	But, I don't know how Ruklys hid the revelation.{nl}He is just a half guardian.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008556	It's up to you to believe this story, but look at me in front of you.{nl}I've been living with the blessing from the goddesses for the last 600 years.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008557	And I've met you at the end.{nl}And you pulled me to the place where the revelation is.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008558	It is my honor since I can be helpful to you. {nl}I was suffering from the sense of shame since I don't know what the half guardian could do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008559	Let's finish the explanation here and go look for the revelation of the goddesses.{nl}I have things to prepare so I will go there first.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008560	Ah, you still haven't left?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008561	I've thought about it a lot. {nl}I am sure that the person who've been to this deep is just me among the grave thieves!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008562	We should record this historic moment.{nl}Can you bring some stones where I could record my achievements?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008563	What should I write on the stones? {nl}If you have any thoughts, please let me know.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008564	I know that it is hard to bring something that is that big.{nl}Thank you. I will think what to write on it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008565	Isn't this the diary of Ruklys? {nl}I am sure that more than this. Can you look for more?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008566	When you bring this to Wilhelmina Carriot, she will pay you accordingly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008567	Okay. This is enough.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008568	The history which we know are all lies. He was killed by the hands of the one he used to love.{nl}Ruklys, he is an unfortunate man.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008569	It's good to see that you are still alive.{nl}Do you remember? When I first looked through this Monocle.{nl}I thought the object is hidden by the special force, but when I went there there were only demons there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008570	And when you entered the habitants' area, you've checked it with Monocle right?{nl}The strong force was detected so I remember that I told you to check.{nl}You told me that there is only an old manager there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008571	Since then, I've been keep looking for that force with this monocle... {nl}But, when I went to the places, only demons were there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008572	Maybe...{nl}The true nature of the force that can be seen by Monocle is maybe... demons?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008573	That old manager... I have no idea...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008574	I hope my assumptions are wrong.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008575	The demons did not attack Premier Eminent? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008576	I need to check it. {nl}Let's go together and meet that Eminent guy. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008577	We will know for sure if you check that guy with the Monocle. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008578	Mirtis is gone, but the Vubbes are still following Mirtis' commands. {nl}And there is also a rumor that even stronger and more dangerous Vubbes were seen. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008579	Most of them died while returning with the prince's men.{nl}But they were not guided by the goddess even after their death. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008580	I want to mourn for those who died unfairly. {nl}Would you like to join me? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008581	Chapparition will not bring back the lives of those who died.{nl}It's a sad thing.. But we can't just leave it like that. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008582	What? You're not a reaper? {nl}But since you've seen my face, you will be cursed. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008583	Huhu. Poor guy. He won't be able to see the light soon. {nl}Whether it's in prison or coffin, only he will know. {nl} I feel sorry for the dead soldiers.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008584	The Legwyn family was a renowned family. {nl}But since the disappearance of Justina's father, Gailus Legwyn, other members of the family and their deities all fell sick and died. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008585	The mansion where Justina used to live... is now full of monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008586	I went through great lengths to get a chance to meet Erikas,{nl}a longtime friend of the Legwyn family.{nl}He also possesses the Legwyn family's heirloom but...{nl}I didn't expect him to behave like this. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008587	The guy doesn't even know where the graves of the Legwyn family are...{nl}I strongly suspect he's an impostor.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008588	Then we have no choice.{nl}As Erikas said, can you find Legwyn at Mires Grave using the Scroll of the Dead?{nl}I will stay here so that Erikas won't escape. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008589	So he didn't really tell us the location of Legwyn grave because he doesn't know...?{nl}Didn't he say he would tell you if you give him some money?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008590	To wake me up as I was about to go beside the goddesses... {nl}What do you need of me?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008591	There's a long story behind it, but what Erikas said is largely correct.{nl}I was chasing after the Kartas Hunter with my vassals.{nl}Initially, our strength was lacking.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008592	Thus, I told Erikas to lend us his power to defeat the Kartas Hunter since he lived nearby.{nl}Erikas asked for our heirloom as collateral in return for lending me the Blessing Crystal.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008593	He told me that we would be able to defeat the demon with the Crystal.{nl}Attempting to defeat it proved difficult, so we ended up just sealing the demon.{nl}Many lives were sacrificed to seal it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008594	The Kartas Hunter is locked inside the seal in front of you.{nl}The power that is restraining the demon is from the Blessing Crystal lent by Erikas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008595	The Kartas Hunter will not be able to get out from here as this current state.{nl}But, my daughter... I have to take back our heirloom for Justina's sake.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008596	I can release the Kartas Hunter from the Crystal's seal by myself, but{nl}in order to preserve the power of the Crystal, we will need help from the vassals.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008597	I don't want to ask Erikas for help again...{nl}If you could gather the Spirit Incenses growing on Mochia Fields, we will be able to wake up my vassals.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008598	When we fought the Kartas Hunter, someone had to stay focused on the Crystal.{nl}My team fell one by one, the battle situation worsened as fewer people could focus on the Crystal.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008599	In the end, everyone dedicated their lives to seal the Kartas Hunter.{nl}Still, as me and my vassals don't have real bodies now, we won't be disturbed by it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008600	I can sense some sacred power within you.{nl}If you could eliminate that demon, we will help.{nl}Please complete the task that we couldn't complete...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008601	There was a pitiful girl that I was taking care of.{nl}She didn't have a family and was very quiet.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008602	As she started to stay in my mansion, demons started to appear near the mansion...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008603	One day, an incident occurred where one of my vassals was killed by poison. {nl}Of course, everyone suspected that the girl did it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008604	Soon the girl ran away. {nl}I don't know why, but there was a voice deep inside my heart, echoing to protect her.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008605	Since we were able to sealed the Kartas Hunter here, she was able to run away safely.{nl}Even if it turned out like this, I don't have any regrets.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008606	It's not that I allowed it because of good faith or that I was aware of how people saw her.{nl}But, I feel sorry for my family... that they couldn't see Justina.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008607	The Spirit Incenses have the power to pull out the memories of the dead.{nl}I will put the power of the Scroll of the Dead here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008608	As you were able to pull me out, you will be able to pull out my vassals.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008609	My vassals are sleeping at Kruva Stream Bank.{nl}I regret that I couldn't prepare a good spot for their graves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008610	You will be able to wake up my vassals when you rub the Spirit Incenses onto their gravestones.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008611	I am to blame for this.{nl}They're like family, yet they are resting on grounds without calm winds...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008612	I am happy to meet my vassals again because of you.{nl}Their spirits continue to have great determination.{nl}They will fulfill our mission even after their deaths.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008613	Next, we'll be releasing the Kartas Hunter.{nl}But the power of the Blessing Crystal is too powerful. I see no easy way to release the demon...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008614	We have no choice but to try a dirty method.{nl}We will need to use some corrupt energy sources to weaken the powerful divine power.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008615	Defeat some monsters and bring their Corrupt Fangs.{nl}If we can weaken the power of the crystal with them, the demon will attempt to come out unaware that it's a trap.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008616	And that will be our last chance to eliminate it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008617	Thank you for helping us thus far.{nl} Thank you for listening to the final wishes of the dead...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008618	I can feel the fangs' corrupt energy.{nl}Since I don't want you get corrupted by them, let's finish this quickly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008619	Place the Corrupt Fangs near the seal. {nl}Then, our last mission will start.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008620	Everything is over...{nl}It is so fortunate that it ended even after our deaths
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008621	Thank you again. Please pass this crystal to my daughter's friend.{nl}Now, I will return to the goddesses together with my vassals.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008622	If you meet my daughter, please tell her that I'm really sorry and that I love her...{nl}I hope you can pass my words to her.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008623	I wonder who's the girl who Legwyn tried to protect until his death?{nl}Nevertheless, I'm sure he'll rest in peace since his last mission has been fulfilled.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008624	I will return this to Erikas now.{nl}I really appreciate your help on behalf of my friend, Justina Legwyn.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008625	I can tell you this at least.{nl}The keepsakes of Lydia Schaffen...{nl}I came out from the Astral Tower to protect them with my colleagues.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008626	The preceding leader suspiciously died and Ignas became the next leader of the Astral Tower.{nl}Then, his tyranny started.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008627	He told everyone that the old rules of Lydia Schaffen were to be abandoned and that we should start over...{nl}He said to eliminate everything that was related to Lydia Schaffen.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008628	But Lydia Schaffen was everything to the Astral Tower, she was the symbolic figure of all archers.{nl}After we regained consciousness, we ran away with our colleagues and the keepsakes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008629	Right now... I can hardly move due to my injury...{nl}But if I stay like this, the pursuers will find out about me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008630	I think we should move.{nl}Can you lure the pursuers so I can go to the Guoda Empty Lot?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008631	When we fire this disposable signal bomb, they'll follow you.{nl}I'm counting on you...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008632	As you lure them, I will move secretly.{nl}Let's meet at Guoda Empty Lot.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008633	We were able to move safely due to your help.{nl}You seem like a good person so please receive this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008634	This is the book recorded about the Roxona Conflict.{nl}I am not sure whether you are interested, but please receive it as a token of my gratitude.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008635	Ah, I came up with a good idea when the pursuers ran towards the signal bomb you fired.{nl}I'm going to make a trap by attaching signal bomb onto a bomb.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008636	That way, my colleagues will know that I'm here...{nl}Maybe it will also lure the demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008637	To do so, we need to something to make smoke with...{nl}I've used everything I had already so...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008638	Good. I saw Red Leaves as I ran away to Ruda Trail. {nl}Can you collect them?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008639	Many people left the Astral Tower as the tyranny of the leader Ignas continued.{nl}I tried my best to endure, but...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008640	I could not endure when he was trying to eliminate the keepsakes of Lydia Schaffen.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008641	How come I haven't thought about this. {nl}I should have set the traps already...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008642	Lastly, can you put this trap over there on Ruda Trail?{nl}I'll hide here until I recover.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008643	My colleagues who were on the same side with me would also be chased by now.{nl}We were to meet at Orsha, but I don't know how far they've come...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008644	How did you get a hold of Irmantas' signal bombs?{nl}You must be either brave or stupid.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008645	Our brothers who were on my side are also being chased at the moment.{nl}We were gonna meet at Orsha, but I don't know how far they've come.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008646	So you're the one who helped Irmantas.{nl}Hmm. Are you hurt at all?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008647	I want to get together with Irmantas, but I'm in bad shape.{nl}One mistake, and we might interfere with each other...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008648	I'm going to go to Orsha from here.{nl}I'm sorry, but can you hand this over to him?{nl}Just tell him that it's taken from the Astral Tower.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008649	I'll leave first.{nl}I also heard that Alina is also wandering around here...{nl}I hope you can find her if possible.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008650	Who are you?{nl}You don't seem to be Ignas' pursuer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008651	Ah... You've already met Irmantas and Grazina.{nl}That's good. I have to meet Irmantas right away since I have the words to pass him!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008652	I've seen it for sure.{nl}The demons were among the chasers of Ignas.{nl}They seemed to be close to each other.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008653	I am sure Ignas has colluded with the demons.{nl}I think eliminating the keepsakes of Lydia Schaffen is a part of that collusion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008654	But, I was badly hurt as well...{nl}I am not sure if I can meet Irmantas again in my life.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008655	Can you defeat the monsters around here so I can get to him?{nl}If you reduce the number of monsters, then the possibility of getting detected by monsters will be lowered.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008656	At first, I thought the pursuers that were following from the Astral Tower were subordinates of Ignas.{nl}But, they weren't. There's something we don't know yet!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008657	It's noisy around here so I guess the pursuers are near.{nl}We should move quickly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008658	If we just stay here, we'll get attacked without having notified anyone...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008659	Please take me to Irmantas.{nl}We have to tell Lydia Schaffen's followers that they're colluding with the demons!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008660	They'd be easy to defeat if I didn't have this injury...{nl}Where is Irmantas now?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008661	No... I feel like I am going to lose consciousness if I walk little more.{nl}I feel like I am hearing the voice... of the goddess.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008662	After I ran away from the Astral Tower, I've never seen a person who is so kind and reliable like you.{nl}If something happens to me... {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008663	Please tell Irmantas about the plot of Iganas with this letter.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008664	Let's go. {nl}I will cheer myself up a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008665	What happened?{nl}I think I've heard a some noise from down there...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008666	Illina... was attacked?{nl}How can Ignas do something without going crazy!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008667	I will follow the words of Lydia Schaffen on behalf of Illina.{nl}I will arrive at Orsha no matter what it takes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008668	To you... I want to give you some rewards since you've protected me until the end.{nl}I am sure Illina and Lydia Schaffen also want me to do that.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008715	You're here? {nl}What did Eminent say? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008716	Good thing he doesn't seem to find anything suspicious. {nl}We must not give any parts to Eminent until the magic circle of Ruklys is activated. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008717	I figured the location of the magic circle as written in the document. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008718	First, the magic circle under Slypti Watchtower. {nl}The writings on the pole were erased so the magic circle is not working. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008719	It will work when you write on it again. {nl}I'll take care of the magic circle below so I'll leave this to you. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008720	Be sure not to be caught by Eminent. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008721	I saw the magic circles activate. Are you alright? {nl}What about Eminent? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008722	You defeated Eminent and obtained the revelation? {nl}Wow, you're way better than I thought... {nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008730	I will surely bring it back to hometown. {nl}My fellows will want that too. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008731	Come to think of it, there is a sacred object of the goddess in Sielvar Prayer Room. {nl}I think offering a prayer to that sacred object will give us some answers. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008732	The dead that wakes up again are the problems. {nl}Why don't we purify them and keep them from waking up. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008733	We break their coffin before they wake up. {nl}Even for the dead ones, it will be better than forcibly waking up. {nl}What do you think? Will you help? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008734	You must be careful not to open the coffin lid when you break the coffin. {nl}When the coffin opens, the dead will jump out and attack.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008735	Good work. {nl}I'm sure they will also thank you for making them rest in peace. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008736	The problem is that sacred object. {nl}I can't approach anywhere near it because of the barrier. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008737	Maybe the grave keeper would know something about the sacred object and the barrier...{nl}But the grave keeper doesn't like me. We had a thing in the past. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008738	I met the grave keeper while working on purifying in the name of the goddess. {nl}I was actually helping the grave keeper but he was really mad about it. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008739	The grave keeper stands at the end of Vepavi Corridor. {nl}Can you ask him about the sacred object of the goddess for me? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008740	A sacred object of the goddess? {nl}What? Are you teaming up with that rude Bokor? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008741	Get out of this grave site. {nl}Just thinking about that Bokor brings back my anger. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008742	That Bokor went around breaking the coffins of the dead saying they rise back! {nl}I don't understand how he can do such a thing with a sane mind!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008743	sacred object that you can't even approach... {nl}I understand if they block the monsters or demons from getting close to it but even humans, that I don't understand.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008744	These people from the Order of the Tree of Truth or whatever were here first before Bokor Utara.{nl}They claimed that they were officially acknowledged by Goddess Zemyna or something?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008745	They said they'd carry out the will of Goddess Zemyna since this land was blessed by her. {nl}How could I have stopped that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008746	But since their arrival, the dead started to rise again. {nl}If that was on purpose, there couldn't have been an insult worse than that! {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008747	That was giving me a headache already, and then some Bokor comes along breaking the coffins. {nl}Breaking the coffins to purify the dead does not show any respect for the dead!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008748	That is not important. {nl}I want to calm all this fuss as soon as possible. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008749	If you help me, then I will believe that the Bokor didn't come here with bad intentions. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008750	Burying it back in the ground is not all. {nl}Pay respect to the dead using this match and cremate their bodies. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008751	What are you waiting for! Move quickly! {nl}I cannot... handle it anymore. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008752	Sorry for being sharp a while ago. I was a bit sensitive. {nl}Actually, having to point the blades to people whom I should {nl}take care of as a grave keeper is not something I am comfortable with. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008753	Thank you for giving them peace for me. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008754	Anyway, I know of the sacred object of the goddess that the Bokor mentioned.{nl}Those people from Order of the Tree of Truth made it one day. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008755	Maybe that is why the dead rose... {nl}I had my suspicions but I couldn't approach it either. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008756	Ah! That's right. {nl}A long time ago, a Bokor and a Necromancer not in their sane minds used to come here secretly. {nl}They used to do insane experiments on the dead who are rested in here. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008757	So my father learned how to make spell dolls from the guards nearby Klaipeda. {nl}He said if you put spells on the spell dolls, it finds the power {nl}that messes with the grave and destroys it or something? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008758	There is a chest in Kansias Stone Chamber with my father's belongings. {nl}There should be a spell doll in it. I don't think I can... make it through the bodies. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008759	Our family has been grave keepers for generations. {nl}My father passed away during the disaster on Medzio Diena, so I have taken his place since then. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008760	I only learned over hid shoulders... {nl}But I am the grave keeper of this place now. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008761	Right! This is it.{nl}It wasn't used for a long time, but it should work well since father made it. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008762	Done. Now go to the sacred object. {nl}If that sacred object is the reason behind the dead rising here, {nl}the spell dollwill break the barrier and destroy the sacred object. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008763	It's the spell doll that father used. {nl}If we do as my father used to do, then nothing will go wrong. Just as my father used to do...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008764	If the spell doll attacked the sacred object, then it means it detected the evil energy. {nl}But the spell doll was the one destroyed... {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008765	Anyway, if the barrier broke, then your Bokor friend must be able to identify it. {nl}What about going back to that Bokor and asking her?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008766	Huh? You really broke the barrier? {nl}See, I knew the grave keeper would help. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008767	Actually, I was a but suspicious myself. {nl}I felt a bad energy from the barrier considering that it {nl}was something that covered the goddess' sacred object.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008768	Anyway, since the barrier is now broken, let's go together. {nl}If it really is a sacred object of the goddess, then it will react to the prayer for the goddess. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008769	Will you go ahead first? {nl}I will follow as soon as I'm ready for the prayer. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008770	A spell doll... Evil energy... It really is suspicious.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008771	Thank you for saving me. I almost went to the goddess. {nl}I guess it is a lie that it was a sacred object of the goddess. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008772	The object of the goddess would not summon such a monster. {nl}I smell something fishy with that Order of the Tree of Truth. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008773	Since the object here wasn't real, we must find Goddess Zemyna's traces from somewhere else. {nl}It's alright. If something like this makes me frustrated, {nl}then I would not have kept my journey until here. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008774	But before I leave, I must help the grave keeper and keep the fuss down. {nl}Now that the evil object is gone, my abilities will help keep this place calm. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008775	I want to show my sincerity to the grave keeper, but{nl}the image of him being angry at me holds me back. {nl}If you're on the way to the grave keeper, can you send him my sincerity as well? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008776	No wonder. That object wasn't that of the goddess. {nl}Using the name of the goddess into tricks like this. They have really crossed the line. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008777	I want to go and make them pay for it right away. {nl}However, as a grave keeper, keeping this place secure comes first. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008778	Was that Bokor's name Juta? {nl}Her ability powers will be of much help. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008779	The Order of the Tree of Truth went in to the Carlyle's Mausoleum. {nl}They said they will find something to carry out their order or something...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008780	If you ever go to Carlyle's Mausoleum, be careful about them. {nl}No matter how much I think about it, they are not in their right minds. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008781	If this is not it either, I can't help but be exhausted. {nl}Where do you think Goddess Zemyna has gone? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008782	Oh my god, the Divine Tree! {nl}The Divine Tree answered my prayers and sent someone to save me!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008783	Thank you. I thought death was the only option for me. {nl}I am Gintas, a follower of the Order of the Tree of Truth. {nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008786	You are really strong, just as someone sent by the Divine Tree should be. {nl}Such strength should be used for something bigger. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008787	I am collecting the spirit of the dead that rose back, as the order told me to. {nl}Margiris can read the memories of the dead when they were alive from the spirit stones. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008788	She finds the sins of the dead from their memories and forgives them to purify the sins in this world. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008789	I seem to have sprained my ankle while running away from the dead. I can't walk. {nl}Can you help me by any chance?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008790	I'm sure my prayers reached the Divine Tree to send you here. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008791	Brother. {nl}By this, your sins have become lighter.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008793	Carrying out sacred missions can get you to some trouble like just a while ago. {nl}You can also lose your life. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008794	Bodies of followers are brought to Seima Stone Chamber and their sins are purified. {nl}But because of Margiris' sacred abilities, some actually get their life back. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008795	The followers who rise back can't throw away their regrets in life and keep roaming around this place. {nl}Please use this flint to cremate the regrets and soulless bodies of the dead. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008796	Margiris told us salvation is not something we can get so easily. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008797	This work purifies the sins of the foolish as well as ours. {nl}Those who die during the process is because their belief is not enough. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008798	Only those who stand it will earn salvation. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008799	Poor Gintas... {nl}You've dealt with the despair of death alone. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008800	Hey. If you are thinking of joining the order, don't bother. {nl}I, myself, used to be a follower of Margiris. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008801	I used to focus on purifying the sins of the dead like Gintas. {nl}I thought I would earn salvation. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008802	But one day, I saw the record books of Margiris. {nl}As far as I knew, those book keep a record of the process of purifying the sins of the dead. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008803	But it was actually a record of land ownership. {nl}And I also found out that he was looking for the record of the Carlyle in here. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008804	When I read until that part of the books, Margiris killed me. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008805	Amazing. Did righteousness bring you here?{nl}Look. Defeating Margiris does not mean anything. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008806	If Margiris' mission fails, the Order will send someone else in here... {nl}And innnocent disciples will turn like this again. {nl}Nothing will change.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008822	Can you try to persuade Carlyle? {nl}Since he doesn't know your face, try to act as if you're not part of the Order. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008823	If you find out the whereabouts of the documents, I will bless you with the grace of the Divine Tree.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008830	Such awful people. {nl}Setting that up as a holy relic... {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008831	I think that seal has weakened the energy of that thing. {nl}It must have thought that we're on the same side. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008832	Anyway, since you've taken care of that horrible thing, I will believe what you say. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008833	No wonder it was suspicious. That leader wasn't human! {nl}Right, that thing wasn't human... {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008834	Why are they making such a fuss in this grave. What are they after? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008835	After hearing your story, it seems that they are after {nl}the ownership of a villa in the Kaliss province. {nl}There is a copy of the list of villa owners that I used to handle when I was alive. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008836	They must have wanted to get their hands on that copy and use it to make {nl}false testimony claiming that the lands in Kaliss belong to them. {nl}Fortunately, it seems like they were not able to find it. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008837	I suspected something like this to happen and hid the list in Seima Stone Chamber. {nl}Can you gather the scattered list of villa owners? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008838	The villa ownership is supposed to be managed by the next generation of deputies... {nl}But he was not someone to be trusted so I requested that the manuscript {nl}of records be buried with me when I die in my will. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008839	He may look like a good guy but even as a public official, {nl}he had private meetings with unknown people... {nl}And I caught him forging records at one point.  
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008840	It gives me the chills thinking that they could have found the records. {nl}If they are preying on each province records like this, then only Kaliss {nl}but the whole kingdom will fall under the hands of the demons soon. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008841	Good. {nl}Those are the records of the land owners in the Kaliss province. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008842	Now, we have to engrave the spell doll with the energy that messes the grave. {nl}I saw the site where they cremated the dead a while ago {nl}and there was a black crystal that I've never seen before. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008843	I'm sure the black crystals are the traces of evil magic that woke up the dead. {nl}Can you get more of it from the dead that rose? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008844	Ah, I will take care of the fallen dead bodies. {nl}For now there is something more important to do. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008845	Yeah, this will be enough. {nl}I will prepare the spell doll right away. Hold on. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008846	What? You are not a follower of that Order? {nl}Are you telling me to believe you? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008847	Alright. {nl}Then destroy that holy relic that they claim to have received the blessings of the goddess. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008848	I have never seen a blessed holy relic fume evil energy. {nl}I think that relic is messing this gravesite. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008849	I brought the Kaliss land owners list to my grave to stop the corruption of the next generation. {nl}But to think of it, this record has now become useless. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008850	Since they will siege for this document again. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008851	I will give this record to you. If you make sure destroy it, I will be able to lay in peace again. {nl}Please.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008852	It doesn't make sense no matter how much I think of it. {nl}How did they find this place. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008853	Villa ownership is actually a very sensitive matter so the records are not really known to public. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008854	Only the current deputy knows that I have handled the records. {nl}How did they know about this place... 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008855	It's strange. {nl}To have a barrier blocking people from approaching the holy relic.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008856	Even if it is sacred, if that is how it is, no one can approach it. {nl}I mean, it's as if it doesn't want anybody to come near it. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008857	Place this Evil Thoughts Stone then defeat the dead nearby.{nl}The souls of the dead will be absorbed into this stone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008858	This cleanses the sins of the dead and yours too. {nl}Also, Margiris will be very happy about it. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008859	Good luck then.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009592	My name is Serapinas, a newcomer of the Kedoran Merchant Alliance.{nl}I'm promoting the Merchant Alliance at the moment.{nl}Umm... If you have the time, would you mind helping me do some promotion?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009593	Edita
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009594	I am Edita. I am in charge of the Retrieval team for the Merchant Alliance.{nl}I'm sure you're curious as to why we're retrieving items here.{nl}You may have heard from Leopoldas, but we are providing much needed items and materials to people.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009595	{nl}I was carting items for the Merchant Alliance like any other day past here towards Fedimian.{nl}But I could have never known. That it would be later known as Medzio Diena...{nl}All of our carts were upturned... The items in those carts burried all over.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009596	{nl}That's why retrieval teams were created, and why I am here.{nl}Some are locating them with detectors for more efficient retrieval.{nl}Some are going to those locations for excavation.{nl}If you wish to help, there's a spot there that we've marked so bring the item after carefully digging it out.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009597	There are many monsters nearby that are threatening the members of the Merchant Alliance.{nl}Could you clear them out for us?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009598	Be careful.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009599	Thank you for bringing it back.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009600	The excavation team has just reported that there is something burried there.{nl}Could you take a look?{nl}It'll take a while for the retrieval team to get there...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009601	Theses are records from the Merchant Alliance.{nl}They're ripped to pieces.{nl}Most likely done by monsters.{nl}Give them here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009602	These are records of the arrow materials the Merchant Alliance had previously provided to Lydia Schaffen and the first Fletcher Master.{nl}It is too difficult for me to restore, so we'll have to try in the city.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009603	There should be something north of here as well.{nl}I can't seem to find exactly where though.{nl}I'll give you the detector so why don't you give it a try.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009604	Try carefully digging there after you've located it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009605	Try using the detector as you go slowly upwards.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009606	{nl}This is a mysterious Ink. {nl}It's a secret Ink used to write important documents.{nl}We suspect that it was used to hide records.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009607	{nl}Ah, we'll take care of the rest by ourselves.{nl}You've been a great help!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009608	Hello.{nl}I am Margellius the record keeper for the Kedoran Merchant Alliance.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009609	{nl}You've come on the request of Leopoldas.{nl}Then could you retrieve the educational materials taken by the monsters?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009610	You saw the newcomers that are under Leopoldas right?{nl}It's neccessary material for their education.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009611	If we retrieve the information that the monsters have taken, I'm planning on creating more copies to give to the newcomers.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009612	Now I'll record more information.{nl}Ink crafted from the fluids of monsters lasts a long time and is durable.{nl}I'll give you some traps, so could you get some for me?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009613	Plant the trap near monsters.{nl}The monsters will faint when they step on the trap...{nl}You'll then be able to extract their fluids when they're still alive.{nl}But, only the monsters over there have the neccessary fluids.{nl}So use the trap over there.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009614	It can only be obtained from the monsters at the plaza over there.{nl}Use the trap near them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009615	Now I can craft tombstones.{nl}Try making one yourself.{nl}I'll give you the materials and tools again.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009616	Good job.{nl}I'm sure Giedra over there will also require your help.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009617	Bookbinding is also an important part of making a scripture.{nl}You have to bind them with sturdy string.{nl}String made from monster leather is ideal, but they are too short.{nl}I'll give you an anvil so would you mind creating Bookbinding String from the leather straps?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009618	Listen up. First gather leather straps from monsters, then use this anvil to craft Lump of Sturdy Strings for Bookbinding with them.{nl}Connect the short pieces into a longer string for bookbinding.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009619	You're amazing!{nl}Now all that's left is my part.{nl}Thank you for helping me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009620	Everything is in order now! Now I'll go to Fasika Plateau!{nl}Hahahahahahahahaha!!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009621	Oh come on...{nl}The Nestos sign was created after the falling out with the Anastos.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009622	{nl}Antanas and Giedra here seem to be holding it, but why do I keep losing it so often...{nl}Anyways, I want to go on a pilgrimage to Fasika Plateau where there are more Nestos now!{nl}Thank you!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009623	Pill?{nl}You should be able to get that from the equipment merchant.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009624	Take care on the long road ahead.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009625	Yes. I've prepared the pill you've requested.{nl}Farewell.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009626	Have you retrieved the pill?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009627	Now go.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009628	Thank you so much for saving me!{nl}I am Albinas from the Anastospa.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009629	This is a tombstone erected by the people of Nestospa as an offering to the goddess.{nl}As you can see, it has become so defiled that it is attracting mobs of monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009630	What could Nestospa possibly be thinking...{nl}What good are sanctums and tombstones when the goddess is missing?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009631	They can keep making them, but they're all just going to get defiled like this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009632	Unlike them, the people of Anastospa have a good grasp of reality.{nl}We know that our priority should be saving the people we can actually see before us and getting rid of the demons, rather than thinking about the goddess who is already gone.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009633	What do you think?{nl}How about helping us get rid of the demons even if our beliefs are slightly different.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009634	Even though the goddess is gone now, Nestospa continues to pursue its faith blindly.{nl}That is why they keep building these sanctuaries everywhere.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009635	{nl}Human life comes first, and then our next priority is wiping out the demons we can see before us, and beyond that, as long as the goddess has abandoned us, is there even a need for faith anymore?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009636	Thank you so much for agreeing to help me.{nl}We really need to teach Nestospa a lesson.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009637	There are more than a few defiled tombstones.{nl}I shall destroy this one, so you go and destroy the tombstones over there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009638	That tombstone over there should also be glowing red.{nl}Just like the tombstone next to you. It's evidence that it has been defiled.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009639	What is this...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009640	Who're you? {nl}Who do you think you are, touching our tombstone?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009641	This is Nestospa's sacred tombstone.{nl}Are you the one that did this to our tombstone?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009642	I've never seen or heard of anyone like that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009643	I don't know every member of the Anastos...{nl}But I know most of them since we are from the same church.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009644	I am at a loss for words.{nl}Albinas? A member of the Anastos? It can't be!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009645	Bring him to me! {nl}I must see for myself!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009646	You'll take responsibility and restore the tombstone?{nl}I really don't like you, but if you're willing to do that, I guess I've got no choice.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009647	I'm only agreeing to this for the goddess' sake.{nl}Luckily there are lots of stones around here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009648	Obtain some suitable stone blocks and go find Eduinas at the Nestos Camp over there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009649	Eduinas will not be happy if he knows that you've done this to the tombstone.{nl}Get ready to take responsibility for that at the very least.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009650	Are you almost done yet? If you're going to take responsibility, you should get hustlin'.{nl}Don't just linger around here wasting time.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009651	Who are you?{nl}And what is this rock you've got here?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009652	What? You destroyed the tombstone?{nl}We worked so hard to erect that tombstone and you destroyed it?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009653	I don't need your apology.{nl}Since Damijonas requested it, I'll start working on this, but please don't ever do that again.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009654	I don't want to see you while I get the materials ready.{nl}Go and clear the area of monsters or something.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009655	I need more time.{nl}I can't just magically make a tombstone appear out of thin air, you know.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009656	All done. {nl}Now, don't do that ever again.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009657	You've gathered the neccessary items. Let's see if we can repair it.{nl}It's lucky that it wasn't damaged too badly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009658	We've never had any trouble with Anastos, just some different opinions.{nl}We have to be suspicious since we've heard a name that we know nothing about.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009659	Especially since they've destroyed the tombstone that we've barely managed to craft.{nl}We'll forgive them since they've taken responsibility.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009660	However, it's very strange.{nl}I have never heard of that name.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009661	Aren't you dejected to go like this?{nl}Anastos has their camp up there so why don't you go ask them.This is strange...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009662	Yes, of Anastos... that is correct.{nl}You've come here to ask about something?{nl}Oh dear, I am quite flustered at the moment so it's a bit difficult to answer anything..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009663	We might get a break if you can manage to retrieve the research materials that I'm looking for.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009664	They're my research records, but the monsters took off with them for some reason.{nl} I'm going out of my mind trying to figure out what's missing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009665	I'll be able to talk to you once I get those documents back.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009666	They're my research records, but the monsters took off with them for some reason.{nl} I'm going out of my mind trying to figure out what's missing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009667	These are the data with the differences between Anastos and Nestos.{nl}There should be an opportunity to explain after finding the data.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009668	Let's see...{nl} This one's here... That one's not here... Now where's that one...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009669	Oh, yes.{nl} You've found them all.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009670	{nl}What was it you wanted to ask me about?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009671	Albinas?{nl} I haven't heard that name before.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009672	And you say he spoke of Anastospa and told you to destroy the tombstone?{nl} No way, we would never do anything like that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009673	Both Nestospa and we are people who revere the goddess and are focused in our faith.{nl} Though we are a bit more realistic in our pursuits than the people of Nestos are.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009674	Focusing on defeating demons and preparing for calamities.. {nl}More than simply devout faith in the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009675	This is definitely strange. {nl}We'll need to send someone to investigate.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009676	Oh, we'll have to give him a flare in case of trouble.. But there seems to be a lack of useful materials.{nl}Could you gather some if you have the time?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009677	Get me some flamable powder.{nl}It won't be too difficult to find since there are always more than enough monsters.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009678	By the way Alvydas.. You are really awkward.{nl}For what reasons have you mentioned our faction?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009679	Now we'll have to wait for the results.{nl}He's a capable person, so it won't take too long.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009680	How about doing some investigation ourselves in the meanwhile.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009681	Of course. Barte might know something.{nl}He hasn't been here too long and he's quite the knowledgeable chap.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009682	How about asking him about the person called Albinas?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009683	I will wait for Fabijus here.{nl}It'd be great to bring back a certain answer.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009684	I am indeed Barte.{nl}What's the matter?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009685	Albinas?{nl}Umm.. I did see a person that looks similar to what you've described.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009686	She was strange.{nl}Since only the pilgrims visit this place, it was quite a strange sight.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009687	She was staring absently at something leather-like then suddenly teared it apart.{nl}To do such a feat with bare hands.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009688	It wasn't the strength of a human. I was trembling.{nl}They disappeared soon after throwing away the shredded leather.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009689	There might still be a bit of leather left if you head down there. I.. I'm too afraid to go even if it was an order from a goddess.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009690	I believe that lether is still there.{nl}As for me.. I would not have courage to venture into the place even if it is the will of goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009691	I have no idea what's hidden in the leather.{nl}I hope there's a bit of leather left.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009692	What if the monsters have eaten it?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009693	Let me take a look.{nl}Hm..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009694	I have seen this crest before..{nl}Ah.. Ah!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009695	I remember now. I've seen it in a book.{nl}It's the crest of the Lunatic Demon King, Vaiga!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009696	What on earth could be happening.{nl}No one else uses such insignia unless they work for Vaiga.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009697	We have to alert the others about this!{nl}You go tell Gedas!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009698	There's no time.{nl}Hurry!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009699	What?{nl}No way... You think Vaiga has sent his pawn?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009700	Fabijus.. What's going to happen to him?{nl}What should we do?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009701	We must let everyone know!{nl}Please, notify Gedas!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009702	To get rid of demons, they are much more adequate than us.{nl}They'll surely help if you can explain the situation to them!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009703	Oh dear, you mean, we have been played by the demons all along?{nl}I knew something was fishy!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009704	It's dangerous to go alone, take this Holy Water.{nl}It can do one hell of damage.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009705	Thank goodness, you are safe.{nl}Fabijus told me about who Albinas really was.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009706	Those demons threatened us after their covers have been blown and you saved us.{nl}It truly must be the will of goddess that you came. I thank you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009707	Are you hearing yourself right now?{nl}You have a lot of nerve coming back after breaking the stele.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009708	Do you expect me to believe that you were just following what someone whom you don't even know very well nor be able to bring here said?{nl}Seriously?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009709	Words fail me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009710	Nevermind!{nl}Such irreverence..
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009711	What do you want now?{nl}I am too busy figuring out how to restore the stele. Leave me alone.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009712	Have you told others about the identity of Albinas?{nl}My guess is that you rushed to get here..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009713	Could you forward the story to them as well?{nl}We will put aside our differences and actively find the solution.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009714	What happened to that demon?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009715	I'm glad to hear that Holy Water that I gave you was of some use.{nl}It's terrifying to think that demons walking among us and dividing us. They must be really desperate.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009716	Could you inform Damijonas of this as well?{nl}He would be protecting the stele that got destroyed last time.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009717	The demon's plan has been foiled all thanks to you.{nl}We might have crossed the point of no return forever.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009718	Oh, good. {nl}So, have you found something about Albinas?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009719	My word, all this was Vagia's trickery?{nl}Thank the goddesses we didn't fall for it...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009720	There must be someone else who have fallen for a trick like this other than us.{nl}These demons are not just using brute force but also the cunning plans to divide us internally..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009721	Althought the first one was a lucky accident but thank you for all you have done.{nl}May goddesses be with you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009722	After you have destroyed the stele, Damijonas is guarding it even more attentively.{nl}I don't see any chance that it could ever get destroyed again?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009723	It gives me chills every time I think about it.{nl}A demon living among us.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009724	Albinas is gone! What has happened?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009725	We have no choice. {nl}It's far too wide and there are so many things here that look like a monocle. We should split up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009726	You check the Bingcoolers Path area.{nl}Who know? {nl}Demons might have something special.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009727	It really angers me.{nl}Demons do not deserve any mercy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009728	Is that so? My side also had demons only nothing else.{nl}That's strange. There must be something here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009729	Let's check the other side..
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009730	Wait!{nl}I can see the great energy coming from Leima Small Square.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009731	Look at that.. It must be something gigantic. {nl}Come on, go and have a look.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009732	I'm not much of a combat-type person, so, I will just stay hidden here.{nl}What am I going to do when demons show up, ay?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009733	Huh? Outsiders.. Who are you?{nl}How did you get pass all the guards?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009734	Are you, perhaps, seeking the secret behind Ruklys?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009735	Speak honestly otherwise face the consequence.{nl}This old body, you might not sense it yet, is full of holy energy.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009736	You can't miss it, really. The sheer size stands out.{nl}Promise me that you won't keep it to yourself when you find it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009737	Yes! A revelation..{nl}Only the Revelators know the existence of Revelation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009738	I am the keeper of the Fortress of the Land.{nl}Perhaps, you are the one for whom I have been waiting.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009739	I am well aware of the fact that Ruklys has hidden the Revelation in this place.{nl}If you too are looking for it, I will gladly help.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009741	Oh my, how silly of me.{nl}I have forgotten about the devices I have laid around here to keep intruders away.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009742	To make a certificate, we first need a mushroom.{nl}There are many mushrooms at the Sunken Path, so please get me one.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009744	Unfortunately, my body is not what it used to be.{nl}Wielding magic might overwhelm my withered body.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009745	Do not despair! The monsters in the fortress possess energy that might serve as a substitute for my weak magic.{nl}Please, gather it for me. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009746	The monsters that have been residing in this area for some time are bound to have Earth Crystals on them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009747	It's not like the olden days.{nl}Reckless usage of magic.. will take its toll on my olden body.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009748	A certicate is just a fancy word. The principle behind it is quite simple.{nl}What matters the most is ingredients and how you mix them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009749	The process will not take long. {nl}Please, wait for a moment.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009750	Now, Storage Quarter will be accessible.{nl}Clues to find the revelation must be there.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009753	It's dangerous to go alone, take this.{nl}Now my devices will not attack you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009754	For all my life, I have been guarding this place but my struggle bore no fruit on where the revelation lies.{nl}However, if we could consult with the spirit who has lived the era when Ruklys walked, we might get some answer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009755	The thing on my side is devised to read the memory of the spirits.{nl}I made it myself. I have done this before.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009756	No remorse for revolting.{nl}Restrain token will calm them down.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009757	The spirits are left with nothing but rage.{nl}Guilt is no where to be felt.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009758	This Rajatad's Egg has the power to restrain the spirits.{nl}What we need to do is to actualize it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009759	Nothing works better than to use Demon Bone.{nl}Get me the bone and I will extract the power and inject it into the bone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009760	Good, good. I will make an orb.{nl}One final step remains before the Restraint Token.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009761	They say they destroyed something on Ruklys' command.{nl}I suspect, that something might be related to the revelation of goddess.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009762	We must find out what was the device that Rukylis destroyed.{nl}Thanks to you, I now can reach see deeper in their memories.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009763	Deeper I go, stronger they will resist.{nl}When that happens, subdue them with your strength and use the token.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009764	Fill this orb with the life force of the monsters.{nl}That will complete the whole process of restraining and actualizing the energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009765	Knowing how to operate it is different from being able to actually operate it.{nl}Those spirits took the secret to their graves and beyond.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009767	The revelation you are looking for.. {nl}It should not fall into the demon hands, should it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009768	You have promised the Eminent to meet up here, right?{nl}Let's check the monocle before he comes.{nl}Talk to me again, if you are ready.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009769	AH!{nl}The scroll, now I remember.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009770	Remember this? {nl}It is the defense magic scroll that was hidden inside the treasure chest on the secret location.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009771	The scroll contains instructions on hhow to operate the defensive magic field that can fend off demons and how to repair it.{nl}I hope this can foil the Eminent's plan.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009772	Firstly, you need to follow the Eminent's orders to distract him.{nl}At the same time, you and I will activate the magic field secretly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009773	How did it go?{nl}The remaining foundation stone is located near the Ikveta Podium.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009774	However, demon totems are suppressing the power of foundation stone.{nl}I tried to get close to it but there are demons, you see.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009775	Ah, keep in mind that the Eminent might get suspicious if you take too much time.{nl}As soon as the foundation stone gets activated, you need to get back to the Eminent.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009776	No need to keep it secret anymore.{nl}Let me introduce myself properly. I am the Premier Eminent who served King Kadumel 600 years ago.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009777	I thoroughly understand your disbelief.{nl}But please, do allow me to explain.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009778	He along with the demons massacred the Royal army mercilessly.{nl}My army and I came here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009779	It was a long and arduous battle. {nl}But the goddess favored me and victory we saw.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009780	The divine voice of the goddess laid upon me at the victorious moment. {nl}She appointed me to protect the revelation instead of that treacherous Ruklys.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009781	After a long wait, you finally came.{nl}The prophecy spoke no falsehood and you brought me here. The place where the revelation was hidden.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009782	Enough with the apology, let us resume our quest to find the revelation.{nl}The spirits told me that there is a device that bridges the battlegrounds to the revelation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009783	I now know what the device was for, all thanks to you.{nl}I will meet you on the fortress battlegrounds, for I need to prepare something.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009784	Ah, you were still here?{nl}What good news. Lend me your hand.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009785	This is a page from the journal written by the Ruklys' army! {nl}I am quite certain there are more pages.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009786	If you find them, please, do give them to me.{nl}Wilhelmina Carriot will be happy to see this.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009787	If you find them, please, do give them to me.{nl}Wilhelmina Carriot will be happy to see this.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009788	Thanks heavens, you are still alive.{nl}Remember the time when I look around it through the monocle?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009789	I thought the object contained some special power but only demons were there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009790	And when we arrived at the living quarter, I checked the area with the monocle again.{nl}I sensed some great energy. Remember that as well?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009791	At the time, you said only an old manager was there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009792	That old manager.. I don't know what is going on.{nl}You heard him right? He said he is the Premier Eminent who should have died 600 years ago!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009793	The whole shnenigen of making the certificate.{nl}What did he say?"Overwhelm my withered body", my behind!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009794	There are many old mages and clerics. What about them, eh?{nl}He only said those things to cover something up!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009795	Something was not well with the spirits, also! {nl}Why would they be so enraged against him, if he was a good man?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009796	I do sense something foul is going on.{nl}There must be something we are not seeing straight.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009797	I pray I am wrong.{nl}It is best if you return to the man called the Eminent. It's no good if he suspects you. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009798	Please, be careful.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009799	Are you telling me that he was with the demons?{nl}And they were not attacking him at all?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009800	That trully is suspicious. {nl}What I said earlier was a mere conjecture but.. we should see it for ourselves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009801	That man calling himself the Eminent, I will meet him with you. {nl}His true identity will be revealed through this monocle.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009802	Oh, you came.{nl}Let us trace back the memory of the spirits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009803	They destroyed the device on Ruklys' command. {nl}So, that must mean if we repair it, it will lead us to the revelation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009804	I know where the device is but in order to repair it, we need the parts. {nl}We could get the cogs from the traps he made.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009805	I will search the Paramiso Battle Field, you take the Ataka Side Road.{nl}Get everything you can lay your hands on.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009806	Ah, please, do not, under no circumstance, disturb the defensive magic field.{nl}One false move and we are dead. We are all dead.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009807	The parts are needed to revive the device.{nl}Please, find them from the traps set up in the area near Ataka Side Road.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009808	The Savior who followed all the way here by having faith in the revelation.{nl}You're gradually getting closer to the truth.{nl}Savior, what does the Divine Tree mean to human beings?{nl}A symbol of calamity, the roots of everyone's sorrow in this land...{nl}No. That's the image created by the crooked hearts of the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009809	In the beginning... there was God.{nl}A sky with dancing stars, land to support that sky...{nl}It was all created together with humans and other lives.{nl}And thus the world was created. {nl}The God who painted the world with radiance had fallen to an eternal dream.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009810	The Divine Tree. It is another form that God has taken for himself.{nl}The God had turned into a tree that will breathe life out to the world, making the world complete.{nl}We are beings that are born to groom the world and the Divine Tree.{nl}The God has asked us not to wake him up from his slumber.{nl}Thus, we lived side by side in the new peaceful age.{nl}However, there began a feeling of thirst within the hearts of some.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009811	The fact that God is not by us.{nl}The moment that people realized the abscence of God was the source of their thirst,{nl}we could no longer live together. {nl}In the end, the thirst that has craved for God had grown into obsession for awakening the God.{nl}They threw away the name that God had given them to call themselves demons.{nl}The obsessions... It has brought calamity upon this world. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009812	In order to be loved... They had decided they needed to disobey God's words and awaken him.{nl}Savior, you are the one that will take God's revelation and save this world from the demons,{nl}and truly make this world complete by completing his will. {nl}The time is nigh.{nl}I will be waiting for you in the cruel place that the tyrant has carved out.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009813	Good thing he doesn't seem to find anything suspicious. {nl}We must not give any parts to Eminent until the magic field of Ruklys is activated.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009814	I took a look at the location of the foudation stone on the scroll.{nl}The magic field only gets properly activated with this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009815	First, the foundation stone under Slypti Watchtower.{nl}The writings on the pole were erased so the magic field is not working.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009816	It will work when you write on it again. {nl}I'll take care of the magic field below so I'll leave this to you. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009817	Ah, I almost forgot.{nl}The scroll says that anything with magic would suffice.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009818	I think demon blood would work.{nl}Let's try it out.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009819	Be sure not to be caught by Eminent. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009820	The harrowing place forged by a tyrant you speak of might mean... {nl}The prison made in the Kadumel dynasty. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009821	All I know is it's Kalejimas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009822	Thanks. But our townspeople usually stay away from the outsiders.{nl}It is a rare sight to see them asking an outsider for a favor.{nl}If you are thinking of going to my town, turn away now.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009823	On your way here, you have met a girl and a demon that was chasing her?{nl}Never let a Revelator meet up with the girl...{nl}Not all that jolly.. but it seems it's none of your business, don't you think so?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009824	I beg your pardon? You are the Revelator?{nl}That must mean you also had that a horrible nightmare as well.{nl}...Perhaps you are the outsider the legend talks about.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009825	In our town, we have this legend told by Goddess Goddess Laima.{nl}When the town is in danger, worry not, there will come a stranger with the light divine{nl}Evil shall fall by the might of the light. {nl}It is no time to be standing here. I must go to town and see what's going on.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009826	Ah..about the food.. We do need to get back the food ferrets stole..{nl}The water in the forest turned red and the fruits have become unusually enlarged since Medzio Diena.{nl}The water and the fruits somehow are all poisoned.{nl}Food is scare around here. Those darn ferrets steal our food.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009827	Revelator. This town is having a food crisis.{nl}Please, use this anti-ferret paralysis powder to retrieve the food they stole.{nl}I will head back to town and ask more about the legend.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009828	Ah, is that you whom Leja talked about?{nl}The town cleric says you have brought light into this village.{nl}Ye finally came. After all these years. The stranger to rescue.{nl}O! Praise be unto Goddess Laima... Our hearts sing prayers in full to you. You have not forsakened us..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009829	What could that be? Ha! You actually managed to get the food back from the ferrets!{nl}You are truly the one to save our town. My deepest gratitude.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009830	Leja went to Laimadon. Saying that Goddess Laima must have left something for us in the giant statue of her.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009831	According to the legend told. This town was formerly a town that worshiped Goddess Laima in Goddess Laimadon.{nl}Long ago, Goddess Laima went on a pilgrimage after foreseeing the terrible future. {nl}Goddess Laima cared deeply about the townspeople and asked Goddess Lada to look after us when she is gone.{nl}And if a great threat, even greater than the power of Goddess Lada, a stranger chasing a nightmore will arrive{nl}along with the light and save the town.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009832	Not long after her disappearance, Medzio Diena happened... It was the future Laima has predicted...{nl}The river turned red and poisonous and it tainted the fruits as well.{nl}While this was going on the demon started to invade.. They were after Goddess Lada and we failed to protect her.{nl}The demons responsible for kidnapping the goddess made the peaceful ferrets very ferocious.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009833	The ferocious ferrets are constantly invading our town and taking our food.{nl}In the ferret hideout, you will find the totem planted by the demons. We suspect it is responsible for the ferret's recent change of behavior.{nl}Would you be willing to destroy the totem in the ferret's hideout for us?{nl}Without the ferret problem, our town would have no further trouble.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009834	And one more thing, if that totem is as important as we think it is, the demons will not stand idly by.{nl}Be careful...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009835	You have destroyed the Demon Totem! Words cannot express how grateful, we are.{nl}As for my ferrets, I will send my grandson to check up on them.{nl}You have something else to do.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009836	A mysterious girl came into our town while you were busy destroying the totem.{nl}She silently passed through the town to Laimadon.{nl}Our forefathers told us that when Laima the Goddess pays her visit to the town, the soft warmth stays on the town.{nl}The soft warmth we all felt when the mysterious girl was passing through..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009837	She too must have been the one sent by Goddess Laima just like you are.{nl}Follow that girl, if you are the one foretold by the legend, you will be able to find her trace.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009838	Please, save our town and Goddess Lada.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009839	Oh drat! Bad new. While away to get the juice, the ferrets came again and took more food!{nl}We need a permanent solution.{nl}Perhaps, this time just giving them the food would be better. Of course, I don't mean that we should give up the fight.{nl}We give them the food and teach them a lesson of not taking something that is not yours.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009840	It's a simple plan. We'll find the food that the ferrets stole, and season them a bit.{nl}With Corrupted Red Water.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009841	We will not take this anymore.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009842	That should be enough to poison the food. Good work.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009843	Now, the ferrets tend to stick the stolen food inside fruit basket.{nl}Go to the ferret's hideout and season the stolen food with the crimson water.{nl}What matters the most is to poison the fresh ones.{nl}The ferrets are stupid and lazy and prone to let food rot because they forgot.{nl}It's no use if they think they just got sick from bad food. Only the fresh ones will do the trick.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009844	I mean, really, they let so much food go to waste because they forgot {nl}and eventually they let it rot and then they come back to steal again.{nl}I mean, we pay for their stupidity.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009845	How does the phrase go? One step back, two steps forward?{nl}Bon appetit, ferrets!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009846	Ah Revelator. Thank you so much for destroying the demon totem.{nl}Unfortunately, grandfather told me to look whether the ferrets have become tame,{nl}but they are still as ferocious as ever. {nl}Could it be that the effect from the totem lingers?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009847	That got me thinking. Demons used a totem as a means of influence, right?{nl}How about we build something similar to counter-act the effect?{nl}Could you ask Widas whether my guess is feasible or not? {nl}Dievdirbys Widas is the best Dievdirbys in town.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009848	A statue to counter-act the demon influences, eh?{nl}Hmm let's see...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009849	The ferrets I grew up with were quite a friendly and kind bunch. {nl}When I got lost, they were kind enough to take me back to town.{nl}What could have made them like that?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009850	I, too, got a similar idea when I heard that a totem is influencing the ferrets to be ferocious.{nl}So, I experimented on creating a statue that has a reverse effect...{nl}It's still in an experiemental stage but with the totem gone, it's a fine time to try it out...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009851	Here, this is the statue I made...{nl}After you place it, please, stick around a bit to see how they react...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009852	Back in the good ol' days, I used to make ferret statues while observing them...{nl}But now, even an eye contact with them provokes them to attack..{nl}I hope, this statue will bring peace to both humans and the ferrets...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009853	What? It only provoked the ferrets even more...?{nl}Oh dear, is that a failure...?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009854	Ah... It is too early to despair... {nl}The lingering demon influence might be interfering with this positive effect...{nl}I cannot do this alone. {nl}I need to consult this with Druid Benes of Laimadon, an expert on ferrets...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009855	Ah, Revelator! You came earlier than I expected.{nl}I tried to go to the giant statue but the ferrets made it very difficult...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009856	Huh? The mysterious girl might be the chosen leader sent by Goddess Laima?{nl}The girl ran that way right before you came...{nl}The ferrets were chasing after her so I did find it quite odd...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009857	Revelator, there is no time! The girl went that way.{nl}The ferrets are on a hunt for her.{nl}Defeat the ferrets, if you have to. Just the girl. Please, hurry.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009858	I pray for her safety...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009859	...The girl has been kidnapped? That's terrible...{nl}Demon Lord Zaura must be behind this! {nl}He is responsible for kidnapping Goddess Lada as well.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009860	Be careful when gathering Drowsy Herb.{nl}One false move and the spore explodes and, believe me, it WILL make you drowsy.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009861	Were the ferrets present when Zaura was kidnapping her?{nl}I saw ferrets carrying a huge bag.{nl}I suspect it was her inside. I mean, ferrets don't usually.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009862	If the ferrets did take her away, they are guarding her as well.{nl}If you go straight down, there is drowsy herb.{nl}Bring it to me and I will make an incense that will make them very drowsy.{nl}While they are passed out, the rescue would be very easy.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009863	One, two, three...{nl}Yep, that seems to be enough.{nl}Wait a moment, please.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009864	Don't worry about getting drowsy yourself.{nl}It is specifically designed to affect only the ferrets.{nl}The paralysis powder is my invention also.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009865	The drowsy scent is complete! {nl}Set a campfire and put it in the fire and nearby ferrets {nl}will be drowsier than a night of heavey feast.{nl}I will mark the spots to which I suspect they might have taken her.{nl}If you find the girl, quickly burn the scent.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009866	There... Tree... Under... The goddess...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009867	Goddess' Orb
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009868	Revelator... I am Laima, the goddess of fate.{nl}You have done well following the girl who is a living embodiment of my will.{nl}In this forest, my sister Lada is imprisoned by the cruel Demon Lord Zaura.{nl}Zaura is constructing an abominable object called 'Kruvina'. {nl}It is made from the life force drained from Lada.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009869	Revelator... Please, save my sister, Goddess Lada. {nl}Goddess Lada is being held captive in the Seir Rainforest.{nl}And I beseech thee to take this orb with you. It will prove itself useful on your journey.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009870	The Ferret Transformation Scroll is complete. {nl}When you use it, you can transform you into a ferret.{nl}Worry not, it is based on careful observation of ferrets. You will look very natural.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009871	You will most likely be able to converse naturally with the ferret tribe. {nl}Talk to the ferret tribe and ask about why they are aligning with the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009872	Be careful not to transform back to your original state. {nl}They will attack you all at once. The sheer number will overwhelm even you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009873	Is that so? Are you telling me the ferrets are helping the demons on their free will?{nl}No, that's impossible! I cannot believe it...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009874	Did the ferrets really say that? Ah, of course, you have no reason to lie..{nl}Forgive me for my rudeness but this is very unbelieveable...{nl}Or could it be possible that they have been brainwashed so {nl}fundamentally that they don't even realize they are being brainwashed?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009875	A further experimentation is in order. {nl}This is a block of wood that I have changed its shape via my magic.{nl}This wooden block is in the shape of an injured man. Let's set it up it around the ferrets.{nl}I mean, even if the ferrets are attacking people on their own accord, they would not go as far as{nl}attacking an injured man, would they? Assuming they are in their right minds.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009876	If the ferrets attack it, that would be the ultimate proof {nl}that they are still under the control of the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009877	They attacked it, you say? I knew it, they are indeed mind controlled!{nl}I guess, that's something...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009878	Let us not rejoice so soon yet...{nl}The fact that they are attacking even an injured man {nl}means that their brutal behaviour is still on.{nl}They are still very dangerous..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009879	We'll have to expel the ferrets since we can't do anything else about them at the moment.{nl}I have an incense that ferrets hate.{nl}The ferrets will most likely run away if you burn the awful incense at a campfire.{nl}It is a tad pungent for people as well... So I hope that you'll be able to cope...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009880	I will make more of these.{nl}There has to be enough for everyone in town.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009881	Thank you so much. Without you, you enlightened us about the ferrets.{nl}The mind control will one day wear off, won't it?{nl}Until then, we will be working on a way to make them calm.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009882	Goddess Lada
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009883	My heart is filled with gratitude.{nl}From you, I sense the power of my sister, Laima...{nl}I worry for her safety...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009884	The Demon Lord Zaura is trying to form a powerful {nl}crystal known as Kruvina by using my life force.{nl}The Kruvina is usually made with the life force of those human sacrifices. {nl}It has the power to enlarge plants.{nl}The demons have a plan to wipe out humanity through these enlarged plants.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009885	The water in the forest turned red and the unnatural growth of both trees {nl}and their fruits are all due to the Kruvina made from human life forces.{nl}The demons like the power of the Kruvina so much {nl}that they wanted to make even more powerful Kruvina.{nl}They attempted to drain the life force from a goddess.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009886	The Kruvina is an entity that should not exist in this world. It must be destroyed.{nl}This very moment is the golden opportunity! {nl}While Demon Lord Zaura is away treating his fatal wound!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009887	The Kruvina here is unstable since it used my life force little by little.{nl}However, something made of a goddess' life force is not easy to destroy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009888	From you I can feel the power of Laima. Have you brought the orb of Laima? If so, {nl}the process is easy. Use the orb to neutralize the Kruvina. But the power is slightly lacking... {nl}That comes later. Right now, destroying the device that is restraining me and the machine {nl}that is creating Kruvina is the first thing you should do. After that, I will breathe my powers into {nl}the orb. I cannot promise you much for I have little power left in me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009889	Well done. The creation of the Kruvina has been halted. It will not grow anymore.{nl}Thank you for your service.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009890	This is not the end. No matter how imperfect the Kruvina is.{nl}Even in its imperfect state, the Kruvina is a far too dangerous thing to exist.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009891	Now, I will breathe most of the power I have left in me into this orb.{nl}The power of a goddess will grant even a human like you the strength to destroy the Kruvina.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009892	Now, my power unto your orb.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009893	Demon Lord Zaura will not stand idly by while you are destroying it...{nl}Please, take care of yourself...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009894	An interference from the Beholder... That was quite unexpected..{nl}But, it matters not... Revelator... It's not your fault at all.{nl}If you have not foiled the demon's plan, the Kruvina would have been completed.{nl}Stopping its creation itself is worthy of great praise.{nl}My dear sister, Laima, would have seen the Beholder's interference well in advance.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009895	Thank you for saving me, Revelator.{nl}You did a great job on putting an end to the demon's plan.{nl}As for I, stabilizing the forest along with the townspeople is my duty.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009896	Right before the self-imposed wandering, she told me something.{nl}She said, there will be a disaster, even she could not prevent...{nl}When that time comes, lead a stranger with her orb to the hand of the giant Goddess Statue.{nl}Take the orb of Laima and go to the hand of the giant statue.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009897	I worry about my other sisters...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009898	Ah... No, it can't be...{nl}Laima is being held captive by Giltine...{nl}Savior... Please, stop Giltine and her evil plan and save Laima...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009899	I will call out to my sisters after the situation at this {nl}place gets stabilized and return to my full power...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009900	The legend was true!{nl}You actually manage to defeat the demon and save Goddess Lada. {nl}You truly are what Goddess Laima told us about. Thank you!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009901	There used to be a temple for worshiping the goddess. It got tuppled off by the demons.{nl}I am waiting for Goddess Lada and Laima to return and {nl}trying to rebuild the temple with the help of the townspeople.{nl}However, there are still some demon remnants.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009902	So, here's what I want to ask you to do. Help us mop up the demon remnants.{nl}With your help, we could drive them off much quickly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009903	I don't understand why the demons still stick around even after their Demon Lord has fallen. {nl}What's the point?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009904	Thank you. The number of demons has significantly decreased!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009905	We must find a way to purify the corrupted land. But I do not know how.{nl}Even Dievdirbys Widas could not come up with any plan for purifying the land.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009906	Say, wouldn't one of the masters in Orsha know a way to purify the land?{nl}I would ask them myself but I am tied up at the moment...{nl}Will you please visit the masters in Orsha and see if they have any ideas?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009907	Orsha Master
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009908	Ah... You are looking for a way to purify the land?{nl}How could I say no to that face.{nl}I will get you Purification Scroll.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009909	There must be a master in Orsha who knows a way to purify the land!{nl}There must be...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009910	Woah! A Purification Scroll?{nl}That's perfect! Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009911	While you, the Revelator, was away in Orsha, I looked around.{nl}The demon totems erected throughout the land are corrupting the land.{nl}The demons are guarding them, so couldn't approach them...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009912	Could I ask you to destroy the totems and use the Purification Scroll on the corrupted spot?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009913	I wonder how strong the evil energy is... seeing even the ferrets have been affected by it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009914	Oh thank you so much! I really needed your help!{nl}When the temple is built, please do come and visit me!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009915	We were just about to lose all hope for our town...{nl}You truly are a savior... I cannot thank you enough!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009916	It is time for us to rebuild the temple altogether.{nl}I searched for the right place and found a perfect spot up there. It's rich with life force.{nl}Demons approached me so I did not have much time to inspect it more carefully. It matters not,{nl}I do believe that Goddess Lada will recover her strength faster, if she rests in that place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009917	I shall give you Earth's Flower Seed.{nl}This flower takes the energy of the soil to grow. {nl}Inside the flower, the life force gathers. When the flower with rich life force blossoms!{nl}Please, take it to Goddess Lada.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009918	I have never felt such a great amount of life force... {nl}A temple with hot springs would be very prof...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009919	...Hmm?{nl}Ah, nevermind what I just said, I was just talking to myself. {nl}It was nothing, really. Forget about it...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009920	Goddess Lada
QUEST_LV_0100_20151016_009921	Even if it happened in accordance with Laima's prophecy, {nl}I have fallen and left the townspeople helpless and worried...{nl}My gratitude cannot be expressed through mere words... {nl}And this flower is filled with great life force...{nl}My recovery won't take long with this. Again, I deeply thank you...

QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010430	If it were anyone else, I would have stopped you but to you, words of warning will only fall flat.{nl}Not sure if it is bravery or recklessness...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010431	I need to rest here a bit.{nl}I exhausted all my strength running away. {nl}Stay any longer with you, my dear life won't stay any longer.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010432	I don't know about the identity of the light bead.{nl}However, it does not have that same feeling the demon-produceds have.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010433	Owl Chief
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010434	Thank you. Really, thank you.{nl}If I got under the influence of the demons,{nl}I shudder to think what would have happened to the poor souls...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010435	The light bead you just saw is a human soul.{nl}Very pure souls. They were killed by the invading demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010436	The Owl Sculptures used to lead those souls to the right path.{nl}But the demons corrupted the forest and controlled us.{nl}At the moment, my comrades under the demon control {nl}are leading those poor souls accordance with the demon control.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010438	Oh, the goddess must be praised! She has sent you!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010439	If the Mind Control Tower gets destroyed, the impact might affect my comrades as well.{nl}So, before destroying the tower, gather up the energy of the forest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010440	Restore the Karolis Altar and the energy of the forest will be restored as well.{nl}I will give you the Guide Owl's Will.{nl}It will direct you to the ruined Karolis Altar.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010441	The Karolis Altar used to collect the energy of the forest.{nl}Ever since, it was destroyed, the energy of the forest got significantly weakened.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010442	The Altar of the Forest is still strong and functional,{nl}but we need Karolis' Light to spread the power all over the forest.{nl}The weakened light is the cause of the energy not spreading far.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010443	The comrades will revert back to their right minds, {nl}if the Karolis' Altar and that of the forest is restored.{nl}We, Owl Sculptures, live alongside the rest of the forest.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010444	I've been waiting for you.{nl}I knew you succeeded since the energy of the forest was increased.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010445	I had my hopes up but it seems the Karolis Altar is not enough {nl}to restore the energy of the forest fully.{nl}The energy from the altar of the forest needs to be spread as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010446	The altar of the forest is the pond across the pond.{nl}If you get there, Karolis' Light will be spreading the energy of the altar to the entire forest.{nl}The near-extinguished light needs to be re-ignited and {nl}then the energy will spread out to the every corner of the forest.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010447	There are four places where Karolis' Light is.{nl}Each lasts for a short time, but if you manage to light all four of them, they sustain each other.{nl}Be quick and nimble when lighting all four of them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010448	Back in the old days, there were several altars but now only one stands.{nl}The demons indeed ruined our forest.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010449	The energy from the altar is successfully spread.{nl}All the other owls are no long under control.{nl}The only thing left is to destroy the Mind Control Tower and the security of this area is ensured.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010450	The Mind Control Tower is charged with great evil energy. Touching it directly will put {nl}even you in danger. My Owl Sculpture comrades have regained their senses, {nl}although minute, we will lend you our strength. Not yet complete but together, {nl}it will be enough to fight against the evil energy from the Mind Control Tower.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010451	Speak to the Owl Sculptures, you have met along the way here.{nl}They want to thank the one who saved them.{nl}They will lend you their power.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010452	Please, come back to me after gathering power from all the Owl Sculptures.{nl}I will combine their power into one.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010453	I hope, none of my comrades said anything that might offend you.{nl}They are all very grateful for what you've done for us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010454	Now, I have added my power to the pile of power. I will make them into one.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010455	I had some doubt but fortunately, when combined the power is stronger than I expected.{nl}This will help you destroying the Mind Control Tower.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010456	I am truly sorry that all we could repay you so little {nl}for the tremendous service you've done for us.{nl}But I do have the feeling that goddess will be leading you from somewhere.{nl}Somehow, I have that feeling.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010457	There is an Owl Sculpture a bit far from here. It's not responding yet.{nl}I am a bit worried...{nl}But we have important business to finish first.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010458	You've destroyed the Mind Control Tower as well?{nl}Now, peace will return to Karolis Springs after all.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010459	Mardas came to speak to with you.{nl}He has witnessed quite a lot of demon atrocities.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010460	It seems that Letas Stream is under the demon reign.{nl}Could you lend us your strength a little longer?{nl}You are our only hope.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010461	We could find the solution if Mardas and I combine what we know and have seen.{nl}We will come up with the way to fend off the demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010462	Firstly, we need Romuva of Suppression which is infused with the divine power of the forest.{nl}Guide Owl Sculpture in Letas Stream will be able to make you one.{nl}But it is not responding to my will, that means it is still under the demon control.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010463	Please, find the Guide Owl Sculpture in Letas Stream.{nl}Save it and tell it I sent you and you need Romuva of Suppression.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010464	To the north of Karolis Springs, you will come across the spot high in the energy of the forest.{nl}There you will find the energy of Karolis Springs.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010465	Approach the Energy of Karolist Springs, they will approach you back.{nl}When there are enough, they will create the crystalized essence of Karolis Springs. {nl}Take it to the Guide Owl Sculpture.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010466	Oh, the horror of horrors, Mardas have witnessed.{nl}We must not let it continue.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010467	{nl}O those poor souls... Countless would be the number of souls we have given to the demons.{nl}It truly breaks my heart.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010468	Guide Owl Sculpture
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010469	Ugh... What happened... Who are you?{nl}Did you save me?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010470	The Owl Chief Sculpture sent you?{nl}Romuva of Suppression... the crisis must be overwhelmingly big, if that is needed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010471	Romuva of Suppression is not something one should make lightly,{nl}but the desparate situation calls for a desparate measure. {nl}For the good of all, I will make you one. In order to make one,  Letas' Sacred Branch is needed.{nl}It's a branch from Letas' Sacred Tree. But for that, the energy of the forest is needed...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010472	Ah, that is the one left, is that so?{nl}Alright. Go to the northern empty place of Letas Stream, sprinkle the crystalised essence there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010473	The holy tree is not easy to find straightaway.{nl}Keep sprinkling the essence until the tree show itself.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010474	Letas' Sacred Tree is something like a manifested will of the forest.{nl}Before the demon invasion, the tree could be easily seen but now, completely gone.{nl}But it will show itself again when it senses the energy of the forest.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010475	Have you found Letas' Sacred Tree?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010476	I feared if the holy tree would not appear even in the presence of the energy. {nl}I am glad I was wrong. I suspect you are the special one.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010477	The demons weakened Letas' Sacred Branch.{nl}It needs to be revigorated.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010478	Purify the evil energy monsters have and feed it to the branch.{nl}Use the branch on the monsters to follow the aforementioned procedure.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010479	Weak monsters do not stand a chance against the sacred branch.{nl}The holy power burns through the darkness.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010480	It highly trusts you for it is the Owl Chief Sculpture is the one who sent you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010481	Is the power stored in the branch enough?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010482	Now, I will get you Romuva of Suppression.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010483	Romuva of Suppression is ready but... I fear it will not be enough.{nl}I do not know what the Owl Chief Sculpture is think, really.{nl}I am powerless, myself. So, I cannot help you on that.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010484	A person called Mardas would come up with the solution?{nl}What are you waiting for then? Go talk to him.{nl}Perhaps, he is already here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010485	We are grateful for Mardas helping us but what happened to him is a real tragedy.{nl}We, the Owl Sculptures, de facto carried out the demon's plan. We certainly feel great guilt.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010486	You are just in time!{nl}So, did you get Romuva of Suppression?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010487	By talking with the Owl Chief Sculpture, I got the feeling we could work this out.{nl}The demons are using the evil energy to corrupt Letas Stream. {nl}And extracting that energy to trap souls.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010488	Soul Starvation must be destroyed but the evil energy is far too thick and it is protected by the magic circle.{nl}Firstly, eliminate the evil energy first.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010489	The evil energy is being generated from the center of the forest. You can get to it by following the right path.{nl}Set up Romuva of Suppression near it, it will suppress to the holy energy.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010490	It breaks my heart to think about the folks back home but I am powerless at the moment. All I can do now is to help you. It is small consolation I can feel.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010491	The evil energy is still coming up, you say?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010492	The corruption is much more severe than I thought.{nl}We must make haste and eliminate Black Smoke extracting the energy of the forest.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010493	Without Black Smoke, the demon structures will be weakened.{nl}However, from what I have seen. There are Eyes of Surveillance installed. That might make it difficult to approach it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010494	It might be near-impossible but you need to infiltrate the place by avoiding the surveillance sphere set around Eyes of Surveillance.{nl}At the end of the road filled with Eyes of Surveillance, there are magic circles.{nl}Destroy the magic circles to destroy the Eyes of Surveillance.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010495	Take care of Eyes of Surveillance. Then, use the Romuva of Suppression to eliminate Black Smoke.{nl}It's very dangerous so please be careful.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010496	The Owl Chief Sculpture sure knew a lot.{nl}It must have spent its entire life in this forest but how did it get such deep and broad knowledge?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010497	Good work.{nl}Are you hurt?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010498	Now, Soul Starvation is destructible.{nl}There must be magic circles around it but they can be easily disabled.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010499	There is a specific order by which you need to disable the magic circles.{nl}Even if you fail, do not fear. You can try again and you will find that order.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010500	The demons might be getting suspicious. After all, the evil energy and Black Smoke are gone.{nl}You must hurry.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010501	If the souls are set free, perhaps, this sorrow and rage I feel might go away.{nl}I cannot be too sure about it at the moment.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010502	Is that so. All the souls are set free.{nl}The Owl Chief Sculpture says that those souls would be lead by the owls well again.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010503	It would be better to give Romuva of Suppression to Guide Owl Sculpture.{nl}It will help other owl sculptures regain their powers.{nl}I will deliver the news to the Owl Chief Sculpture.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010504	It is safe to say that Letas Stream is free from the threat of the demons.{nl}I cannot thank you enough.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010505	I do not believe it is no coincidence that you came to us.{nl}I sense the divine will of the goddess guiding you here.{nl}I pray she will continue to guide you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151022_010506	Gratitude fills up my heart.{nl}I apologize for my initial rudeness. I was very confused.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010646	I will give you the Guide Owl's Will to you.{nl}It will guide you to the place where the Karolis Altar used to be.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010647	The Karolis Altar used to pump energy to the forest.{nl}Ever since it was destroyed, the energy of the forest was reduced quite significantly.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010648	The Forest Altar still stands but to spread the energy {nl}throughout the entire forest, it needs Karolis' lights.{nl}The lights went out so did the spreading of the energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010649	If both the Karolis Altar and the Forest Sanctuary are restored. {nl}My comrades will be back to normal. We, the owls, share lives with the forest.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010650	I've been waiting for you.{nl}I knew you succeeded when I sensed the energy of the forest strengthened.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010651	I should not have held my hopes to high up... {nl}The restored Karolis Altar was not enough to completely revive the forest.{nl}The Altar of the Forest needs to be revived as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010652	Ah, the Altar of the Forest is located near the pond across there.{nl}It spreads Karolis' lights throughout the forest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010653	The lights are almost all out...{nl}If you can illuminate them the power of the altar will spread out.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010654	There are four Karolis' lights.{nl}Illuminating only one light will lose its light quickly,{nl}but illuminating all four will maintain the altar's power.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010655	Be sure to illuminate them all before they give out.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010656	Back in the yesteryears, there were numerous altars but now, there is only one.{nl}The demons did indeed ruin the forest and us.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010657	You did it! You spread the energy around.{nl}It seems that all the other owls are now back to normal.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010658	Now, the only thing left to do is to destroy that mind-altering abomination. {nl}Our safety is now guaranteed.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010659	The tower is filled with very malicous energy.{nl}Even you cannot touch it without any precaution.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010660	The rest of the owls have regained themselves. And they are eager to lend you their power.{nl}Small individually but when collected, strong enough {nl}to fend off the malicious force the tower contains.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010661	Speak with the owls you have come across on the way here.{nl}And they do want to thank you personally.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010662	Explain the situation to them and they will surely lend their power.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010663	After getting the powers from all the owls, come back to me.{nl}I will combine them together.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010664	Did any of the owls mention something rude?{nl}They all are deeply grateful for what you have done.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010665	Now, I will combine their powers along with mine and make them into one.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010666	I was fearful of our combined power not being strong enough...{nl}I am glad to be wrong. It is certainly strong.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010667	Now, use this power to blow the tower to the smithereens!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010668	I am sorry for not being able to repay you for all that you've done for us.{nl}However, what I can say for sure is that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010669	You certainly are being lead by the goddess...{nl}I have that feeling.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010670	Actually, there is one owl a bit far from here...{nl}It's not responding.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010671	I am worried about that child but..{nl}The crisis on our hand requires our full attention.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010672	The wretched demon tower has fallen?{nl}Peace returns at last! {nl}My heart is content.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010673	Someone named Mardas came here to speak to you.{nl}Mardas has been talking about what he saw. The details on what the demons were doing.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010674	I do believe that Letas Stream is under the demon control.{nl}Could we ask you to help us a bit longer?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010675	To us, you are our only hope...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010676	Perhaps if Mardas and I can combine both of our knowledges {nl}on what we know about the demons, we can find a solution.{nl}We will be planning here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010677	First, we need the Namott of Suppression.{nl}It contains a high level of divine energy from the forest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010678	The Guide Owl in near the Letas Stream can make you one.{nl}But seeing how it is not responding to my call. It is still under the demon's control.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010679	Please, find the Guide Owl fast.{nl}When it regains itself, tell it, you need the Namott of Suppression.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010680	On the upper side of Karolis Stream, there is a spot rich with the energy of the forest.{nl}Stand there and the energy will come to you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010681	Higher the energy gathers in one spot, it gets condensed and crystalized.{nl}Take to the Guide Owl.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010682	Mardas has told me about the atrocities demons did. Even from just descriptions, it put a cold spear through my heart.{nl}We cannot allow it to continue.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010683	O, the poor souls... they are the ones whom we handed over the demons... they must be?{nl}I am made of wood but my wooden heart is aching.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010684	The Owl Chief sent you, eh?{nl}The Namott of Suppression... Now that's an extreme measure. The situation must be that dire.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010685	Namott of Suppression is not something to be made lightly...{nl}For all of us, I will try.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010686	The first ingredient we need is Letas' Sacred Branch. It's a branch from Letas' Sacred Tree.{nl}However, the energy of the forest is needed to find Letas' Sacred Tree...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010687	Wha..? You already had it on you?{nl}What good news. Bring it to the northern side of Letas Stream and sprinkle the energy around.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010688	It might not be easy to spot at the first try.{nl}You need to keep spreading the energy around to make the tree to appear.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010689	Letas' Sacred Tree is a physical manifestation of the forest's will.{nl}Before the demon invasion, it was not a rare sight to see but now it is.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010690	However, if the energy of the forest is restored, they will reappear.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010691	How did it go? Did you find the tree?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010692	I wondered what should we do if the tree does not appear even with the energy of the forest.{nl}What a relief! Perhaps, it was no luck but rather you are the special one.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010693	It seems that Letas' Sacred Branch is weakened by the demons.{nl}Its power is insufficient. We need to fill it up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010694	The branch can purify and absorb the malicious force from the monsters.{nl}Use it on monsters to purify their energies and absorb them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010695	The weak ones will not be able to stand the awesome might of the branch.{nl}They will burn like a piece of paper.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010696	You must be very trusted by the Owl Chief. Seeing that the Owl Chief sent you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010697	Is the branch all filled up?{nl}Let me make it into the Namott of Suppression.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010698	The Namott is complete but...{nl}I am not confident it will be enough to combat the demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010699	I, myself, am not sure what the Owl Chief was thinking.{nl}I too have lost most of my power, I cannot help you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010700	There is someone who can help you on your mission?{nl}What are you waiting for go and find out the plan.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010701	Perhaps, you don't have to go after all.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010702	It is a blessing that that Mardas person is helping us out. But the story Mardas told is a very depressing one.{nl}We are in some ways responsible for such atrocity. I feel guilty. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010703	You are just in time.{nl}Did you get the Namott of Suppression?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010704	After talking with the Owl Chief, we might have a plan that can work.{nl}The demons are using the evil energy to corrupt Letas Stream and trap the stolen souls there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010705	A thing called Soul Starvation is keeping the souls locked up. It must be destroyed but..{nl}The evil energy is far too thick and it is protected by the magic circles.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010706	Removing the evil energy corrupting the forest would be first in order.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010707	Follow the right path and go straight to find the center of the forest, you will find the evil energy.{nl}Set up Namott of Suppression around it to remove the evil energy.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010708	When I think about the folks back home, I cannot bear it any longer but..{nl}I am powerless. Helping you is my way of doing 'something at all'.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010709	The evil energy is continuously spawning?{nl}It's more serious than I thought.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010710	We need to fill up the spots where the energy of the forest is getting drained quickly. {nl}The Black Smoke spots.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010711	If we remove Black Smoke, the demon structures will be weakened as well.{nl}But the way to get there is guarded by Surveillance Eyes. So, approaching it will not be a cake walk.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010712	It's rather risky but... I want you to infiltrate the place without getting detected by the surveillance spheres spinning around the Surveillance Eyes.{nl}At the end of the path, there is a magic circle managing those eyes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010713	Without the magic circle, the Surveillance Eyes might go away as well.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010714	Without those pesky eyes, Black Smoke can be easily dealt with by using Namott of Surveillance.{nl}Be careful, it is a near-suicide mission.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010715	The Owl Chief sure did know a lot.{nl}It is wise and knowledgeable even though it never left this place in its entire existence.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010716	Are you hurt?{nl}It must have been a very dangerous journey, I can imagine... I was just standing here feeling powerless.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010717	Now, the Soul Starvation is vulnerable.{nl}The magic circles around it are protecting it but they can be easily disabled.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010718	There is a certain order in disabling protection magic circles.{nl}One false step and you have to start all over again from the beginning.{nl}If you remain focused even in the face of a failure, you will find the order.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010719	The evil energy is weakened and Black Smoke is gone. The demons, if they are not completely stupid, will notice thses changes and come after us.{nl}Please, be haste.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010720	If we manage to set those souls free, will the guilt and sadness I feel can be set free as well?{nl}But what about my rage?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010721	I do not know at the moment...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010722	Is that so... The souls are free now.{nl}The Owl Chief promised to guide the souls to their rightful place, the arms of the goddess.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151102_010723	The Namott of Suppression is best left to the Guide Owl.{nl}It will help the owls regain their power.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011307	Anyway, it's a relief the Revelator was able to stop it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011308	In between this Gorge Area and Klaipeda is the Thorn Forest that is full of evil energy. {nl}It was just a normal and peaceful forest before but...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011309	You making it through the forest... Does it mean the forest is now purified?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011310	There is still so much left undiscovered about the Great King Zachariel.{nl}But since the demons live longer than us... This must have been what they were preying at. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011311	I don't know who it is but it's a good thing the Revelator stopped it. {nl}We might even have had another Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011312	Now the demons even bear the face of a human. {nl}I heard some Revelator stopped the Demon Lord in the Royal Mausoleum,{nl}but I wonder how many demons are now hiding amongst humans. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011313	The weight of history feels astoundingly heavy when you stand in this place. {nl}Maybe you can find a clue about Medzio Diena here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011314	I keep thinking that Medzio Diena might have just been a process.{nl}If not, then why would the demons go after a mausoleum that is over a thousand years old? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011315	It's a good thing some Revelator stopped it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011316	Hergasercle was an incarnation of obsession. {nl}The chain of obsession was broken thanks to the Revelator,{nl}but its soul is not something that can be saved.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011321	This old withered man has no regret left on this earthly plane {nl}and is eager to return to the arms of the goddess.{nl}Please, hurry and light the signal at the top with this igniter.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011322	Yep. That's Canyon Apynys, alright.{nl}I am worried about the side effects, but I hope they go away soon.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011323	The bleeding has stopped, but my body feels numb.{nl}Can you defeat the monsters nearby so I can return safely?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011324	In order for these people to safely return to the village,{nl}we have to defeat these monsters.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011325	The last call stopped at the Crystal Mine.{nl}The brother should be safe... I am so worried.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011326	How can I say that this object is more important than a person.{nl}This is all due to the blessing of the goddess that our brother is safe.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011327	Eliminate the bats in Crystal Mine 1F and bring their wings as a proof.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011328	I welcome you with our family's courtesy.{nl}I trust Jonas has told you the details.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011329	You also need to possess courage and wisdom to release the seal. {nl}Perhaps, the Great King sought the proof of one's worthiness.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011330	Zachariel's Royal Mausoleum contains secrets of Medzio Diena. {nl}We already have most of the answers.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011331	But the remaining questions were the hardest ones. {nl}Ordinary historians like us have no way to solve them.{nl}While we were in aporia, we discovered that the help of a Revelator is needed to progress.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011332	I am aware of your reputation as a Revelator.{nl}Especially, the secret of the Royal Mausoleum should not be revealed to the public..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011333	If the secret of the Royal Mausoleum will bring destruction on land, concealing it is a must.{nl}That is why we seek your help.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011334	As I expected, this ordeal can be only passed to the Revelator.{nl} So that's it... it was prepared by the owner of the Royal Mausoleum after all.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011335	Great King Zachariel built this mausoleum to hide the secret.{nl}Peculiar, isn't it? A huge construct like this is far from inconspicuous...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011336	Well, it's no big issue.{nl}Everything has a reason for it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011337	The Royal Mausoleum must contain a secret bigger than we could possibly imagine.{nl}The next epitaph is at Serno Highland. Let's go.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011338	As Laulas' injury are severe, I'm here in his stead.{nl}The seal is released, what exactly happened here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011339	Anyhow, the altars here are one of the{nl}Royal Mausoleum's various defenses built to ward off intruders.{nl} Despite being built a long time ago, they have never been reactivated as no one knew the way to do so.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011340	The seal at Rukas Plateau could be the answer.{nl}The altar won't function if it gets destroyed, but if we can activate it before then.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011341	Although I don't know what Rexipher is trying to do.{nl}It sure can prevent him from doing it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011342	He is the traitor of the Kadumel Era and the owner of the Fortress of the Land.{nl}He was branded as the best swordsman even when he was young, {nl}and he had many people following him.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011343	Are you hurt?{nl}I heard the sound of Honeypin's webs, but I am relieved to see you are okay.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011344	Trusting Laima's words, I have been fighting the Demon Lord Bramble, {nl}who tried to take over the revelation. {nl}I have fought with it night and day to be able to hand the revelation to you. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011345	All of this was because of our pride...{nl}For we did not listen to what Laima said, unfortunately...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011346	But, ultimately, Medzio Diena, that the demons caused broke the balance of power.{nl}The goddesses lost most of their strength since that day.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011347	You better escape as well.{nl}The place is full of demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011348	Just moments ago, the demons were controlling the monsters in the Bastymosi Field.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011349	I don't know how strong you are, for you to do such a dangerous thing...{nl}I am not moving an inch from this very spot. If you wanna go, go alone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011350	From the Delmore Castle, I have been chased by the demons.{nl}I refuse to be in the same situation ever again.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011351	Thank you. Thank you so much.{nl}If I went under demon's control, what could have happened to those poor souls...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011352	The light bead you saw is actually... a human soul.{nl}No memory and will of its own. A soul in its purest form. An essence of a soul.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011353	These must be those who have lived around here...{nl}Even if they all got perished by the demons, it is a very strange that they become such pure souls.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011354	There must be a tomb of an unknown soldier here somewhere...{nl}The will of the Guide Owl will help you find the fragments of the ruined Karolis Altar.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011355	I should not have held my hopes up too high...{nl}Restoring the Karolis Altar was not enough to fully revive the forest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011356	The Altar of the Forest needs to be revived as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011357	Ah, the Altar of the Forest is located near the pond across there.{nl}It spreads Karolis' lights throughout the forest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011358	The lights are almost all out...{nl}If you can reignite them the power of the altar will spread out!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011359	The tower that has been controlling the owls is filled with very malicous energy.{nl}Even you should not touch it without any precaution.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011360	Now, use this power to blow the tower in the Duokliu Hall to the smithereens!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011361	You certainly are being lead by the goddess...{nl}I have that feeling.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011362	You've destroyed the Mind Control Tower as well?{nl}Now, peace will finally return.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011363	That's... that's a great relief.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011364	Mardas is the one who escaped from the Delmore Castle.{nl}The souls we have seen before must be from there as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011365	I have no idea why such atrocity has occurred in the Delmore Castle...{nl}These souls, as I have told you previously, do not possess any will of their own and memories.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011366	All that is left is the energy of a pure soul.{nl}This is definitely not an ordinary occurrence.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011367	It seems some magical power is draining the lifeforce out of living humans to extract souls...{nl}I lived in this forest for many years but this is unheard of.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011368	I have explained it to this man...{nl}The souls are being collected at Letas Stream and offered to the Divine Tree.{nl}The owls have sent the souls to that direction.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011369	At least we have to stop them.{nl}But Letas Stream has fallen into the hands of the demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011370	Could we ask you to help us a bit longer?{nl}You are our only hope....
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011371	Karolis Cradle is a spot enriched with the energy of the forest.{nl}Stand there and the energy will come to you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011372	As the energy concentration increases, it gets condensed and crystalized.{nl}Then take it to the Guide Owl.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011373	Ugh... What happened... Who are you?{nl}Did you save me?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011374	You have my utmost gratitude.{nl}Right before I lost consciousness, I saw the image of a goddess, it must have been you...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011375	Wha...? You already had it on you?{nl}That is great news. Bring it to the upper side of Atmesti Uphill and sprinkle the energy around.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011376	I believe that utilizing the malicious force of the monsters would be a good idea. {nl}Use it on monsters to purify their energies and absorb them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011377	By talking with the Chief Owl Sculpture, I got the feeling we could work this out.{nl}The demons are using the evil energy to corrupt Letas Stream and to trap souls.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011378	You will find the evil energy concentrated on the Svaigulys Hill.{nl}Set up the Namott of Suppression around it to remove the evil energy.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011379	Our priority is stopping the spot where the energy of the forest is getting drained.{nl}The spot is on the Senyvas Yard.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011380	The surveillance spheres are guarding Senyvas Yard, {nl}but without the Black Spirit, the demons' installation will weaken. {nl}Approaching it won't be easy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011381	It's rather risky but... I want you to infiltrate the place without getting {nl}detected by the surveillance spheres spinning around the Surveillance Eyes.{nl}At the end of the path, there is a magic circle managing those eyes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011382	If the magic circle is disabled, the surveilance spheres might be disabled with it as well.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011383	The Black Spirit can be removed with the Namott of Suppression, {nl}if we can deal with the surveilance spheres. Be careful. {nl}This mission is very dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011384	The Soul Starvation is on the lower side of Apsvaiges Path.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011385	The evil energy has weakened and the Black Smoke is gone.{nl}The demons, if they are not completely stupid, will notice these changes and come after us.{nl}Please, hurry up.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011386	Is that so... The souls are free now.{nl}The Owl Chief promised to guide the souls to their rightful place, the arms of the goddess.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011387	How can we ever repay you...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011388	Accessory Merchant Jurus
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011389	This letter is... left by Eras.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011390	This is the first time I have heard from him since ages ago... {nl}But now he went to the arms of the goddess...{nl}Fate is so cruel and gruesome to bear.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011391	Thank you for delivering this letter to me.{nl}At least, now I know what happened to him. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011392	So, you want to learn new magic, eh?{nl}But I need to be certain that you are prepared for it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011393	Without a firm foundation, learning is, naturally, very difficult.{nl}So, there's going to be a test.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011394	I like your attitude. I have a mission for you. {nl}Go into the Woods of the Linked Bridges and defeat some monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011395	That's quite simple, no? If you are unable to do this simple task, then I see no future between us.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011396	Here is your mission: Go into the Woods of the Linked Bridges and defeat some monsters.{nl}That's quite simple, no? If you are unable to do this simple task, then I see no future between us.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011397	Hmm, not bad. Not bad at all.{nl}You seem to have what it takes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011398	Now, pay attention to what I am about to demonstrate.{nl}How you use it alongside your current magic is up to you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011399	You want to become a Pyromancer?{nl}Kid, let me tell you something. Not everyone can become a Pyromancer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011400	Let's just say, you need to make friends with fire and its heat.{nl}I ain't all that convinced yet. But I will give you a chance to prove yourself.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011401	Good. Now, I want you to kill some monsters while under the magic I will put on you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011402	This magic will determine whether the spell you use is compatible with fire.{nl}Understood?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011403	If you are not compatible with fire, considering other paths is a viable option.{nl}There is no such thing as lukewarm flame.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011404	Oh my, you do have a knack. I am a bit surprised...?{nl}Well, a promise is a promise. I will teach ya.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011405	Whether you can follow it through or not is entirely up to ya. Got that?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011406	We, Cryomancers, always welcome newcomers. {nl}Like you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011407	However, accepting all participants will only prove itself detrimental to all of us.{nl}It is for the best if we conduct a simple test to determine your aptitude {nl}in becoming a Cryomancer.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011408	Here, inject your spell into this Piece of Ice.{nl}If you do not possess the necessary talent you require, the ice will melt.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011409	As you defeat monsters, your spell will be injected into this Piece of Ice.{nl}The instruction has been completed. Return to me when the result is successful.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011410	There was one testee who melted the Piece of Ice from the instant it touched.{nl}To be honest... that is a feat in itself.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011411	That is sufficient.{nl}I will grant you the teachings of Cryomancy.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011412	You really must be enjoying your life as an Archer if you're here to see me.{nl}Now, let's begin the test, shall we? Without seeing your power, we cannot be sure of anything.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011413	You are trustworthy.{nl}Obviously, an Archer should be able to hit a target from a distance.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011414	It doesn't matter what kind of a monster it is.{nl}As long as you hit your targets from as far away as possible.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011415	If you are either too close to the target or the target dodges your attack, it doesn't count.{nl}Got that?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011416	Do you see that bug over there? Can you hit one of its legs?{nl}The master in Klaipeda hit the bullseye blindfolded.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011417	You are better than I thought.{nl}I won't disappoint you in my training.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011418	I will be the first one to admit that I have no patience whatsoever. {nl}Defeating an enemy one by one is just not my style.{nl}I prefer attacking all of them at once.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011419	That's one of the reasons why I like being a Ranger. What about you?{nl}If you are a scaredy-cat, if the number is not in your favor, {nl}you better give up now and save both of our time.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011420	Let me see if you can walk the talk.{nl}But perhaps, facing off multiple enemies might be difficult yet.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011421	The next best thing to simultaneous combat is consecutive combat...{nl}Defeat one enemy and quickly attack the other. {nl}I want to see how much you can shorten that interval.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011422	Hesitating just once... and the enemies get close enough to kiss you.{nl}You don't want to get surrounded by enemies, do you?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011423	Impressive.{nl}I have seen so many malfunctioning nitwits who could not walk the talk...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011424	Having a student like you is always a pleasure.{nl}Now, let's see. What should I teach you first?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011425	I do not refuse the ones who are ambitious.{nl}Nevertheless, there is a prerequisite you must have.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011426	A well-loved piece of gear...{nl}That is the most important thing for all classes to be honest.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011427	I'm glad you agree.{nl}Now, show me a Lv +1 enhanced crossbow.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011428	A crossbow and a Quarrel Shooter go hand in hand.{nl}I will just take a look at it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011429	A charming crossbow, I must say. {nl}Alright, I must acknowledge your way of maintaining your weapon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011430	Learning itself is not too difficult so come to me any time.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011431	The time has come for you to learn the advanced magic of Wizards.{nl}You cannot learn new magic all by yourself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011432	Sometimes, the answer comes much quicker, if you ask around for advices.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011433	Some might say: "Too many cooks spoil the broth." {nl}You can't have too many advices.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011434	Did it help?{nl}Hmm, your enlightened eyes tells me yes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011435	All good. {nl}I will help you as far as I can. Hope you could do the same.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011436	At this stage, what you need to do is to improve your fire energy.{nl}For me, it's nothing at all but for you, some help would be necessary.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011437	Can't say it will be easy. {nl}Are you able to do it?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011438	That go-getter attitude is the sign of a good Pyromancer.{nl}Alright, take this Condensed Firestone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011439	Set it up near monsters and defeat them. Your fire energy infused with spell will be improved.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011440	Improving your magic is the most important thing, here, {nl}so it doesn't matter what monsters you slay.{nl}But this test would be more worthwhile if you fight the monsters your level, wouldn't it?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011441	Well done. {nl}I can sense your fire energy is much stronger than before.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011442	If you practice what I am about to teach ya...{nl}You can soon reach the top!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011443	If new magic is what you are looking for.{nl}Your current state indicates that you need to {nl}acquire more experiences handling the cold energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011444	Stronger magic awaits you but...{nl}Whether you can handle it is an entirely differnet matter.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011445	I do find your attitude quite optimal.{nl}I conjecture that Frost Tome will serve you well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011446	The ice resistance of the monsters increases with the power of that tome, defeat them.{nl}Colder than coldness itself... {nl}Only those who overcome such trial would have no trouble learning new magic.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011447	This trial will only have a meaning when that tome is used to defeat monsters.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011448	Your handling of the cold energy has improved.{nl}Optimal. Keep the previous combat in mind and observe my instruction carefully.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011449	Hmm... so you want to become a Psychokino.{nl}A great idea, I must say. Truly a magnificent choice.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011450	But not everyone can wield Psychokinesis.{nl}One must realize the innate power bestowed in you from the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011451	You probably have no idea what I am talking about, right?{nl}Well, that's because it needs to be felt rather than explained. {nl}Do you wish to take up on a challenge?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011452	Now, you seem prepared.{nl}Here's the scroll containing the spell of the Psychokino.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011453	At least, you will instantly obtain the taste of the magic we use.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011454	Use the scroll to feel the power inside you.{nl}Even just feeling it will make the learning much easier.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011455	Good, now did you get the taste of what is it like?{nl}We call it the psychic power.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011456	Enough with the theoretical learnings.{nl}Unto the practices of how to use psychic power.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011457	Having strong spells is certainly important but for a Linker, {nl}one must be able to empathize with the others.{nl}Finding the line connecting my mind and that of the other and making it reality. {nl}That is the job of a Linker.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011458	Was that far too complicated of an explanation?{nl}If so, let me give you a tip on a way to understand that... Are you up for it?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011459	A Linker must be able to find the connection point for each mana that each every one of us has.{nl}If you find this task to daunting, the way of a Linker is not for you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011460	I believe that such epiphany will come to you naturally if you keep on fighting with monsters.{nl}Although you are not yet a Linker, you too might be able to sense the connection point.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011461	Concentrate while battling monsters, you will see.{nl}All that is left is to hope that you have the talent.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011462	Did you feel it?{nl}Then, the rest is easy. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011463	Come back to me whenever you want to learn the Linker's magic.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011464	When you first came to Orsha, I had my doubts about you...{nl}But look at you now. Your tales of valour have spread out!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011465	This is a final test.{nl}Let me test on how much you understand the path of the Archer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011466	Although an Archer will not be defeated by anyone but, {nl}some enemies that can be tougher to beat. The flying cloth-type ones.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011467	Now, you know what to do, right?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011468	This is the Archer's Test Orb.{nl}It will record whether you have defeated ones properly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011469	I hope you are not lost, even with all those hints I have given you.{nl}This is all part of the test.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011470	How was it?{nl}Wasn't it easier than usual?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011471	No theory is left to teach you.{nl}The rest is practice! Even at the top, do not forget the basics.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011472	I am participating in those efforts myself as well.{nl}A Ranger is there to help those who are in danger.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011473	A part test, a part volunteer work. I want you to help the effort to restore Orsha, you up for it?{nl}A Ranger is there to help those who are in danger.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011474	The most urgent matter at hand is that we need the stone materials for rebuilding the wall.{nl}In Koru Jungle, you might find the appropriate stone.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011475	The roots really did a number on the wall.{nl}Not to mention the time I had to stop the Pyromancer Submaster from burning them all down...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011476	Woah, now you did diligently. {nl}It would do a lot of good.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011477	I am a bit busy but a promise is a promise. I will teach you the new skills.{nl}Learn well and practice as often as possible.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011478	You seem to be ready to learn new skills.{nl}But at the moment, there is a lot on my plate... {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011479	Help me on this and then I might be able to help you back.{nl}How about that? Help me rebuild Orsha. It will be worthwhile.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011480	It seems there is a shortage of materials.{nl}Especially, the adhesive to hold the bricks tight.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011481	Defeat Plant-type monsters and obtain the sticky liquid from them.{nl}A stronger monster is the stronger fluid it yields.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011482	Everyone is on the effort to rebuild Orsha, our home.{nl}On that fateful Medzio Diena, we all thought the world would end... {nl}But there are some things that even such catastrophe cannot break.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011483	You came back earlier than I expected.{nl}All good. Everything seems to be getting into its rightful place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011484	Nice to meet you. {nl}You must be the new applicant for becoming a Sapper?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011485	The ideal Sapper is the one who is always cautious.{nl}The one who flawedly sets up traps can ruin the flow of the battlefield.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011486	I am a Sapper and a soldier. I detest jokey attitude.{nl}I will see how serious you work on the mission, {nl}and I will determine whether you can be in or out.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011487	I am currently researching and developing a new kind of trap.{nl}It is going to be something completely different from all the previous traps.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011488	Go to Koru Jungle and find me some Sturdy Research Stones.{nl}If you take this mission seriously, you will not bring stone that crumble upon a mere touch.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011489	It doesn't matter how strong you are, if you have an inappropriate attitude, {nl}You are out. Understood? {nl}One wrongfully set up trap can cause irreparable damage to the rest of the team.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011490	Hm. You've passed the test.{nl}I must warn you my training is harsh and strict. Only concentrating through is the only way.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011491	A Hunter, eh? I take it that you're good with a bow and arrow?{nl}If it were all up to me, I would take everyone in but if I did that, think of all the shenanigans.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011492	So let me test you on your worthiness to become one of my students.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011493	A Hunter needs to be able to enjoy the danger and the thrill it entails.{nl}For example... Ah, yes, like inside a dungeon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011494	It doesn't matter which monster in a dungeon.{nl}What's important is to keep calm in a dangerous situation. {nl}If then, I will acknowledge you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011495	Hmm... I think the Ashaq Underground Prison or the Novaha Monastery would be too easy.{nl}The more danger there lurks, there higher your score will be.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011496	Well, you got it.{nl}Good. I think, you've proven your worth.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011497	Welcome back. {nl}I think, it is a high time you go through a trial by fire.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011498	If you can pass this trial, you can be recognized as a true Pyromancer.{nl}It won't be easy, but you wanna try it?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011499	Right, for your trial, you must combat the ones that are {nl}most familiar to us and yet most pestersome to deal with...{nl}Of course, I am talking about fire property monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011500	It doesn't matter which type.{nl}Godspeed.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011501	In order to fend off fire property monsters, you must strike them down with greater force.{nl}Or you must utilize other properties of magic.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011502	I knew you could do it.{nl}Now, this would be our last training, so listening up.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011503	I have taught numerous Cryomancers...{nl}But no one achieved your current state as fast as you did.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011504	Now, this is your final test.{nl}A trial by cold, the ultimate test.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011505	Knowing thyself and the enemy is the most important.{nl}A trial by cold is to defeat a ice property monster.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011506	That is what it takes to be on the top of all the other Cryomancers.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011507	You didn't think it would be that easy to reach the top, did you?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011508	Now, that is a slice of fried gold. {nl}You've exceeded my expectation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011509	I will guide you to...{nl}The top of Cryomancy.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011510	Being a Psychokino requires you to evaluate situations precisely.{nl}Gaining the position of advantage will certainly help you in combat.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011511	That is up to you to realize it. Only then will you be able to learn more advanced magic.{nl}Show me what you got, if you can take it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011512	This is the Spell Detector Orb.{nl}The range is bit short, but it can detect spells around it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011513	Defeat monsters within the range of the Spell Detector Orb.{nl}It will probably take you some calculations to find the right spot.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011514	Just like real estate, the most important thing is location, location and location, {nl}so the type, level or property of the monster don't matter.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011515	Hmm... better than I expected.{nl}Keep up the good work.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011516	A Linker. A Linker is the one who connects one's mana with other's mana...{nl}That is what makes us so special.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011517	However, if you go beyond the mana and connect the soul itself. {nl}You could reach a new unknown territory.{nl}If you want to expand the Linker's horizon, please, help me on my research.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011518	Fill this Soul Flask with spiritual powers.{nl}Defeat the monsters and the spiritual powers will absorb into the flask.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011519	If this research is successful, all the Linkers will benefit from it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011520	Now, that's a full flask.{nl}Thank you very much, it's only fitting that I have to repay you for this.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011521	You will learn new magic from this point on.{nl}Please, follow my instructions attentively like always.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011522	Do you seek the way to become a Thaumaturge?{nl}Hm, we, Thaumaturges, wield the magic to transform the types and properties of entities.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011523	What is the most important is a keen eye to read the flow of combat.{nl}For you to know how to lead the situation in your favor.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011524	Enough talking. Let's get to the practical lessons.{nl}Theoretical learning is quite boring for my taste.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011525	A Thaumaturge's magic has one that can change size of entities.{nl}Whether it's an ally or an enemy, it doesn't matter.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011651	I understand that Rose is worried about her people.{nl}But they probably just left for Orsha because of the migration order, isn't it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011652	Because of all of this we ran into the demons and I lost my luggage.{nl}And all my expensive items were there... They were my only assets.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011653	But I can't ask our group to go out and get it...{nl}The demons will be all over us if we so much as try to move. It's a tough call...

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011661	For now I think I'll stay here with my colleagues and wait for Rose.{nl}I'm still worried about the demons and the monsters, though.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011662	I really thought a demon had found me earlier, then I saw your face and, phew...{nl}I felt as if my prayers to the goddesses had been answered.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011663	Oh? You really took care of it?{nl}What a relief to hear that. Thanks a lot.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011664	It was really unexpected...{nl}We barely saw any monsters before, and now all of a sudden we have to deal with demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011665	At least I survived, but the wounds feel strangely swollen and hot.{nl}Will you bring me some herbs? I'm hoping they'll ease the pain a little bit.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011666	It's called Ronjia Grass, it looks a little different from the grass around it.{nl}I think there's some on the Nevaginga Hillside.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011668	You got it! Hand them over.{nl}They're probably a little bitter but I really need it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011669	This is... It looks serious.{nl}I mean, it's a wound caused by a demon, so I don't think it'll ever really heal.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011670	Tales...? Oh, the one who always found me rare herbs.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011671	You said the wounds are swollen, hot and discolored?{nl}If the Ronjia Grass doesn't work, then he must be affected by evil energy.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011672	I think the Cleric Submaster in Orsha might be able to help.{nl}I once helped her get some herbs.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011673	Tell her about my symptoms.{nl}My wounds are swollen, hot and now they're turning purple...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011674	His condition is only expected to get worse with time.{nl}I'm going to give you some medicine to purify the evil energy in his body; please give it to Tales.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011675	Give it him as soon as possible.{nl}The longer you wait, the more the evil energy will spread.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011676	The medicine you brought seems to be working. {nl}My temperature should start to lower, too.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011677	I thought I was about to return to the goddesses like this...{nl}You really saved my life.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011678	Hm? I thought you'd left earlier...{nl}What are you doing here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011679	Ah... You were worried about me?{nl}Thank you. I don't think the demons have noticed me yet.{nl}I'll look somewhere else.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011680	I'm going back to the village and look through our house.{nl}If they're gone because of the migration order, my brother should've left a note.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011681	Really?{nl}I can be trouble sometimes, but thank you for worrying about me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011682	Will you have a look around the village, then?{nl}I'm thinking there will be some clues left.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011683	I was actually worried about coming alone, so thank you.{nl}Now if only we can find the people of my village.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011684	It looks like... something bad has happened.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011685	The inside of our house is a complete chaos and there's demon footprints everywhere.{nl}I couldn't find any notes either.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011686	I wonder what could've happened.{nl}I've seen too many villages destroyed by demon attacks during my trips as a merchant, you know.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011687	What if... No. I'm worrying too much, aren't I?{nl}There would be at least some tombs left behind if that were the case, {nl}but there aren't any. Right? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011688	Those beads, though... I saw them before, too...{nl}I wonder if they're from Anne's necklace.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011689	That's odd. She would never drop her necklace...{nl}It's very precious to Anne, you see.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011690	Still... The beads could be a clue to help us find where the villagers are.{nl}Anne is smart enough to have done something like that. She was always clever.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011691	I wouldn't think much of it otherwise, but all the mess and the demon footprints...{nl}It's just bothering me.{nl}The only strange thing we've found so far are the beads from Anne's necklace...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011692	Let's try and follow the trail of the beads.{nl}We need to try something, anything.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011693	Let's try and follow the trail of the beads.{nl}Hopefully we can find something...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011694	It looks like the beads end here.{nl}I don't see any more of them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011695	We can't give up.{nl}Maybe we're just not seeing the rest of the beads.{nl}They could've been kicked out of the way by monsters or...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011696	Let's take a look around.{nl}I'm sure we're missing something here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011697	I feel so desperate I want to cry.{nl}Please let us find something, please...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011698	Tess
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011699	Don't hurt me!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011700	I'm saved! I'm finally saved...{nl}Oh... It was horrible...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011701	Everyone in the village was taken.{nl}The demons said they were going to use a type of bracken to feed us to the Divine Tree.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011702	Yes, the Divine Tree from four years ago!{nl}The one that spurted from under the ground and destroyed our cities on Medzio Diena...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011703	I managed to escape, but everyone else was taken to the Novaha Monastery.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011704	When the demons were taking us they suddenly stopped and a wizard appeared.{nl}I could tell for sure he was human... Oh, but that's not important.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011705	The wizard approached us one by one and then he did some sort of strange ritual.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011706	At first no one showed much of a reaction... {nl}But when it was Edmundas' turn, there was a light.{nl}Yes, Rose, your brother Edmundas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011707	The wizard had Edmundas taken somewhere separately.{nl}Then he started to threaten us, asking if he had any family...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011708	I feel so sorry to Rose, but we were so afraid we had no choice.{nl}As soon as the wizard heard about Rose, he started saying some really scary things.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011709	Was it Kru... Kruvina? He said it was completed...{nl}He said the giant bracken was almost ready and soon he would spread the spores of death.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011710	He said all he needed was to find someone qualified to feed us to the Divine Tree.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011711	I thought I needed to tell Orsha about this so I took the chance and ran away.{nl}I've been hiding from the demons here ever since.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011712	What do I do? Edmundas, my brother... {nl}My brother was taken by the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011713	Orsha is too far from here!{nl}Please, help us save our people...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011714	I saw something strange when I was picking herbs.{nl}There was a wizard... A human, no doubt. But he was giving orders to the demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011715	Suddenly he saw me and I had to run as fast as I could.{nl}I'm scared and I want to go back to Orsha, {nl}but I can't bring myself to do it with all these demons around.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011716	Fortunately it seems like Goss is fine.{nl}I hope he knows a way to open the door...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011717	A few months ago, demons started to appear in Knidos Jungle.{nl}Many good herbs used to grow around here... Not so much anymore.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011718	Thank you.{nl}I wonder, where could all the people of the Croa Village have gone?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011719	Have you ever heard about demons picking herbs?{nl}I've been picking herbs for a long time but that was a first, even for me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011720	I'm tired of running from demons, too, but...{nl}As a herb gatherer myself I can't help but be curious.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011721	If that's fine with you, will you pick some those herbs so I can see what they are?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011722	I was hiding so I couldn't take a good look at them, but the leaves were small and thin.{nl}It's to right, at the Neneva Yard.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011723	I saw a human-looking wizard give orders to the demons.{nl}Humans associating with demons...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011724	I didn't recognize it before but...{nl}These are Aconites.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011725	They're medicinal, but deadly when consumed in large doses.{nl}I wonder why they want this...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011726	The demons may scare me, but as a herb gatherer I can't let this go.{nl}I think it's best to destroy all the Aconites.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011727	Go and collect some Loktanun fluid.{nl}It's very acidic; it wil dry out the Aconites if you spray them with it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011728	The demons may be scary...{nl}But I won't let them get away with this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011729	Thank you.{nl}This should be enough.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011730	It's a shame to waste all the Aconites, but there's no way the demons will put it to good use.{nl}You can go back to the Neneva Yard and spray the demon fluid all around.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011731	This is the most I can do.{nl}You only need to spray a little to dry out the flowers.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011732	This is all that wizard's fault.{nl}I saw him talking to those demons with my very own eyes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011733	Thank you for helping me.{nl}Now that the Aconites are gone, I hope they can't carry out whatever plan they had.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011734	Have you ever seen such a big bracken?{nl}I know this area is known for it, but even for a local like me, it's a first.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011735	Remember what Tess said earlier?{nl}About the giant bracken spreading out the spores of death...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011736	This looks like what Tess was talking about.{nl}We need to think of a way to stop that wizard's plans.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011737	The device set up next to the bracken... It could be an important key.{nl}I wonder if there's something like a lab around here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011738	I feel like I was too reckless coming out to rescue my brother and the villagers without a plan.{nl}I want to do something fast, but I'm afraid I'll end up making a mistake.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011739	Did you find anything?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011740	So there really is a laboratory.{nl}There could be more information about the device there.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011741	Thank you for saving me.{nl}It seems all I do is receive your help...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011742	I think that person is the wizard Tess was talking about.{nl}Someone qualified... Even if it's me they want, I can't just leave my people behind.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011743	We still don't know what the red liquid inside the device is, so destroying it could be dangerous.{nl}Let me have a look at the journal you found in the laboratory.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011744	Let's see...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011745	It's not hard to turn off the device after all. {nl}Seems like all you need to do is remove the power sources, which are set up separately.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011746	But we have to be careful.{nl}The journal says the power supply devices are protected by powerful freezing magic circles.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011747	It doesn't say how to disable the magic circles.{nl}But we should be able to use monsters as bait, right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011748	We can probably lure them into the circles and quickly remove the power sources.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011749	That red liquid inside the device, though... It makes me feel sick just looking at it.{nl}What could it be...?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011750	Did you do it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011751	If the journal is correct, soon we won't have to worry about the giant bracken anymore.{nl}Let's go to the Novaha Monastery, then.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011752	Security is too strict.{nl}The demons are guarding the entrance to the Novaha Monastery.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011753	My brother and the villagers... They'll be safe, right?{nl}Please try not too make too much of a commotion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011754	You need to be as quiet as possible.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011755	I'm sure my brother and the villagers are still safe since they have no use for them yet...{nl}But this could go very wrong if we're not careful.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011756	Are you alright?{nl}Your skills are really incredible.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011757	Let's go inside the Novaha Monastery, then.{nl}Please, let everyone be safe...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011758	Herbalist Talas
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011759	Help!{nl}I was caught in a trap running away from the demons!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011760	Please help me!{nl}I can't open the trap by myself...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011761	Thank you. Fortunately my ankle isn't completely gone yet.{nl}If it weren't for you I would be in the hands of the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011762	I did see something odd before I escaped.{nl}The demons were adding herbs to a cauldron.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011763	I had never seen demons use any herbs, but I'm sure whatever it is they're doing, it's evil.{nl}I was on my way to stop them when this happened...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011764	Destroying the cauldrons won't be easy.{nl}They're protected by some sort of barrier.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011765	Every time a barrier appeared I noticed a sort of glowing stone.{nl}I wonder if that's what we should target first.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011766	Fearful people like me can tell that much. {nl}Those cauldrons are nothing but evil.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011767	Thank you. This should be enough to repay you for the trap.{nl}Helping stop the demons makes me feel like I achieved something great.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011768	Oh, I have one last favor to ask.{nl}We may have destroyed the cauldrons, but the materials remain. This could be a problem.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011769	I believe it would be better to burn down the materials as well.{nl}They're at the Saloto Lowland. Make sure they're all gone.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011770	I hear the demons aren't going to stop at simply existing.{nl}Are the goddesses missing the work of demons too, I wonder?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011771	I'm relieved to hear that. Thank you.{nl}I ought to stop playing a hero and take care of myself now.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011772	There are voices coming from the other side of this door.{nl}I think the villagers are locked inside here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011773	But the door isn't moving, even though there's no lock in sight.{nl}What do we do...?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011774	If only we can get this door to open...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011775	If it weren't for you and Rose...{nl}I would have been just another victim to the bracken.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011776	Just when I thought we were over... you came and saved us.{nl}It seems the goddesses haven't abandoned me yet...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011777	Croa Village Resident
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011778	Who are you?!{nl}Are you here to save us?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011779	The way to open the door?{nl}You need to get to Goss, quick!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011780	The demons took Goss to the Ankel Small Corridor!{nl}He knows how to open the door!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011781	I think Goss knows how to open the door.{nl}We should be able to rescue the villagers now.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011782	When the guards aren't looking, we need to go and free the villagers as fast as we can.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011783	The Ankel Small Corridor... It's to the left.{nl}The first thing to do is rescue Goss, like the villagers said.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011784	I'll head there first.{nl}Meet me at the Ankel Small Corridor.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011785	The demons saw us.{nl}We should get out of here with the villagers now.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011786	The demons are going to come for us.{nl}We need to get the villagers and run immediately.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011787	I don't know but it looks complicated.{nl}Still, I think Goss will probably know a way.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011788	If we can only open the door we can rescue the villagers...{nl}But the demons will notice us.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011789	I noticed Rose was looking for her brother... Unfortunately I haven't seen him.{nl}I wonder if they didn't take him to the annex, where I was...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011790	Thank you for saving me.{nl}Seeing you and Rose makes me feel like the missing goddesses are back among us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011791	A way to open the door... I will have to take a look at it myself.{nl}Meet me in front of the door.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011792	Help me...{nl}I have no strength left in my body...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011793	I... I don't want them to come for me anymore...{nl}I'm so afraid... Those things...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011794	Hm... I couldn't see it from inside the room, but it's clear looking at it from the outside.{nl}The door has been tampered with.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011795	This faint magic circle... It's made to react only to demons.{nl}It looks like you would have to prove that you're a demon in order to open the door.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011796	Some Green Apparition Essences should suffice. {nl}Meanwhile I'll have a look at the circle.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011797	A few days ago...{nl}The monastery was ambushed by demons and, unable to resist, I ended up in their hands.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011798	After Medzio Diena, maintaining the monastery has been no easy task.{nl}Apart from me and few other brothers, there was no one left in the monastery, you see.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011799	The demons kept every single one of us locked inside the annex.{nl}We didn't know the demons' demands or their reasoning; all we could do was pray.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011800	A few brothers were dragged outside one by one... they never came back.{nl}When only three of us were left, the demons came for me and locked me in this Reading Room.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011801	Then... they brought in people of the Croa Village.{nl}Just like before, they started to come for and take them one by one.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011802	Just as my turn was coming... that's when you saved me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011803	Hey, you!{nl}Stop wandering around and run, quick!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011804	There are demons here!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011805	I couldn't possibly rescue my people all by myself, I even thought of escaping to Orsha...{nl}You really are something, huh?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011806	I feel worthless for failing to protect the people of my village.{nl}I can only beg for the goddesses to forgive me...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011807	We should have hired some soldiers. This is getting more and more difficult.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011808	I think it'll be hard to move anywhere until our people recover.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011809	I see you gathered plenty of essences, I can feel it all the way here.{nl}Good... I'm ready now, too.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011810	I understand that Rose is worried, but...{nl}If things go wrong we can lose our lives before we even see the villagers, {nl}let alone our possessions.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011811	I think the door should be easy to open.{nl}It could take quite some time, however...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011812	Not to mention all the demons walking around since you went and collected the essence. {nl}They'll surely notice what I'm doing. Just protect me while I try and open the door.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011813	I got it!{nl}This is... phew... a huge relief.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011814	I noticed Rose was looking for her brother... Unfortunately I haven't seen him.{nl}I wonder if he wasn't taken to the Annex, where I was...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011815	I wish I could go and help you... I'm sorry. {nl}Injured as I am I would be a burden to you, and there's people in need of care here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011816	I'll pray to the goddesses that Rose may find her brother.{nl}And may you receive their blessing...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011817	You're saying my brother could be at the Novaha Annex?{nl}Why would they take him alone...?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011818	We need to make sure the villagers escape first.{nl}My brother will be fine... I'm sure...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011819	It looks like the demon barrier is a little loose now.{nl}It feels odd but we can't waste our chance. We should move quickly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011820	It looks like the demon barrier is a little loose now.{nl}It feels odd but we can't waste our chance. We should move quickly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011821	Are you okay?{nl}I thought the barrier had loosened up... We need to be careful.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011822	Everyone has escaped from the Reading Room now.{nl}We should move to the Annex... and save my brother.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011823	Help...{nl}The demons... they experimented on me and left me here abandoned...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011824	I can't escape, I'm too exhausted to even move. {nl}There's nothing I can do but hide and wait for the day I return to the goddess...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011825	I feel a lot better now.{nl}I swear, my vision was starting to get blurry, I really thought I was over.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011826	Just thinking about that experiment...{nl}It makes me want to leave this place immediately.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011827	I won't ask you to come all the way with me!{nl}All I ask is that you clear out some demons so I can escape, will you do that?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011828	They put me inside magic circles, they fed me things...{nl}It was horrible.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011829	Thank you. Really, thank you so much!{nl}The others should be fine too... right?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011830	I should escape from this place now.{nl}May the goddesses bless you!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011831	Experiment Victim Fils
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011832	I may have survived, but what is it worth...{nl}I have no one now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011833	Run away while you can...{nl}They're doing horrible experiments here...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011834	How can someone call themselves human and do something so... atrocious?{nl}Not even demons are this evil...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011835	Thank you for bringing these to me.{nl}As soon as I escape this monastery I'm going to make a tomb with these objects...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011836	Experiment Victim Hilbeth
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011837	How am I going to live now...?{nl}I have no will to be alive anymore...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011838	I wish we'd escaped sooner.{nl}How can I live now without my family...?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011839	You're... not from the Croa Village, are you?{nl}And you don't look like you're a Novaha monk, either.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011840	I want to ask you something... All my friends, my family... my neighbors...{nl}They all returned to the goddesses because of the experiments.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011841	I do want to avenge them, but most of all I want to mourn those who are gone. {nl}Would you bring me some of their belongings?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011842	One thing I regret is not being able to return to the village.{nl}The merchants have no work there anymore, either. I miss our people already...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011843	We're here now, but I think the Annex is too big.{nl}It'll be faster if we split up and look for my brother.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011844	I'm not sure how I can cover such a wide area...{nl}Alright.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011845	It's me who the demons want...{nl}They could easily catch me if I'm not careful and then I'll be just another burden on you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011846	I'll wait here, where it's safe.{nl}Please tell me as soon as you find my brother.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011847	Anne
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011848	I really treasured that necklace...{nl}But if it helped Rose find us all the way here, it was for a good cause.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011849	By the way, where is Rose?{nl}And Edmundas?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011850	The thing about finding someone qualified is bothering me.{nl}He'll be all right... won't he?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011851	Allonas
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011852	The memories of being taken by the demons still hurt.{nl}Some of us haven't made it back yet, either...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011853	We're alive thanks to you and Rose...{nl}But I don't think the village will be the same again.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011854	You found my brother in the Apega State Chamber?{nl}Then... why isn't he with you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011855	So he's strapped to some weird device?{nl}Let's go, then! We have to save him!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011856	What on earth could this be?{nl}It wouldn't be this red if you threw a whole bottle of ink in it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011857	I... I don't trust what these youngsters are doing. No, sir.{nl}I know I can find a way if they would just let me, but they want to keep me out of it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011858	If it weren't for me they wouldn't have found any clues at all.{nl}I was the one who figured the problem was in the ruins in the first place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011859	And all these kids tell me is to stay put, to behave.{nl}This really.... This really is frustrating, you know.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011860	What do we do... My brother is suffering.{nl}The wizard must have put him in this device so he couldn't escape...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011861	He says the pain started when the wizard came inside the Apega State Chamber.{nl}I'll stay here and keep an eye on him. You go and find a way to stop this. Quick!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011862	My brother is looking worse.{nl}I can't even go near him because of this barrier...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011863	My brother... he's fine now.{nl}I was so worried about what might happen to him...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011864	You saved my life. Thank you, really.{nl}But didn't you find something useful because of me? We're even, then.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011865	I don't know what they did here, or who did it, but we can't let this go.{nl}Sigh, it's tough...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011866	Rose... she's...!{nl}That's why I told her to run... Why didn't she listen to me...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011867	So I was nothing but bait to get Rose to come here.{nl}And now this... What do we do...?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011868	We came from a village downwards from here.{nl}We came to try and figure out what's causing the water contamination.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011869	I know grandpa is trying to do the right thing but... {nl}it's dangerous with all these monsters around.{nl}I wish he could understand this.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011870	My grandfather could be getting in trouble, please go find him.{nl}He could've just waited for you to go with him.... Sigh.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011871	That wizard... He's going to do to Rose the same experiments he did on me...{nl}He's going to use her to spread the giant bracken spores.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011872	Release me first.{nl}Then help me bring Rose back, I beg you...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011873	I'm glad everyone's safe, thanks to you.{nl}I have to confess this was quite reckless, even with you around.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011874	Wow, so the Hydra was the so-called vessel...{nl}I wonder what kind of person would put a gem on the Hydra, and for what?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011875	There should be some device to shut this down around here somewhere.{nl}Please... before anything bad happens to Rose.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011876	Thank you for releasing me.{nl}I'm so exhausted... But I have to save Rose.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011877	Please. Help me save Rose.{nl}I know we've only just met and it's not right of me to ask so much of you right away, but please.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011878	Rose... She's my little sister, my only one. I can't bear to lose her.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011879	I know where they took Rose. The main monastery building... {nl}If you can lend me some of your strength, please come with me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011880	You... You don't seem like you're with that wizard.{nl}Please, don't ignore me... Help me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011881	I barely just escaped from the demons.{nl}But the experiments were hard on me... My body is too exhausted right now...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011882	You'll find my bag of herbs in the Tebeti Small Corridor.{nl}Please... bring it to me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011883	My family is waiting for me.{nl}I should go back...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011884	Thank you.{nl}Now if I can just gather enough strength to walk...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011885	I'm still injured, but I think I can move now.{nl}I should get up and go rescue my family.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011886	You say you're going to help me find my family? {nl}Really? Wow, I don't know what to say...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011887	My family was taken to the Collapsed Grand Corridor.{nl}I hope nothing happened to them...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011888	I promised them I would be back.{nl}They'll be all right... I'm sure they will.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011889	That... That thing you're holding...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011890	That's Anne's bracelet... Her parents...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011891	I have one last favor to ask.{nl}I can't let these horrible experiments keep happening...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011892	Please destroy the demon experiment equipment in the Errzze Oratorium.{nl}Please... I don't want anyone else to fall victim to this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011893	We have to stop any more experiments like this from happening...{nl}I don't want anyone else to suffer...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011894	Thank you.{nl}How... How am I going to live now...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011895	Monk Abels
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011896	It's... too late for me now.{nl}Please, traveler, will you spare me some of your time? I don't have much left myself...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011897	All my life I have dedicated to my service here at the Novaha Monastery...{nl}I can't bear to see it tainted by demons as it is.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011898	Please help me purify the monastery.{nl}Gather the holy relic fragments in the Gaile Chapel...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011899	Please help me complete this final mission.{nl}I can't return to the goddess with the monastery tainted by these demons...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011900	Are those the fragments...?{nl}My vision is becoming blurry but I can feel their energy.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011901	There's... not much left now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011902	I gathered all the strength I have left to restore the holy relic.{nl}Use this around the monastery...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011903	...I'm terribly sorry to the people of the Croa Village.{nl}I failed to protect them...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011904	How I wish to see the monastery fully purified again... I'm afraid I won't have the time.{nl}I should rest...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011905	Oh... You're here.{nl}I'm beyond grateful that you decided to do this favor for me...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011906	Rose will probably have to go through the same experiments I did.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011907	We could just go after the wizard right away to try and save Rose but...{nl}I don't think she would make it until then.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011908	We need to stop the experiment.{nl}We need to find the wizard's devices and destroy them. {nl}That'll buy us time until we can get to Rose.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011909	I don't know what this device in front of me is...{nl}But I saw the wizard put something black in it to turn it on, {nl}then suddenly the air was filled with something nauseating.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011910	I felt something grow inside of my body, it was extremely painful.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011911	Then the pain stopped, but the wizard became furious.{nl}He said something about finding someone who's qualified...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011912	If Rose is the one they want, she'll be going through the same pain right now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011913	If only we can get whatever item the wizard used on the device...{nl}If we put too much of it in the device, I think there's a chance it might overload and shut down.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011914	I saw the wizard tell the demons to go hunt Brown Hummingbirds for it.{nl}Anything is fine, just gather what you can and bring it to me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011915	Let's gather more Hummingbird Mucus and destroy the device.{nl}The more the better. I'll pour it in all at once.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011916	Those who are qualified will not return to the goddesses, despite the pain.{nl}That doesn't mean it's painless, however...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011917	Success!{nl}The device overloaded and stopped working.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011918	The next device is in the Main Hall Atrium.{nl}Let's meet up there.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011919	That magic crystal...{nl}The wizard used it for a mind control ritual in the atrium at first.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011920	The crystal was glowing and I felt my conscience leaving me.{nl}When I opened my eyes... I was lying inside the Kilnuma Oratorium.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011921	Rose is probably going through the same thing.{nl}But without the protective barrier device, we can't destroy the crystal.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011922	Something bad could happen to Rose if we destroy the magic crystal.{nl}Still... no matter what happens, {nl}I don't think Rose wouldn't want to be used to spread out the death spores.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011923	Are you done?{nl}The wizard did say the host would act like a switch...{nl}As long as Rose is safe again, I'll do whatever it takes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011924	There are too many monsters here.{nl}Take the elevator and let's meet upstairs.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011925	Rose will be here at the Kilnuma Oratorium.{nl}I wish I could rescue her myself, but I'm afraid I lack the skills to do it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011926	Please let it not be too late...{nl}Even if it is, your help will have been life-saving.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011927	You... you saved me again.{nl}And my brother, too... Are you okay?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011928	I was hoping my brother would have survived and escaped this place...{nl}But it's so good to see him again... I guess you can say I was lying to myself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011929	I still can't believe I'm alive, that I haven't returned to the goddesses.{nl}And I... Yes. I know now. I know what I have to do...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011930	I... I'm already infected with the spore.{nl}But don't worry. I'm qualified so I won't return to the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011931	But you never know when the spore might become active...{nl}I don't think I can return to the village.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011932	It's okay.{nl}This life of mine that you saved... I'm going to live it to the absolute fullest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011933	By the way, I should tell you something.{nl}When the wizard was trying to control my mind, {nl}for a moment I was able to look into his memory.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011934	This wizard... He's sided with the demons.{nl}Also, there are other leaders and followers of this plan.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011935	Everything was connected to the Divine Tree.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011936	Humans can't coexist with the Divine Tree...{nl}So they created the giant bracken to spread out the death spores all the way to Orsha.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011937	To control that, they needed someone who can survive being infected with the spores.{nl}That's why they were looking for someone who qualifies for that... And it was me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011938	Oh, that red liquid we saw on the giant bracken came from the Pelke Shrine Ruins.{nl}And I also saw a strange light concentrating at the Letas Stream.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011939	The demons and their human followers are doing something monumental.{nl}I can't even begin to understand what it is...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011940	This is all I can tell you...{nl}There's other things here and there, but they're just fragments I can't properly explain to you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011941	I haven't been able to rest ever since arriving at the Koru Jungle...{nl}I should rest now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011942	Yes, it was all thanks to you.{nl}Thank you so much... really.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011943	I may not qualify perfectly, but I'm close.{nl}And I think I'm already infected with the spores, too... {nl}I'm going to stay with Rose and look after her.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011944	But right now I'm worried about the monsters. {nl}My body still hasn't recovered.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011945	Usually I wouldn't have any trouble clearing out this many monsters...{nl}But that's when I'm in better condition. I'm afraid you'll have to...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011946	You have been a lifesaver.{nl}With the goddesses gone, having you close has given me strength.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011947	I can handle the monsters once my body recovers but...{nl}I don't think I can take the demons left in the monastery yet.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011948	But it's not right for me to ask you to clear out all the demons here...{nl}It's a tricky situation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011949	That's right. There is someone in Orsha called Dejamis who owes me a favor.{nl}She is the Wizard Submaster; will you go there and let her know about my situation?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011950	Wizard Submaster
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011951	I know Edmundas very well.{nl}He would always find me rare herbs faster than anyone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011952	What a terrible thing to happen to someone like him...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011953	By the way, don't tell anyone but Dejamis about what happened to us.{nl}I don't want people to be afraid of us, and I don't wasn't us to be treated like freaks.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011954	Don't worry.{nl}I won't tell anyone about what happened to the siblings.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011955	I don't know how to cure them right away...{nl}What I can do for now is make a protective barrier {nl}to keep the two of them safe from demon attacks.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011956	They say if you want to hide a tree, you put it in a forest.{nl}I'm saying we trick the demons using the demons themselves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011957	I'm going to give you the recipe and an empty barrier crystal.{nl}Collect demon stones from Deadborn Scaps to make the protection barrier crystal.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011958	With all the demons and monsters, if it weren't for you and Laswi...{nl}I don't even want to know.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011959	I ended up coming here because of Rose, the damage done is unimaginable...{nl}But I hope the people of Rose's village will be all right.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011960	I'll keep looking for a way to cure the siblings.{nl}Tell Edmundas I said hi.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011961	Set it up around here.{nl}I feel safe now knowing Dejamis made it for us.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011962	A few months back demons started to appear in Knidos Jungle.{nl}A lot of good herbs used to grow around here... Not so much anymore.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011963	The world really is going to ruins.{nl}It's the same thing I felt four years ago on Medzio Diena...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011964	A protective barrier crystal should keep the siblings safe from any threats.{nl}Of course the ideal would be to find a real solution...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011965	As long as we're not cured from the spores we can't return to the village.{nl}We might just have to live here forever.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011966	That's okay.{nl}I'm just grateful for the chance to be with Rose again.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011967	Thank you for everything.{nl}I don't know if we'll ever meet again but I'm sure both of us will never forget you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011968	Experiments like the ones they did in the monastery must never happen again. {nl}We have to tell everyone about it and stop them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011969	I'm sure there will be traces of the experiments inside the monastery. {nl}Try and find any journals or anything the wizard might have left behind.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011970	It'll probably be hard to find evidence like experiment journals, {nl}but it's important that we tell people about it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011971	Are these materials you found inside the Novaha Monastery?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011972	There might be more materials around that we still haven't found.{nl}But I won't keep asking you to go here; this time I'll try and find them myself.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011973	Can I ask you for one last favor?{nl}When I was inside the wizard's memories, I saw the device used for breeding the bracken spores.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011974	As long as the device for breeding the spores is there, it will keep happening.{nl}This... This experiment can never happen again... Never.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011975	If the power sources are removed, the spores will die off.{nl}The thing is, if you don't do it in the right order, it will activate again.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011976	The bracken spore breeding device is inside the Sotras Chapel.{nl}Don't worry if you fail... Just keep trying to find the right sequence.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011977	I guess the mind control wasn't all too bad.{nl}All we need to do now is remove the power sources and the spores will die.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011978	No one will be trying this type of horrible experiment anymore.{nl}If they do, my brother and I are here to stop them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011979	We need to disable this barrier so my brother and I can escape...{nl}But no matter how hard I try, it won't open.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011980	There has to be a way to free my brother around here.{nl}Will you look for it?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011981	We came to the Croa Village for Rose; a little more and the demons would've caught us.{nl}You would think they'd all gone to Orsha because of that migration order... Isn't it?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011982	Where are all the people of Rose's village?{nl}She's been so worried...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011983	The fear I felt being chased by the demons...{nl}It's not something I ever want to go through again. Not after Medzio Diena.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011990	Laswi is smart, finding my colleagues won't be a problem.{nl}I hope they're hiding somewhere safe...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011991	We should go back with Rose now... But she's being so stubborn. {nl}Not even Goddess Gabija would make her change her mind.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011993	Those demons just now... They were coming to take Tess, weren't they?

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011995	Every single one of the village residents was taken.{nl}What... What do I do now...?

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_011997	It seems the bones are fine but...{nl}We should go somewhere safe after getting some rest.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012002	I am slowly losing consciousness...{nl}Why are the goddesses still not answering to me...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012003	It is all thanks to you.{nl}Being able to meet Rose who is safe... all thanks to you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012004	I didn't even dare to hope... that I would be able to meet Rose again.{nl}I had merely hoped that she would be spared from being used in the wizard's plans... {nl}This all seems like a dream.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012010	The Novaha Monastery is just on the other side of the Dadan Jungle.{nl}But we are facing the demons... We can't just rush in without any preparation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012011	Spores and ferns...{nl}If there is anything I've learned as a traveling merchant, {nl}it's to take things slowly instead of rushing onwards.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012012	We don't even know what a 'Kruvina' is.{nl}I am sure that stopping the demons will lead to us saving the townfolk and my brother as well.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012021	What happened to the seal?{nl}I don't know how many times I prayed for you to be safe.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012022	He made people lose their lives by giving them rubbish crystals in the first place. {nl}It gets even more ridiculous. Now he is telling us to ask the dead.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012023	I dislike the idea of begging Erikas for help again...{nl}I will be able to find my sleeping vassals if only you {nl}will collect Mochia Stems from the Slopes of Mochia.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012025	Mochia Stems have the power to guide the memories of the deceased.{nl}I will fill the power of Scroll of the Dead into this.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012028	But there are too many monsters...{nl}I don't know if we can make it safely to Irmantas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012029	I think I will faint if I have to travel any further.{nl}I seem to be hearing... the voice of the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012030	Still... We can't stop here.{nl}I will try to muster what strength I have left.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012031	Deliver this letter and Ignas' plot to Irmantas.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012032	I will burden Alina's share of upholding Lydia Schaffen's will as well.{nl}I will find a way to survive and reach Orsha no matter what!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012033	I... wish to repay you for protecting us to the end.{nl}I am sure that Alina and Lydia Schaffen will want that as well.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012034	This should be enough...{nl}Now I will take back my shattered soul!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012035	Agatas honored his side of the contract.{nl}Now I will leave him and start on a journey of revenge.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012036	Placed the spirit separation potion in Agatas' pocket.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012037	I don't really know where he has gone either.{nl}I think Brophen followed the village elder to the Malkos Felled Area, maybe he might know?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012038	Anyways, I want to thank you in the meantime.{nl}I hope that the grace of the goddesses will bless you on your travels.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012039	Thank you so much for protecting the townfolk on the journey here.{nl}They are all grateful for your kindness.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012040	I wonder how many migration orders Orsha issued...{nl}I don't know how much longer we will have to just wait here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012041	I don't know how many times you've protected our townsfolk on the way here...{nl}Yet we receive your help again. Thank you so much.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012042	By the way, how are the nightmares now?{nl}How about consulting the bishop in Orsha when you get there?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012043	Orsha's lord should have issued the migration orders sooner.{nl}There were too many casualties. Way too many...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012044	It is in times like this when you need something to have faith in...{nl}Where have the goddesses gone to...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012045	They said that the lord would send soldiers and officials to help if we managed to get here...{nl}I don't see any sign of them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012046	There were orders issued by the lord.{nl}Refugees from the west of Orsha are to wait here at Lemprasa Pond.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012047	Mayor Romanas?{nl}I'm not sure. I did see Layla accompanying him a while ago.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012048	Hmm? Do you hear something strange?{nl}I think something is coming this way...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012049	Some say that the goddesses simply abandoned us...{nl}I am sure that there must be a reason.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012050	I still have faith because the Goddess Statues shine as if they are acknowledging your prayers.{nl}That is what is upholding my faith.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012051	I would have stayed in my hometown if I knew that this is what was going happen, {nl}whether it be migration orders or not.{nl}It couldn't have been worse than the situation we're in now.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012052	Officer Lutas is saying that there are too many refugees to let them all into Orsha.{nl}That's why they've made and are offering aid to several smaller refugee camps near Orsha.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012053	Aid... I don't know if you can call this proper aid.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012054	Four years have passed since Medzio Diena, but the reconstruction of Orsha is still underway.{nl}There are some refugees that are disappointed when they see Orsha...{nl}But it should still be better than other places in the world.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012055	A person with your skills is welcome to enter Orsha at once.{nl}Go to the castle next to the Central Plaza if you wish to meet the lord.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012056	Thank you so much for saving me!{nl}Forget about Orsha, I almost... Whew...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012057	You helped us from the monsters on the way here as well.{nl}Even though the goddesses are nowhere to be seen, {nl}I can't help but think that they are still somewhere when I look at you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012058	I don't know what the lord is thinking, making us wait in such a dangerous place.{nl}I'm going to move somewhere else as soon as my family gets here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012059	By the way, didn't you just level up while fighting those Kepas?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012060	I've heard something from a friend that enlisted a while ago...{nl}He said that you can choose one Status Point and grow stronger when you level up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012061	Why don't you try it out?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012062	I caught a glimpse of Orsha as we were traveling up the slope a while ago...{nl}There is no sign of the enormous castle walls I remember from when I was young, {nl}and it is covered by trees the size of houses.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012063	I thought it would be safe with the migration orders and all, but I don't know.{nl}Do you think it will be okay?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012064	You should give some serious thought on where you want to focus on from now on.{nl}It is no easy choice.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012065	That's strange.{nl}An abundance of evidence, but not one core piece.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012066	I've heard that Bishop Urbonas made it safely back to Orsha.{nl}But we still have something to deal with before we go. {nl}I am talking about the demons of course.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012067	I heard that you played a large role.{nl}Of course, the lord wouldn't have sent you if you weren't any good.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012068	Of course the refugee situation in Orsha is important...{nl}There will be mass confusion if word of what we are doing now gets out.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012069	Cleaning up the mess is part of our job as well.{nl}Besides, we are barely handling the influx of refugees into Orsha, {nl}we won't be able to handle demons at the same time.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012070	That is a superb choice.{nl}You will be able to choose what Status you want to enhance{nl}by allocating points every time you level up from now on.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012071	It is difficult to revert decisions after allocating a Status Point...{nl}So I imagine that choosing wisely is important.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012072	I've heard of your deeds. Talk about impressive.{nl}I'm not saying that I am not just a tiny bit jealous, {nl}but you can't work in Intelligence Command if you pay too much attention to contribution levels.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012073	I may simply be working for the lord of Orsha for the money...{nl}But I am fully aware of how important the current situation is.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012074	I don't know if I am willing to keep working as a Tracer after this.{nl}I mean, demons...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012075	I've heard that you found the person that we failed to find.{nl}I don't know if I have ever been more embarrassed as a Tracer before.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012076	There are so many monsters even near Orsha...{nl}Can you imagine what it is like further away?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012077	Oh yes, you mentioned that you were looking for Mayor Romanas didn't you?{nl}The mayor headed towards the Temporary Settler Camp with Layla a while ago.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012078	Could you possibly give this Grass Leaf Ointment to Layla?{nl}My legs are still shaking after that ordeal...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012079	Tracking has never been this hard before.{nl}There are monsters near Orsha that I have never even seen before.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012080	Impressive. You saved the bishop...{nl}Well, I at least get some satisfaction in knowing that I was right.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012081	You know, I didn't nearly give you enough credit when I first saw you...{nl}I guess the lord has a better eye for talent than I do.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012082	I can't believe I left Priest Pranas behind even if I was frightened by the demon...{nl}I don't deserve to be called a tracer.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012083	I thought that it was impressive enough that you could take on that demon...{nl}The fact that you saved Bishop Urbonas as well is simply outstanding.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012084	These are just some rumors that I heard on the way here.{nl}They say that the towns on the far side of the river are also lying in ruins because of monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012085	We would have been in a lot of trouble as well if the lord hadn't issued the migration orders.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012086	I'd like to work with you again in the future.{nl}If I happen to get the chance to do so.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012087	I am so glad that Priest Pranas is safe.{nl}Rewards aside, I didn't think that surviving an encounter {nl}with such a powerful demon would have been possible.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012088	You literally saved my live.{nl}I wouldn't have been able to go anywhere near Orsha if you hadn't saved Priest Pranas.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012089	Please don't tell anyone about the investigations that we are conducting here.{nl}There will be an uproar if the refugees coming to Orsha find out.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012090	This is... Did Brophen ask you to give this to me?{nl}Thank you very much.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012091	Mayor Romanas went ahead towards the Temporary Settler Camp.{nl}I was here waiting for Brophen.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012092	Oh, by the way, I've overheard Brophen going on about this.{nl}Have you heard about Skill Points?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012093	I've heard that you can use them to learn new skills or enhance skills you've already learned.{nl}I'm sure it will help you in combat if you carefully choose what to invest in.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012094	You've begun to become quite a celebrity.{nl}Rumors about you that were whispered outside the city can now be heard everywhere.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012095	Thanks to you, we have Bishop Urbonas back...{nl}Now all that is left is to take care of the remaining demons, {nl}but why are they suddenly appearing all over the place?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012096	I've heard that you were the person who found Bishop Urbonas.{nl}I'm glad that all ended well, but my job is far from over...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012097	I didn't pay too much attention to the tall tales from outside the walls...{nl}But you seem to be the real deal.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012098	I was wondering who it was that saved Bishop Urbonas...{nl}It was you! Goodness...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012099	Medzio Diena, monsters, the influx of refugees, and the disappearance of Bishop Urbonas...{nl}I feel as if there is more to come. In a bad way.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012100	Priest Pranas seems to have recovered quickly...{nl}But the air still seems to be heavy despite the cursed idol being destroyed.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012101	Rescuing Bishop Urbonas is only one of my missions.{nl}But the pressure that I am feeling... It's overwhelming.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012102	Oh good, you're here.{nl}We're thankful for the fair bit of trouble you've gone through to get us here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012103	So, are the nightmares still giving you trouble?{nl}That's a shame. I wish there was something I could do for the person I owe so much...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012104	Of course, how could I have forgotten. {nl}How about meeting Bishop Urbonas of Orsha?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012105	I've heard that he is the most respected cleric from around these parts.{nl}I'm sure he'll be able to resolve your nightmares.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012106	From what I've heard... {nl}They are letting skilled individuals like yourself get into Orsha faster.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012107	As it so happens, Officer Lutas wants to meet you anyway,{nl}so why don't you meet him at the Orsha Migration Office?{nl}I've been singing your praise to him for a while now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012108	By the way, I would appreciate it if you could help a few refugees if it isn't too much of a bother.{nl}There are many who are just too kind-hearted to ask anyone for help. {nl}I'm sure they would all greatly appreciate it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012109	Medzio Diena... It's already been four years.{nl}I did not see it in person, but they say that a giant tree {nl}suddenly rose out of the ground in the capital.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012110	The tree was so enormous that many cities in the kingdom, {nl}not to mention the capital, were destroyed by the tree's roots.{nl}Many people were injured or killed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012111	But that was far from the end...{nl}Docile monsters became violent, and some swelled in numbers at a ridiculous rate.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012112	The scariest part is that the demons began to appear.{nl}Demons that have lain dormant thanks to the goddesses began to appear all over the kingdom.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012113	The goddesses... They didn't answer either.{nl}Even before Medzio Diena, they had started to be unresponsive one by one... But still...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012114	Allow me to stop here as these are painful memories for me. {nl}Things are pretty grim these days as well, but I really do not wish to relive that fateful day.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012115	What a gruesome sight.{nl}I've heard that there is not a place untouched by the roots and monsters after Medzio Diena.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012116	Orsha and Klaipeda are the only cities around that you could say still stand.{nl}Times like these make people look around for things to depend on, {nl}but the goddesses are nowhere to be seen...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012117	Oh my, look at how time flies. It's about time I went off to see the soldiers.{nl}Why don't you go see Officer Lutas if you wish to meet the bishop of Orsha.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012118	The cursed idol or whatever it is is really unsettling.{nl}It's going to take a while for me to recuperate...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012119	Pranas seems to be heading straight down to the 2nd floor after suffering from the cursed idol.{nl}I guess not anyone can become a priest...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012120	Don't mind me, the orders...{nl}We must find it before Marnox gets his hands on it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012121	I've heard that there is someone helping the refugees, it must have been you!{nl}I thank you on behalf of our lord.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012122	So... You're planning on stopping by at Orsha?{nl}As you can see, there are too many refugees... {nl}I have my hands completely full.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012123	I understand that the refugees have complaints about having to{nl}abandon their hometowns because of the migration orders...{nl}I'm sure the lord wouldn't have issued such orders unless she had no choice.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012124	It's not like the military and adminsitration of Orsha {nl}faired any better than the other cities on Medzio Diena. {nl}We've worked hard to get back to this state. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012125	It won't be easy to send officials or troops to other regions for at least a few years.{nl}Especially since the demons keep heading south...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012126	That's why the lord decided that the best course of action was to gather everyone at Orsha.{nl}Even if it means causing all this chaos.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012127	The reconstruction of Orsha is still ongoing.{nl}It's not possible to let all the refugees who arrive enter Orsha due to some complications.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012128	I'm sorry, but I will get to you once these people have been processed.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012129	It's a relief knowing that Irma is safe.{nl}I think... I need to rest a little...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012130	I am thankful that we were able to recover the orders...{nl}But I sincerely doubt that this is the end.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012131	I assume that what is written in there signals the start of a new catastrophe to come.{nl}May the goddesses have mercy on Orsha...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012132	Rumors that the villages on the other side of mountains and {nl}rivers had been destroyed by monsters spread like wildfire.{nl}I tried calming the people thinking that the soldiers of Orsha would come to help but...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012133	The neighboring village had been ransacked.{nl}I could not help but think that the even the goddesses had forsaken us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012134	Thankfully, migration orders were issued to the surviving villages, but it was too late for many. {nl}They should have been issued sooner...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012135	Not enough manpower, too many refugees...{nl}Sometimes I think it might be easier fighting monsters like the soldiers.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012136	I wish I could accommodate you sooner... But look at it from my perspective.{nl}If I let you in before the people that have been waiting over there, there'll be an uproar.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012137	You can enter Orsha without being processed.{nl}But the reason they are all waiting over here is because of the refugee qualification.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012138	You can't recieve any support from Orsha without having a refugee status.{nl}They know that they will all starve without support so that's why they're all waiting.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012139	That was a close call, since the soldiers were all in the middle of changing shifts.{nl}If it wasn't for you, that monster would have charged straight towards Orsha.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012140	I take back what I said earlier about fighting monsters like the soldiers.{nl}I wouldn't be able to survive fights with those monsters {nl}even if the goddesses blessed me with a few to spare.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012141	I guess it'll be slow around here for a while since everyone ran off...{nl}Besides, a person with your skills is always welcome in Orsha.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012142	By the way, the lord of Orsha is gathering talented people.{nl}I think she's offering jobs, so why don't you stop by if you aren't in a hurry?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012143	The lord is a strong willed and level-headed person.{nl}Go to the castle next to the Central Plaza if you wish to meet her.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012144	Bishop Urbonas?{nl}Why are you looking for him?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012145	I don't know... I haven't seen him for a couple of days.{nl}Why don't you try meeting the lord first since they are close?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012146	Most refugees here haven't been to Orsha before in their life.{nl}That's why most of them would have thought that they would {nl}be protected by the massive castle they've heard rumors about...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012147	I'm sure you'll notice when you enter, but much has changed since Medzio Diena...{nl}It's a pity sight for all the refugees that make it here just on the basis of the migration orders.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012148	Greetings.{nl}I am the ruler of Orsha, Inesa Hamondale.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012149	I've heard some rumors about a traveler recently.{nl}Said traveler has been saving villagers not even the kingdom nor the lord could protect.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012150	There are even some that say that the traveler was sent by the goddesses.{nl}I have heard that the traveler... is you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012151	It was a mess four years ago on Medzio Diena.{nl}A gigantic tree sprouting up from beneath the capital... Monsters attacking villages...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012152	Even the king and his army did not help us with the world in such disarray.{nl}But I've heard that someone still had it in them to help us refugees, it's you isn't it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012153	I know it's not much... {nl}But I wanted to thank you somehow.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012154	Please gather some Red Leaves by catching Leaf Bugs at Ziedo Pond. {nl}I'll make you some potions that work well on wounds.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012155	I'm not from Mayor Romanas' village.{nl}I lived in a nearby village that was destroyed not long ago.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012156	The hunters warned us that monsters were heading our way... {nl}But the lord never sent any soldiers.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012157	I barely made it away from my hometown when I heard {nl}that the lord finally issued the Orsha migration orders.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012158	It would have made a lot of difference if the orders had been issued sooner...{nl}Not only are the goddesses missing, now I've lost my home and fields as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012159	How are we supposed to live now...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012160	Here you go, take this potion.{nl}It works wonders on wounds.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012161	Thank you so much for helping the refugees.{nl}I feel like we can depend on you more than the missing goddesses...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012162	It was okay back then because my town was far from the capital.{nl}Now... I don't think I will be able to go back.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012163	To live holed up inside Orsha's castle walls that have been destroyed by roots...{nl}Or wait out here where there are swarms of monsters...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012164	It's a hard life either way.{nl}I'd rather be back home...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012165	I'm getting nervous since nobody is in sight when they should be here by now.{nl}You don't think they've all entered Orsha without me, do you?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012166	The discontent of the refugees is mounting due to the sudden nature of the migration orders.{nl}Due to lack of facilities, long processing times... Even I would be angry.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012167	What can we do though. {nl}It may have been too late, but this is the best we can do...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012168	Survivors from other villages are trickling towards this place.{nl}Everybody is worn out from fleeing day and night without a proper rest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012169	They are all friendly faces... {nl}Yet all I can do is to craft stamina pills for them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012170	Could you gather some Rampar Mucus from Chinency near Ziedo Pond?{nl}That's the main material for crafting the pills.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012171	All I can see in the eyes of people coming here is wariness and fear.{nl}To make matters worse, the goddesses are not responding either.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012172	What would you think if you were the mayor?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012173	Whew... Never mind. It was just the complaints of an old man.{nl}I am more worried about our young lord...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012174	Sometimes I wonder if it would have been better if {nl}the migration orders had been issued on Medzio Diena.{nl}It's being delayed because they're haphazardly trying to solve problems four years too late.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012175	I'm sure the lord had her reasons, but I wonder {nl}why she didn't issue the migration orders sooner.{nl}Maybe the messenger was being lazy?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012176	There is so much I want to ask if I ever get to meet the lord.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012177	This should be enough Rampar Mucus.{nl}Here, you should take some for yourself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012178	You can recover Stamina from Tree Root Crystals or by resting.{nl}But you won't have time for that when you are being chased by monsters, will you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012179	These Stamina pills will be worth their weight in gold at times like that.{nl}I'll pray for the goddesses' blessings upon you!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012180	Did you by any chance see some people wondering nearby?{nl}The villagers from my town all got separated because we ran into some monsters...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012181	They should still be on their way here since the only safe place is Orsha...{nl}I don't know why they're not here already. I'm worried that they are perhaps lost in the forest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012182	I'm sorry, but could you by any chance light a campfire on Adata Highway?{nl}It's for people to see the smoke and come towards it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012183	I've met only a few people here.{nl}I don't know where all the others may have gone...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012184	Thank you so much for helping out.{nl}I just hope that they'll notice the smoke...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012185	I think the smoke is too faint...{nl}Those campfires may be too small to be noticed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012186	We need a larger fire. A very large fire.{nl}Maybe the firewood that Official Lutas prepared on Adata Highway may be good enough.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012187	I've already received permission to use it as well.{nl}Well, what are you waiting for?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012188	Official Lutas says that there are too many refugees to simply allow them entrance into Orsha.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012189	That's why they've created smaller refugee camps near Orsha and are supplying them there.{nl}The firewood on Adata Highway was also supposed to be used in that fashion.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012190	I heard something loud... {nl}What do you think happened?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012191	Oh my, a big monster?{nl}I'm so sorry that I dragged you into something like this...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012192	The smoke is noticeable thanks to your efforts, but this is terrible.{nl}The fact that all we can do is wait here when such dangerous monsters are appearing...{nl}It makes no sense!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012193	I haven't seen you around before, are you another one of those useless officials from Orsha?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012194	You're not?{nl}Oh... My apologies.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012195	I came from a place near the southern seashore.{nl}My house was unscathed, but I left because they said that they would protect us if we came to Orsha...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012196	But as you can see, all that's prepared for us are houses unfit for people and a few campfires.{nl}There aren't even enough troops or officials here to help us either.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012197	We've started to use what the previous inhabitants left behind since there is a shortage of pretty much everything.{nl}There are monsters everywhere else you see.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012198	Don't you think it's miserable?{nl}There seem to be a lot of useful things in the Lumberjack Cabin, so it's a shame we can't go and get them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012199	It's not like the Southern Seashore is damage free.{nl}The massive fruits that came from upstream have totally ruined the fishing nets.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012200	I gazed vacantly at the shore covered in the colorful juice from all those fruits..{nl}They all began rotting not too long afterwards. Ugh..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012201	It was still managable since there weren't any monsters though.{nl}I don't know if that's still the case.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012202	Wow, these will come in handy.{nl}You've earned my thanks in many more ways than those officials ever will.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012203	You must not be from around these parts.{nl}People from around here don't wear clothes like that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012204	If you're a traveler... {nl}How about worshiping the Statue of Goddess Zemyna at Randoluma Rest Place?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012205	Goddess Zemyna administers the Earth.{nl}She also looks after travelers on their journeys.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012206	Of course, the goddesses haven't been answering our prayers for a while...{nl}But the statues still sparkle brightly when we pray to them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012207	I can't recall the exact date but... {nl}Yes. It must have been shortly before Medzio Diena.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012208	There used to always be an answer when we prayed to the goddesses,{nl}but the prayers began to be unanswered.{nl}There aren't any people that claim to have seen the goddesses after that either.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012209	The first goddess to stop answering was Goddess Gabija.{nl}This was probably around the time of my grandfather's grandfather.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012210	Then Goddess Zemyna, Ausrine, and Vakarine fell silent...{nl}Now there's nobody left.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012211	But I still believe that the goddesses have not forsaken us.{nl}There must be some reason they aren't answering.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012212	I don't know who sculpted all those goddess statues either.{nl}From what I've heard, they've been around for a long time...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012213	With the world in the state that it is there are some that are in ruin {nl}or have become habitats for monsters...{nl}In some cases, monsters are even indwelling in the statues.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012214	Of course, it's up to you if you believe it or not.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012215	Have you been to Randoluma Rest Place by any chance?{nl}A soldier from Orsha said that he'd be back for us if we wait there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012216	I don't know what the Orsha soldiers are thinking.{nl}We can't get there because of the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012217	All we know is how to plough fields and cast nets, so what can we do?{nl}So would you mind clearing the monsters from Randoluma Rest Place for us?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012218	I've felt a lot of resentment while abandoning my hometown.{nl}But coming here and seeing the northern villages changed my mind about that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012219	I just hope that the village will be safe until the migration orders are lifted.{nl}You see, the elders are still there because they couldn't bear leaving their hometown.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012220	I can't believe that they told us to gather in a place like that with all those monsters...{nl}The lord clearly didn't think it through.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012221	They're saying that people from my village have arrived at Randoluma Rest Place.{nl}But they've scattered due to the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012222	I'm sure they're trembling in fear out there...{nl}Could you look for them and bring them here after you find them?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012223	Even if Mayor Romanas and the villagers run into trouble,{nl}at least it seems safer here than at Randoluma Rest Place.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012224	I don't know if they have actually thought it through.{nl}It shouldn't be that dangerous if they prepared it for us.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012225	Thank you.{nl}I'll have to ask Mayor Romanas if our villagers can stay as well.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012226	The reason I was looking for skillful people like you...{nl}Well, before we get to the point, let me explain a little about the situation that Orsha is in.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012227	The appearance of Orsha... You must have been shocked as well.{nl}As you can see, Orsha is still being rebuilt.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012228	The entire population of Orsha is being mobilized for the reconstruction,{nl}so we barely have enough soldiers to protect the city.{nl}In other words, we really can't dispatch troops or officials to other regions.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012229	Of course, the monsters don't care about our woes.{nl}The collective damage to the settlers is growing, and there are already several villages that have been destroyed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012230	We are moving all of the surviving settlers to Orsha...{nl}But we don't have the hands, nor the resources, to work out the complaints that are piling up.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012231	That's the short version of the situation... {nl}Now let's get back to the point at hand.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012232	In Orsha, there is a grave matter that can't be announced publicly.{nl}We're turning to you for help since, as I've told you, we are barely holding everything together.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012233	Someone with your skills should be able to take care of this problem.{nl}I know it's a bit sudden to ask of you to help like this, but we're grasping for straws at this point.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012234	You said you're looking for Bishop Urbonas?{nl}Well that makes things easy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012235	What I wish to ask of you is to find Bishop Urbonas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012236	There is a figure that the people of Orsha turn to more than the lord.{nl}That figure is Bishop Urbonas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012237	Bishop Urbonas is the pillar sustaining the people of Orsha at the moment.{nl}That pillar is now missing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012238	I've been asking around to try to figure out what happened, {nl}but it seems as if the priests have all disappeared as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012239	My men are all looking for the whereabouts of Bishop Urbonas...{nl}But it's pretty much a dead-end at this point.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012240	If you're as good as the rumors make you out to be, {nl}you'll have no trouble in finding where Bishop Urbonas is.{nl}Just make sure nobody knows about this... {nl}The lord doesn't want the people being any more agitated than they already are.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012241	Could you ask that person how much longer he's going to make us stand here?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012242	It's been days since we've arrived, and yet we still haven't set foot in Orsha.{nl}Why did they make us travel all the way here just to make us stand around like this?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012243	I'm tired and hungry...{nl}Missing a meal would've been unthinkable back home...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012244	They call us settlers, but we're basically refugees...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012245	The settlers will panic if they find out about this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012246	A few towns have already fallen to monsters because {nl}the migration orders went out later than expected...{nl}So the news of the disappearance of Bishop Urbonas{nl}will most likely spiral things out of control.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012247	One of the priests studying beneath him, Pranas, came back not too long ago.{nl}I've tried to ask him about what happened, but he doesn't seem to know either.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012248	My immediate subordinates and hired trackers are searching the {nl}Woods of the Linked Bridges and Paupys Crossing from top to bottom.{nl}But there hasn't been any headway because of the monsters coming {nl}towards Orsha from all directions.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012249	Even if Irma is still alive, she might suffer a gruesome fate at any moment.{nl}I hope nothing happens to her...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012250	I must find Bishop Urbonas.{nl}The only place the settlers and I can turn to in a world where{nl}even the goddesses aren't answering is Bishop Urbonas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012251	Four years ago during Medzio Diena...{nl}I rose to lordship as I was the only heir after my {nl}father and brother were lost on that fateful day.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012252	Back then, there were only the threats of people trying to manipulate or threaten me...{nl}Bishop Urbonas was the only person that protected me and helped Orsha endure.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012253	First of all, there are reports of demons at the Woods of the Linked Bridges and Paupys Crossing.{nl}Perhaps they have something to do with the disappearance of Bishop Urbonas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012254	An ominous feeling... is tightening around me.{nl}Please find Bishop Urbonas for Orsha and the settlers.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012255	Before you leave, please stop by the Statue of Goddess Ausrine in the Central Plaza.{nl}Goddess Statues will become inseparable guides for your travels in the future.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012256	I've also taken the liberty of preparing a few meager supplies, {nl}so stop by at the Item Merchant to pick them up.{nl}I'll contact you again once you've prepared.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012257	Please keep this a secret.{nl}You must not speak of the disappearance of Bishop Urbonas until this case is solved.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012258	Oh, hello there, welcome. {nl}I've heard that you've saved refugees from danger several times.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012259	The lord have been very pleased because she sent a person to bestow some supplies.{nl}There you go. I'm sure they'll come in handy!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012260	They say that there are barely any intact cities left in the kingdom.{nl}All because of Medzio Diena four years ago... It's a real shame.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012261	You'll need a lot of trivial tools on your travels like potions and such.{nl}Make sure to stop by often since I have the cheapest prices around.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012262	Oh yes, the lord also requested something of Jurus the Accessory Merchant.{nl}Make sure you stop by.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012263	Grandfather says that he doesn't know how many more people Orsha can handle.{nl}There are more travelers flocking here as well since {nl}it's relatively safer than the rest of the kingdom.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012264	It doesn't feel very good even if the store is doing better.{nl}Do you think everyone can be happy if the goddesses return?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012265	Greetings. I have heard of you from the lord.{nl}Things aren't going great but I'll give you this since the lord specially asked for something nice.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012266	Everyone in Orsha is having it rough... {nl}But I feel as if we are getting by thanks to the people {nl}like you that go out of their way to help others.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012267	Oh, yes. The lord was looking for you again.{nl}You should go back to her.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012268	There has just been a report from an agent that was {nl}searching through the Woods of the Linked Bridges.{nl}It says that they've found a clue to the whereabouts of Bishop Urbonas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012269	Priest Pranas was the one who headed the search this time.{nl}He only returned recently after being away for a long time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012270	He has known Bishop Urbonas for a long time, {nl}so I'm sure that he'll be of great help in the search.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012271	Go to Agent Cherasia, one of my immediate subordinates, {nl}who is at the Woods of the Linked Bridges when you're ready.{nl}You'll be able to find out what happened since the report and what they're planning to do next.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012272	I've heard about you from the lord.{nl}Glad to meet you. I'm Cherasia.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012273	I've been searching for clues about the bishop and the priests around here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012274	The other agents are currently disguised as being {nl}out on other assignments for the sake of secrecy.{nl}So I hope you don't do anything rash that will undo all of their efforts.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012275	I'm sure you've heard of Priest Pranas from the lord.{nl}Pranas only recently returned from his asceticism from the north.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012276	He recently found the traces of Priest Irma, one of the bishop's disciples.{nl}There were pieces of what seemed to be Irma's diary ripped apart.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012277	From the way they've been ripped apart... It looks like the monsters did this.{nl}I was left here while Priest Pranas and the rest went to look for more clues.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012278	I've been trying my best to gather the remaining pages from the diary, {nl}but it seems to be a bit too much to do by myself.{nl}You'll have to lend a hand if we want to cover more ground while searching.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012279	It's unnatural for monsters to tear apart something as unattractive as a diary.{nl}My guess is... that somebody did this on purpose.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012280	It's hard to recognize thanks to all the monster saliva...{nl}But it seems as if they were being chased by something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012281	You should hurry.{nl}Take this and go find Agent Moren at Gyvenimo Crossroads.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012282	I'll stay here and try to find any more clues.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012283	I've received word from the lord.{nl}You're the person here to help us right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012284	The journal Cherasia found...{nl}The fact that Irma is being chased most likely means that the bishop is also being chased.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012285	Priest Pranas asked me to check the traces we've found here. {nl}Then he went up with the rest of the trackers.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012286	This is where the bishop and the priests stayed for a while...{nl}The monsters are turning any investigation into a nightmare.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012287	I'd like to ask you to deal with the monsters so that I can get some investigation done. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012288	I think just a bit more will do...{nl}I'm trying my best to get all the evidence I can, so don't worry. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012289	Paper burned by something... There's definitely something written on it.{nl}Why did they only burn some of it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012290	They've covered the campfire with leaves after dousing it.{nl}Not something that you would normally do. It has a great risk of catching fire.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012291	Maybe they did this to try to secretly notify us of something.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012292	)}Cherasia said that Priest Irma was being chased by something?{nl}If so, then these half-burnt notes may have been burned to hide something from her pursuers.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012293	Whatever that may have been, there is a need to check these more thoroughly.{nl}Let me give it a try since it is my expertise after all.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012294	Please look for more clues while I take a look at these.{nl}You may find some more burnt notes if you go through all of the smoking leaves around here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012295	)}There's no way people on the run could have had {nl}the time to make campfires all over the place like this.{nl}Do you think it's part of a charade?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012296	)}Good.{nl}Let's gather the notes and see what's written on them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012297	A revelation?{nl}The bishop of Orsha... Revelator..?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012298	I have no idea what they mean with the 'Revelator'...{nl}Do you know anything about this?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012299	I see you don't have a clue either. Maybe Pranas knows something about this...{nl}Ulysses has gone with Priest Pranas so look for him up north.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012300	By the way, there are also other hired trackers around here besides Pranas and the other agents.{nl}I'd appreciate it if you could help them out as much as you can.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012301	Priest Pranas?{nl}He's gone to Paupys Crossing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012302	He left me in charge of the investigation here with a very concerned look.{nl}He asked me to look for clues about the whereabouts of the priests near Greate Stone Face Hill.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012303	There are definitely traces of someone staying there for a while...{nl}But there are simply too many monsters for me to handle by myself. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012304	I've heard that you're quite good.{nl}Before you head off to Priest Pranas, could you reconnoiter Greate Stone Face Hill?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012305	Revelator? I don't know what you're talking about.{nl}Do you perhaps mean the people like the Bokors or Oracles?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012306	Four years ago, Medzio Diena...{nl}...but that was only the beginning.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012307	It was the beginning of a whole new calamity.{nl}We've been preparing ourselves for hundreds of years now, and we will finish our mission.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012308	I only hope that Orsha will be safe until my priests and I can finish our mission...{nl}...sent by the goddess...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012309	(You cannot recognize any more information.){nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012310	A Minotaur... Are you telling me that there are demons?{nl}By the goddesses, demons this close to Orsha?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012311	The bishop's diary? What are you talking about? {nl}It seems as if I am not the only person that thinks something dangerous is afoot...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012312	Forget about me, you should head to Paupys Crossing as quickly as you can.{nl}My friend Talbasi is searching that region with Priest Pranas, so you should look for Talbasi.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012313	You're the person that the lord's messenger told us about.{nl}How is the search in the Woods of the Linked Bridges going?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012314	Demons appearing this close to Orsha is no small incident.{nl}There have never been any demons even if half of Orsha had been destroyed on Medzio Diena.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012315	My mother will have a heart attack if she ever finds out that I'm tracking demons...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012316	The monsters are pouring in... There's not enough manpower...{nl}They don't want to give us a break do they?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012317	Oh, I'm helping behind the scenes to make it easier for the others.{nl}I'm dealing with monsters in Zbuka Inner Court, but they just keep coming and tired me out.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012318	Eh, you're really going to help?{nl}For once I'm the one being helped instead and can't help out too.{nl}I think you really are sent by the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012319	I'll let you deal with the monsters in Zbuka Inner Court while I rest a little.{nl}They are more vicious than they look, so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012320	There's a limit to what one can do alone.{nl}At this rate, I wonder if an army might be more suited to dealing with this...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012321	As you know...{nl}There are barely enough soldiers in Orsha to protect the settlers.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012322	It's less of a hassle to deal with two monsters than three of them, {nl}and one monster is easier than two. Thank you so much.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012323	The soldiers took care of most of the monsters heading towards Orsha but...{nl}They've collected them and piled them together on those carts.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012324	It stinks, and even more monsters have come to run amok since they've been left like that.{nl}Sorry, but could you possibly burn those carts down while I rest a little?{nl}  
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012325	Forget the monsters going wild because of the stench, {nl}the fact that they're gathering near Orsha is definitely not natural.{nl}I don't know why they are acting like that. {nl}Do you think there may be demons somewhere?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012326	At least I won't be responsible for any more monsters in my area for a while.{nl}Thank you for helping out.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012327	Hey there, how's it going? {nl}It appears that you've also received requests from that person over there...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012328	Do you want something really useful? It's a Monster Stimulant.{nl}Monsters sprayed with it will become hostile and attack other nearby monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012329	Why don't you give it a try?{nl}It will let you pass on some of the more irksome work.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012330	Medzio Diena is a terrible memory for everyone.{nl}My hometown had been destroyed on that fateful day,{nl}and I'm living off these odd jobs in Orsha.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012331	What do you think? Isn't it really effective?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012332	I dreamt of becoming an alchemist before all of this happened.{nl}I only learned it by watching over the shoulders of others so this is actually a failure,{nl}but I guess it's all good if you can find a use for it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012333	What in the world... I've never seen anything like it.{nl}I went up Bonan Forest Road because it felt as if the monsters were pouring out from there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012334	There was a monster that I'd never seen before.{nl}It even made a nest for itself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012335	I was so startled that I ran away... Can't you do something about it?{nl}I'm sure that it'll threaten Orsha if we just leave it there.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012336	If you really don't mind, please deal with the monster on Bonan Forest Road.{nl}There's nothing good that could come from leaving monsters there anyways.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012337	I would have tried to do something myself if it was just a few monsters, {nl}but something of that size...{nl}Just run if you think it's too much for you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012338	You burned the nest to the ground? {nl}A wise decision!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012339	The reason monsters kept pouring out from Bonan Forest Road is probably because of that one.{nl}There are even monsters I'm seeing for the first time since the surrounding areas are all forests.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012340	You've found the journals of Priest Irma and the bishop?{nl}Hm... There are too many parts that I can't get my head around.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012341	If they were merely being pursued, they could have just escaped to Orsha.{nl}Yet they went through the trouble of leaving behind pieces of their journals while disappearing somewhere else.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012342	It could be... That they were threatened...{nl}Or they had a mission that they had to complete even though they were being pursued?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012343	A mission... I've been looking for traces of Priest Gelija.{nl}I cannot make out exactly what is written in the notes left by Gelija either{nl}since they are only partially recognizable due to the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012344	Priest Pranas said that finding traces of Priest Gelija is {nl}very important because of the priest's thorough nature.{nl}I also think that we'll be able to narrow down our search {nl}if we can find all of the clues left by Gelija.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012345	I'll look over here. {nl}How about you look for clues that the monsters may have?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012346	I'm sure that there is some crucial evidence in those notes.{nl}It is common for people on the run to leave clues behind so that others will find them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012347	I was trying to not care too much for Orsha as long as I got paid properly.{nl}But seeing the demons made me think about my{nl}hometown and how it was razed to the ground...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012348	Thank you.{nl}It's not all recognizable since they're all ripped apart, but I can sort of make sense of it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012349	Demons are hiding in the forest waiting to attack us.{nl}A few of us were separated while running away. We... decided to group up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012350	Oh my, there should be a location of where they were going to group up...{nl}But that part is completely missing.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012351	It seems certain that the priests decided to group up somewhere.{nl}Letting Priest Pranas know immediately is fine, {nl}but acquiring more definite information would be better.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012352	I'll keep looking for clues here, you go on to Paslaptis Hideout.{nl}It's only recently been found, and there are reports that the campfires are still warm.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012353	Even a small clue will be a big help in the search.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012354	Report to Larena under the watchtower when you've finished your investigation.{nl}She's second to none when it comes to finding people, {nl}so I'm sure she will manage to find some definitive evidence.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012355	It was the demons that destroyed my hometown, not monsters.{nl}Their brutality... Geez, I don't even want to think of it again.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012356	If the whereabouts of the priests really has to do with demons...{nl}I'm sorry, but I don't think that we'll be able to see them ever again.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012357	It must be you. {nl}The person the lord sent.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012358	You said that there are only traces of hurried movements in Paslaptis Hideout, correct?{nl}That there was a note saying that they decided to group up somewhere.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012359	I think that the reason they couldn't return to Orsha at once... Hm...{nl}I think it was because they had a mission more than merely being pursued or threatened.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012360	Maybe that's why Jolly is so excited...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012361	Oh, this is Jolly by the way. {nl}He's Bishop Urbonas' dog.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012362	I thought that Jolly would be able to find the priests fast since he was adored by all of them.{nl}But it's hard for him to find a scent with all this rain pouring down.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012363	I have to go back Orsha to report to the lord after meeting with a messenger.{nl}Why don't you take Jolly out for a walk?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012364	I wish we had such a friend to work with.{nl}Cute, loving... and best of all, a great tracker.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012365	Did Jolly find something?{nl}It seems as if the bishop's group was near here after all.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012366	Wait a second.{nl}I thought I heard a faint scream from up there...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012367	This doesn't feel right.{nl}You see, Priest Pranas' group went towards Gatves Highway.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012368	They're all more than capable of looking after themselves, but still...{nl}Would you mind going to Gatves Highway just in case?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012369	We are saved! Are you our backup?{nl}About Priest Pranas... He hasn't been able to make it out of Groundsle Hill!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012370	I'm not a fighter, so I'll only be more of a burden if I tag along.{nl}Go after him quickly, please.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012371	We should have increased the number of guards.{nl}I swear that this is the strongest demon I've seen since Medzio Diena!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012372	All we could do once we made eye contact was to run.{nl}Priest Pranas will be in a lot of danger at this rate!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012373	There was nothing we could do.{nl}Please save Priest Pranas before it is too late!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012374	Whoever you are... I thank you for saving me from the bottom of my heart.{nl}Could I perhaps know how you came here, or at least know your name?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012375	Oh, you've been sent by the lord.{nl}Then you must already know that the bishop is missing...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012376	I was trying to deal quickly with a few demons roaming about and investigate the campsite...{nl}But then, we suddenly found their leader...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012377	I... I can't keep holding on.{nl}Please... Search the campsite...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012378	I'm sure we'll clear things out...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012379	Come to Orsha if you find something.{nl}I'll leave the rest up to you...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012380	There is just too much that I cannot comprehend.{nl}I'm just a hired hand trying not to care about Orsha... {nl}But it feels like my loss.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012381	I brought Jolly because I thought he may be able to find clues without trouble...{nl}But the rain doesn't seem like it's going to end any time soon.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012382	A demon that powerful... I've never seen anything like it.{nl}It almost makes me want to quit my job.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012383	Thank you for saving my life back there.{nl}My wounds seem to be a bit more bearable since I've rested a little.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012384	By the way, have you managed to find something?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012385	Must be filled
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012386	There are a lot of disgusting monsters around here.{nl}No wonder nothing can be achieved in this state.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012387	If you have some spare time, could you deal with some of the monsters around here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012388	It wasn't going great even before the monsters started interrupting my work.{nl}It was such a wonderful day until it began raining...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012389	You've taken care of that?{nl}I envy your skills. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012390	There, now I'll get to get back to my work.{nl}Thanks a lot.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012391	I've never heard of demons being spotted anywhere near Orsha before...{nl}All of a sudden, demons appear and they're poking around this place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012392	They've made a bunch of magic circles near Naudingas Felled Area.{nl}I don't know why they've done that but it can't be a good thing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012393	It's not my responsibility, but I do think that it is better to be safe than sorry.{nl}Could you take care of the magic circles at Naudingas Felled Area?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012394	I've been here to survey the land because of the refugee problem.{nl}I don't remember seeing any demons back then... What is going on?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012395	What purpose do the magic circles serve?{nl}I don't think there have been any incident reports yet...{nl}We'll have to wait and see.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012396	There is a lot of nonsense going on because all reports of the area are labeled as classified.{nl}I mean, they're planning on making a refugee camp near Deer Hooves Lot.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012397	Even if the refugees coming here are supposed to be from a village famed for mercenaries.{nl}What are they thinking? Saying that they'll be able to fend for themselves{nl}if we give them houses... There are demons everywhere...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012398	They want a report on whether the monsters here {nl}are weak enough for the mercenaries to handle or not.{nl}I used to be a paper pusher, what am I supposed to do?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012399	I've heard that you're quite skilled.{nl}I can't fake a report, so how about checking Deer Hooves Lot for me?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012400	If they're going to keep the investigations a secret, they should at least write a line and keep to it.{nl}How much more unlucky can I get? I haven't held a sword since training camp...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012401	You're saying that there was an enormous monster at the camp?{nl}I haven't seen it myself, but we can't make people stay in places like that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012402	Right?{nl}I'll take your word for it and put it in my report. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012403	This is just wrong.{nl}I came here as a surveyor, not to fight monsters like the trackers. {nl}That's too much for me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012404	"The monsters may have become more violent because of the demons, so gather some monster blood."{nl}...Are you kidding me?{nl}Could you help me out? You'd literally be saving my life.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012405	By the goddesses, thank you so much.{nl}Just gather some blood from the monsters at Rohonsa Cliff.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012406	I'm not a coward.{nl}I just know what I can and can't do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012407	My skills aren't with a sword or spear, they're honed with a pen and stamps...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012408	What is this disgusting stench?{nl}I don't know how they could have ordered me to collect this stuff.{nl}They know very well that it would have been impossible...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012409	Thankfully, Priest Pranas is safe... Now we can afford to worry about ourselves.{nl}Having ten lives wouldn't be enough if we stay around here for too long.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012410	Sendal and I have hurt our legs and there's no telling {nl}when monsters or demons will come after us...{nl}There's nobody but you to ask for help around here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012411	Could you deal with the monsters around here until we gain our strength again?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012412	I should have known there was a reason to pay so much.{nl}I would have turned down the offer if I knew it was that dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012413	If you hadn't help out, I would have been limping along until they got me.{nl}Thank you so much.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012414	Oh... Whoops.{nl}By any chance have you seen some bags or packages around here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012415	I had all of my potions and food in there...{nl}With my legs in my current state, you're the only person I can ask for help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012416	They shouldn't be far since they weight quite a bit.{nl}I know it may be a bit rude, but could you look for our luggage?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012417	Maybe some monsters have gotten hold of it. This just keeps getting worse.{nl}They're quite heavy so they shouldn't be too far away.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012418	Thank you so much! {nl}They're not in perfect shape, but I'm just glad to have at least some of them back.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012419	This seems to be... a chest.{nl}There's a seal, but it's familiar to priests. Let's open it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012420	It contains a journal and a map of Ashaq Underground Prison 1F.{nl}I do hope that he's not at Ashaq Underground Prison...{nl}There's something marked on it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012421	The handwriting on this map is most definitely of the bishop.{nl}Even though it is written in a language that ordinary people can't read.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012422	I can only translate a part of it right away, would you like to hear it?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012423	"...Once the waves of disaster wash across...{nl}The stranger arranged by the goddess shall seek Orsha dreaming of the catastrophe."{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012424	"Only one of the countless strangers...{nl}To find the one and lead them is our mission."{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012425	"I shall go to the Ashaq Underground Prison with my priests.{nl}There, I shall await the one and only stranger arranged by the goddess..."{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012426	"We started being chased by demons even before we were ready.{nl}There is no time to contact the disciples that aren't nearby Inesa."{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012427	"If someone finds this diary, I beg of you to pass it on to Inesa Hamondale, the lord of Orsha..."{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012428	...That's all it says...{nl}I expected them to be chased by demons, but I didn't know that there was so much more to it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012429	As the journal says, report the contents of the journal to the lord.{nl}We'll also be preparing to go directly to the Ashaq Underground Prison.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012430	There probably won't be a anything more important to Orsha than what we are doing now.{nl}This is worrying. No matter how hard I look, there is one piece of information that is missing...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012431	If only I had a bit more time... I think I can find it.{nl}I'm not in the intelligence business for nothing you know.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012432	It seems that...{nl}I am not the only one that feels something is wrong.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012433	You mean to say that Bishop Urbonas... is being chased by demons?{nl}The Ashaq Underground Prison has been closed off many years ago.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012434	I don't know what he's trying to achieve by hiding there.{nl}I... I don't know what to do...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012435	I'll get ready to go to the Ashaq Underground Prison.{nl}You should hurry and inform the lord of this information!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012436	It will take too long to gather troops to go there.{nl}They may not be of much help with demons since{nl}they only have experience against monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012437	I'm sorry, but could you go to the Ashaq Underground Prison with Priest Pranas?{nl}You're the only one left that I can rely on in this situation...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012438	Whatever it takes, please save Bishop Urbonas.{nl}I, Inesa Hamondale, the lord of Orsha, plead for your assistance.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012439	Bishop Urbonas always preached about the importance of the ties brought by coincidence.{nl}He always said that Goddess Laima would send a Revelator.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012440	Yes. Maybe you...{nl}Maybe you are the Revelator that is mentioned in the {nl}legends passed down among the bishops of Orsha.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012441	The church... Bishop Urbonas has been waiting for a Revelator his whole life.{nl}I will tell you more in detail once you have saved the bishop.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012442	But you must prepare thoroughly no matter how much of a rush you are in, {nl}so please stop by at the Item Merchant.{nl}I have prepared some handy supplies for you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012443	Please forgive me for the fact that I can only help you {nl}in such a fashion even though I am a lord of a terrority.{nl}I shall pray... that the goddesses bless you and Bishop Urbonas.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012444	I've quickly prepared a few things since the lord sent someone over.{nl}This anvil will allow you to enhance your equipment so that they become more effective.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012445	I'd like to give you something more, but this is all I can offer.{nl}I don't know what is happening, but I'm sure you'll pull through.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012446	It is so frustrating. {nl}The fact I'm restricted so much even though I am the lord of Orsha...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012447	Are you coming with us?{nl}Having you with us makes us feel as safe as having a whole army with us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012448	According to the bishop's journal, the demons must be {nl}after the bishop since he's searching for the Revelator.{nl}It would be easier for them to go after the bishop instead {nl}of trying to find the Revelator who might be anybody.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012449	Let's go to the Ashaq Underground Prison whenever you're ready.{nl}Bishop... I pray that the goddesses are giving their blessings...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012450	I'll be right behind you with the trackers.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012451	Let's meet up at Gebene Cliff at Paupys Crossing.{nl}The Ashaq Underground Prison is just ahead of that point.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012452	You're here.{nl}I've gathered the best of the best, but this aura... {nl}It is sinister beyond my knowledge.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012453	Torvana seems to be confident but... This strange aura... {nl}I feel goosebumps all over my body for some reason.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012454	You can place your trust in me, Chaser Torvana!{nl}I'll take care of the demons in one strike, don't you worry.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012455	I can sense the ominous aura streaming out from the direction of the Underground Prison.{nl}We may not be able to make it back out of there once we enter.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012456	But we must save the bishop!{nl}Let's enter the Ashaq Underground Prison if you've finished your preparations.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012457	It feels as if something I can't see is bound to me tightly...{nl}I'm finding it hard... to even breathe.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012458	How are you so unaffected by all this?{nl}Maybe the goddesses are looking after you seeing how indifferent you seem to be to all this...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012459	I've come here a few times when I was an apprentice a very long time ago, {nl}but I've never felt so weighed down like this before.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012460	Let's see... I sense a very strong evil presence towards the Torture Material Room.{nl}I haven't seen that ominous looking fog here before either.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012461	You seem to be in a good condition... {nl}Could you go and check what's happening over at the Torture Material Room for us?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012462	This feels... exactly like a curse.{nl}I've never felt anything quite as vicious before.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012463	What a strange idol.{nl}I've never seen anything like it even in any of the books before.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012464	I am certain that the demons are behind all of this...{nl}But there does not seem to be a way for us to become free of this curse.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012465	Don't worry about me.{nl}I'm second to none when it comes to stamina in the church.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012466	Only you can stand up to Demon Lord Marnox now.{nl}According to the goddesses, only you... the Revelator, can save this world.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012467	I never thought there would be a Cursed Idol here as well...{nl}This aura simply is... unadaptable.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012468	My body... seems to become heavier and heavier.{nl}It's the same with the Chasers as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012469	There's something I want you to do since you seem to be the most uneffected out of all of us.{nl}Do you remember the map of Ashaq Underground Prison 1F {nl}that was in the chest along with his journal?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012470	All we have to rely on now are the points marked on the map.{nl}I don't know what you'll find there, but this is the best we can do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012471	Take the map.{nl}The bishop has definitely left some clues... at the marked locations.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012472	Oh yes, in order to reach those locations, you'll have to take {nl}the rail system meant to transport prisoners.{nl}There's one at the bottom of the stairs just right of here, {nl}but I don't know if it is still functioning.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012473	I shudder to think that I was almost captured by demons.{nl}You... Does the curse not affect you at all?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012474	I wonder what happened to the other priests that ran away from Marnox...{nl}It weighs heavily on my mind.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012475	I will become a more devout priest when we leave this place...{nl}I pray that we will make it out alive...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012476	You... Oh, thank the goddesses! {nl}Does this mean that I may finally accomplish my mission...?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012477	Yes. I am the bishop of Orsha, Urbonas.{nl}Who are you... may I perhaps hear your name?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012478	Of course. Priest Pranas and the lord... {nl}This old man seems to have caused concern for a lot of people.{nl}Could I perhaps interest you into listening to me for a little bit?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012479	Not long ago, Irma discovered strange orders on a demon while up north.{nl}The orders contained terrible plans that would destroy the entire region of Orsha.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012480	But that was not all.{nl}It also contained orders from the Demon Goddess Giltine to get rid of all Revelators.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012481	A Revelator is...{nl}...someone chosen by the goddesses to save this world from the catastrophes to come.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012482	I wanted to give this information to the lord, {nl}but the demons had already started chasing me.{nl}I had no choice but to hide in this prison, {nl}a hideout that I had been preparing for a while.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012483	I could have ran to Orsha, but if I did that, the demons would have followed me there.{nl}Unfortunately, the demon that was after us was not an ordinary demon, but a Demon Lord.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012484	Demon Lord Marnox cursed the entire prison with his idols so that we could not escape.{nl}He also let loose his servants to search for us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012485	We had to make a decision.{nl}First, I hid the Demon Orders in the Penitence Room on the 3rd floor,{nl}so that it would be safe even if I fall.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012486	Then I faced off against Marnox to the best of my abilities, but it was simply not enough.{nl}In the end, Irma was captured by Marnox...{nl}While the other priests were all scattered.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012487	This is the story of what happened up to now.{nl}Until you showed up, I was thinking that I would return to the{nl}arms of the goddess without being able to complete my mission.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012488	But my faith in hope has restored since you've arrived here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012489	Torvana was confident a few minutes ago...{nl}We were chosen because we were supposed to be the best, but look at us now.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012490	Being so confident was a mistake.{nl}My body feels as if it is very heavy... What's happening?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012491	Dispatched officers used to irk us by poking around before the kingdom fell...{nl}I miss those days now.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012492	I feel as if I am experiencing every type of pain I could ever experience in here.{nl}At least I'll have plenty of tales to tell my children when I return.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012493	I remember back home when they were first looking for Chaser volunteers.{nl}I joined up because I trusted Germeja, but the job is more demanding than I thought it would be.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012494	Not to mention extremely dangerous as well.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012495	You've kept dreaming of the Demon Goddess Giltine?{nl}Hmm... Perhaps...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012496	Goddess Laima is responsible for fate and foresight.{nl}You finding me may seem like a sequence of coincidences, {nl}but I am certain that the goddess has led you here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012497	There were orders from Giltine to get rid of 'the Revelator' as well.{nl}I wish to see if perhaps you... since you have been having those dreams... may be 'the Revelator'.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012498	I didn't hear anything about there being demons here.{nl}I didn't think too much of the job since I was told it was an escort mission...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012499	I can't handle things like this, but I'd become a deserter if I run off...{nl}I'm going to seriously consider resigning after this is over.{nl}I don't know what I'd do to make a living though.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012500	All I'm going to do after this is take a break and sleep all day while wrapped in my warm blanket.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012501	I'm certain that the goddess led you here.{nl}All these coincidences are pointing towards you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012502	My goddess, your Revelator is finally here...{nl}The efforts of our church are not in vain...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012503	Only you can stand up to the Demon Lord Marnox now.{nl}According to the goddesses, only you... the Revelator, can save this world.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012504	Please save the priests and Orsha.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012505	The most important part is the invasion plans for Orsha.{nl}I didn't have enough time to fully analyze the orders while on the run from Marnox...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012506	I hid the orders in the Penitence Room on the 3rd floor...{nl}I sealed it as well, but there is no guarantee that Marnox will not be able to break the seal.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012507	Not only that, but even though you are free of the idol's curse, {nl}you will not be able to reach the room if the priests are unable to move.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012508	I wish I could show you the way myself but...{nl}I think that would be a strech due to the wounds I've suffered from Marnox...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012509	This Orb of Return may be able to help us.{nl}We can destroy the idols with it and free the priests from the curse.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012510	Deal with nearby demons to collect evil energy in the orb and destroy the cursed idols!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012511	I will be of no help to you in my current state...{nl}If you destroy all of the idols, please pass on my story to Pranas.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012512	Don't worry about me and look for the Demon Orders first.{nl}We must interpret the rest and find out the exact plans for the invasion of Orsha.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012513	Has the curse been lifted?{nl}I suddenly feel a bit lighter now... How did you do that?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012514	What? The bishop... is alive?{nl}Let us not further delay ourselves and save him!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012515	I can barely move in this chilly aura...{nl}You, are you really okay?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012516	You seem to be the only person able to move, so I hope you don't mind me asking a favor.{nl}We'd be in trouble if the demons suddenly attack us, so I want to threaten them a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012517	Gather some red crystals from Blue Dumaro and Wendigo near the Torture Chamber.{nl}It's similar to war trophies so they will be hesitant to attack us if we have a lot of them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012518	You seem to be fine unlike the rest of us...{nl}What did you do?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012519	There was no curse when I came here before on other business.{nl}There were also only petty demons back then.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012520	I'm only sticking around since I've been paid and bound to a contract.{nl}At least I'll be able to scare the few demons trying to get out with this.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012521	I'm having a hard time even talking.{nl}Priest Pranas seems better off, maybe it's the priest powers?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012522	They say that it's an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.{nl}Maybe we can destroy the cursed idols with the evil energy from demons?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012523	Mind if I ask you to gather some Black Wooden Pieces from demons in the Punishment Room?{nl}I know it sounds strange, but it's better than doing nothing.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012524	The petty demons are here just like they were last time.{nl}I would have been leading you if I felt okay but...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012525	What is this? Why did it suddenly turn into a normal piece of wood?{nl}Oh... Could it be the energy from the Goddess Statue?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012526	At least I got to know that I'll be returning to the goddesses {nl}the instant I step away from this Goddess Statue.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012527	Torvana says that the Blue Dumaro and Wendigo are carrying around strange packages.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012528	The reason that they're able to move around in such an environment...{nl}Perhaps they have something in those packages?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012529	If you ever find a reason to go to the prison, why don't you try gathering a few and use them?{nl}Maybe they'll be useful to you as well.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012530	I came because they said they'll pay me ten times the normal rate, and I'm paying dearly for it.{nl}I should stop trusting those priests outside of church.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012531	It's not the effect I was hoping for, but this is quite handy.{nl}I'll have to show it to my colleagues later.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012532	I cannot believe that you are the Revelator who will save this world...{nl}I knew it was strange that you were the only one unaffected by the curse.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012533	Unfortunately I don't have the time to revel in the fact that I'm in the presence of the Revelator.{nl}Like the bishop said: Time is of the utmost importance.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012534	Fortunately, the bishop seems to be safe for now...{nl}We don't know what's happened to the rest of the priests {nl}and we might be caught by Marnox at any moment.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012535	Those Chasers are holding us back.{nl}I can move immediately since I am a priest, but they look like they could use a bit more time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012536	Oh well. I shall go first and see what's going on.{nl}Don't be too far behind!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012537	I'm sorry. I know we don't have time to waste...{nl}I think there's a cursed idol here as well...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012538	Fortunately, Draznie and Auranas seem to be fine.{nl}Let's just hope that the rest of the priests are okay as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012539	This curse... I really can't get used to it at all.{nl}I think we'll need more Orbs of Return.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012540	No matter how powerful the cursed idol is, the idol itself is merely a piece of wood.{nl}We'll have to aim for the instant it is full of evil energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012541	You saw the cursed idol on the way here right?{nl}How about filling it with evil energy by dealing with demons near it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012542	Use the orb when the idol is full to the limit with evil energy.{nl}It will be destroyed as the divine and evil energies collide.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012543	I thought it was all over when I was locked in the Solitary Confinement District.{nl}But seeing you... I feel as if the efforts of the church were not in vain.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012544	The best part is...{nl}According to Auranas it seems that Irma, who was captured by Marnox, is still alive.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012545	I also heard that Irma has a Orb of Return as well.{nl}We should hurry and rescue her before something bad happens to her.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012546	Irma is currently being held in the Solitary Confinement District...{nl}Marnox is sure to be nearby, so make sure you're prepared.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012547	I can't imagine what Irma is going through right now.{nl}I just hope that she'll be okay until you can get to her.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012548	I thought it was all over when I was captured by the Demon Lord...{nl}Thank you so much for rescuing me!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012549	But... I think I heard Marnox call you the Revelator...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012550	Ah... the bishop...{nl}So the bishop is safe as well. {nl}Oh... that's... a relief...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012551	The Orb of Return? Of course I have one.{nl}Here you... Huh?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012552	Oh dear... It seems as if I've used the orb too much.{nl}It seems like it will break at any moment.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012553	I've used it numerous times against that uncouth and arrogant Marnox.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012554	It's too early to give up. There's a way to restore it.{nl}This orb is an instrument that turns powerful evil energy and turns it into divine power...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012555	There's more than enough evil energy around. {nl}The Wendigo Escapees.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012556	You can find the Wendigo Escapees near the Central Passage.{nl}You'll be able to restore the orb by absorbing their life and evil energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012557	Please hurry.{nl}I think Marnox found out where we've hid the Demon Orders.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012558	The seal that protects the orders can't be broken by a demon but...{nl}There is no telling what dirty tricks Marnox may play to break it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012559	I still don't believe I'm alive.{nl}I'm so glad that the bishop and all the other priests are okay too...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012560	You've done well.{nl}Just a little divine power and it will be almost as good as new.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012561	There's a crystal that Draznie prepared for such an occasion.{nl}I think... it should be in the Bird Room and the Supply Room. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012562	The power of light should transfer to the orb from the crystal if you take it there.{nl}Return to me after the orb has absorbed enough of the power.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012563	I don't know how many more cursed idols are in this Underground Prison...{nl}But the only orb we have left is the one I just gave you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012564	I don't know whether to call the bishop meticulous...{nl}Or whether to call him worrisome...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012565	He ordered us priests to prepare things near Orsha.{nl}Of course we never knew why we were preparing things back then.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012566	Then this all happened.{nl}If I could, I want to go back in time and kneel in front of the bishop in gratitude.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012567	During Medzio Diena, it was a nightmare because of the earthquake.{nl}It was still easier to get by back then than it is now...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012568	The fact that there are suddenly so many monsters is a bigger catastrophe.{nl}Of course, it's still better than at the capital. {nl}I've heard that it was completely destroyed during Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012569	I think this will be enough to destroy the idol.{nl}I'm grateful that we could get enough energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012570	It's our only orb and it barely has enough power...{nl}We should try to think of a way to make sure we destroy the idol.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012571	You've succeeded!{nl}The force that was weighing down my body is gone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012572	Now let's go find the orders we've hidden away.{nl}I know the way there, of course. That's why Marnox captured me...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012573	I'll head down to the 3rd floor first.{nl}I think Gelija is there somewhere... I do hope that he is okay.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012574	Priest Gelija is safe!{nl}Now I should focus on finding the Demon Orders.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012575	But...{nl}Oh, I forgot that you probably won't be able to sense it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012576	I think there's a cursed idol here as well.{nl}The problem is that we don't have any Orbs of Return left.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012577	Feeling as if my body is becoming heavier is one thing...{nl}But we cannot open the portal to the Penitence Room {nl}where the Demon Orders is because of the cursed idol.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012578	We've prepared to greet the Revelator on the bishop's orders...{nl}But it looks like we'll be done for if we don't use it now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012579	We've hidden a sack of Pearl Powder in the watchtower.{nl}Do you think you could gather it?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012580	Are you talking about the legends?{nl}Oh, you may not know since you're not from Orsha.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012581	A long time ago...{nl}It is said that a young shepherd boy met a girl that {nl}he had never seen before while tending his sheep.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012582	The girl barely talked, but everything she said happened.{nl}The shepherd boy was fascinated and took the girl to his uncle.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012583	The uncle is said to have shown his respect as soon as he saw the girl.{nl}The girl prophesied of numerous catastrophes to the uncle before disappearing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012584	Medzio Diena and the catastrophe involving Orsha have already occurred...{nl}There is one more prophecy that has only been passed on by the bishops of Orsha.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012585	You can hear the story in more detail from any of the residents of Orsha, {nl}so why don't you ask around?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012586	It's an honor to meet the Revelator that I've only heard of through the legends. {nl}You really do seem to be indifferent to the curse as Priest Pranas said...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012587	The bishop is meticulous... to the point of being overly cautious.{nl}He had prepared to meet the Revelator in a few more places other than here as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012588	Among those numerous places, Ashaq Underground Prison was prepared by myself and Draznie.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012589	I was planning on hiding here for a long time but...{nl}Since you're here, I think using the prepared items is a better idea.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012590	First of all, I've hidden a sack of Pearl Powder in the watchtower.{nl}We can use that against demons to great effect.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012591	I'll explain the details once you get back with the Pearl Powder.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012592	It seems that I still have much to learn...{nl}I can't do anything because of the curse...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012593	Thank the goddesses, Irma is safe!{nl}Now all we have to do is push the demons out of the Ashaq Underground Prison.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012594	Once again, the bishop has impressed me with his wisdom.{nl}If such preparations hadn't been in place, {nl}we wouldn't have been able to deal with the demons at all.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012595	I'd say that my brothers are also in similar hideouts.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012596	I feel so relieved that we've recovered the Demon Orders.{nl}But this is only the beginning. We don't know the contents about it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012597	The pearl powder was scattered all over the floor?{nl}It seems as if the demons had torn into it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012598	Thankfully, this is more than enough to use.{nl}Good job on getting it here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012599	The demons also have a chain of command like we do,{nl}so I think that the other demons will fall if we take out their leaders.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012600	I've crafted an orb from the pearl powder you brought me.{nl}Try using it when you find a demon far away.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012601	I've empowered it with holy power so it will tell you which demons you need to deal with.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012602	You mustn't... think of the demons as monsters.{nl}I've heard that some Demon Lords are as powerful as Goddess Gabija.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012603	Good job.{nl}The demons will be less aggressive for a while since their chain of command is ruined.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012604	I feel awful because of the cursed idols.{nl}I think I need to rest a little at the safer Special Prison District for a while.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012605	We can also react to threats more easily thanks to its height.{nl}The only problem is that the demons are in control of it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012606	I feel guilty for asking for more help...{nl}But could you clear out the Special Prison District for us?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012607	Priest Pranas, Auranas and myself...{nl}We are too weak from the cursed idols to be of any help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012608	I think we need to rest a bit more in the Special Prison District since it's safer than it is here.{nl}It's higher up so that reacting to threats will also be easier.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012609	The problem is that the demons are in control of it.{nl}I know it's a lot to ask, but could you clear it out for us?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012610	Especially Priest Pranas is in a bad state.{nl}Even though he's pretending to be fine just to make us less worried...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012611	I ask of you to hurry since we can't be sure that this place will be safe despite the Goddess Statue.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012612	Thank you.{nl}I'll have to lead the others to the Special Prison District when I see an opportunity.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012613	I thought that I would be able to do anything once I got away from Marnox...{nl}But this curse is preventing me from doing anything.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012614	I can finally be at ease thanks to you.{nl}It seems as if the Revelator sent by the goddesses is different after all...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012615	You are an extraordinarily being to the priests of Orsha.{nl}We've prepared to meet you a long time only relying on legends.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012616	Auranas is in a really bad state.{nl}Pretending to be okay in order so we can worry less isn't doing any good...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012617	Since safety isn't guaranteed here despite the Goddess Statue, I must beg you to hurry.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012618	Oh, thank you for helping out back then.{nl}You saved me from Marnox and even managed to retrieve the Demon Orders...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012619	I feel much better now.{nl}I'm thinking of staying at the Ashaq Underground Prison {nl}for a while and driving the demons out of it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012620	I hope we get a chance to meet again.{nl}May the goddesses bless the path you choose...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012621	Thank you.{nl}I'll have to wait for a chance to take them to the Special Prison District.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012622	I'm so relieved that Irma is safe and sound.{nl}I'm sure she'll dust it off since she's so easygoing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012623	Oh, yes. {nl}We've made a bunch of traps in the Solitary Confinement District{nl}on the orders of the bishop quite some time ago.{nl}I learned this back when I was an apprentice... {nl}It's a trap to lure monsters to a apparition that looks like me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012624	I didn't say anything about them because I feared Irma {nl}might have gotten caught, but I think it's safe now.{nl}If you happen to go there, please be my guest and use the traps.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012625	There are other places where we've prepared hideouts out of the prison as well.{nl}To exaggerate a little, we made so many that we could evacuate the population of Orsha.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012626	Did the demons fall for the traps?{nl}I'd never used them on demons before, so I was a little worried.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012627	I'm so glad that they worked as intended.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012628	Do you... by any chance remember?{nl}I'm sure that the bishop would have mentioned it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012629	If you really are the Revelator, you will be able to stand against Demon Lords with your strength.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012630	The reason we chose this place to hide the Demon Orders is because of the Confession Altar.{nl}It's the altar that the goddess gave her final blessing to the inmates that made their confessions.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012631	It's been a while since the prison was shut down, but the effects from the blessings are still there.{nl}Your powers as Revelator should be enough to liberate that energy.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012632	The cursed idols must be destroyed in order for me to open the portal to the Penitence Room.{nl}I can't do a thing because of this heavy and blasphemous energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012633	There are two Confession Altars...{nl}But let's try the one on the left since it is closer.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012634	The demons seemed to have noticed something is happening.{nl}But the cursed idol still stands...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012635	I am grateful that everything seems to be going well ever since I've met you...{nl}But I am also nervous at the same time. {nl}Especially about the fact that Marnox is so quiet.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012636	I told you there were two altars.{nl}Now all we can do is hope that the one in the oratory will do it's job.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012637	I pray that the goddess look over us and grant us with success...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012638	Please be careful that Marnox doesn't notice you.{nl}That arrogant Demon Lord will not look on as he lost me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012639	You've succeeded!{nl}I feel the curse being lifted.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012640	Now, the cursed idols should be nothing more than mere pieces of wood!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012641	You know what's strange?{nl}Marnox wouldn't leave us to interrupt his plans like this...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012642	I guess it's all for the best.{nl}Maybe he underestimated you and got caught off guard.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012643	Let's not let down the pace and go destroy the cursed idol in the 2nd Watchtower.{nl}I'll get the portal to the Penitence Room ready.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012644	I won't forget the arrogant gestures and expressions Marnox used when he caught me.{nl}He said that he could crush the Revelator or anything else that stands in his way...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012645	I thought it was strange that the demons weren't reacting...{nl}They've been preparing there all along.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012646	But Marnox still didn't come back.{nl}Demons will never be able to open the chest that holds the Demon Orders,{nl}so where else could he be?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012647	I guess he might be planning his next move while he sends his servants.{nl}I'll open the portal since we can't afford to tarry any longer.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012648	Please be right behind me when I open the portal.{nl}Let's head back to the bishop as soon as we have the Demon Orders.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012649	You've defeated Marnox...{nl}Euah...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012650	{nl}I think my wounds are quite deep...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012651	It was an honor that I could see the church achieve its mission.{nl}It's all thanks to you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012652	Don't worry about me, take the Demon Orders to the bishop.{nl}I'm a priest, remember? I'll be fine if I get to rest a little.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012653	Is it true?{nl}You've... defeated Marnox?!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012654	All we could do was run even when all of us attacked him together...{nl}I see that a Revelator has remarkable powers.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012655	To see all the priests alive and well... it's a relief.{nl}I assume that we shall meet in Orsha soon.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012656	I'm really okay. I'll recover my strength if I rest here a while, {nl}so please go and give the Demon Orders to the bishop.{nl}Don't forget to give him my regards.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012657	Now that we've recovered the Demon Orders... Let's head back to Orsha.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012658	The lord tends to attempt to act tough. She is strong, but gentle.{nl}I'm sure she's more worried than anyone else.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012659	I'll head back to Orsha and meet with the lord before continuing {nl}with the interpretation of the Demon Orders.{nl}Why don't you meet with her again?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012660	I shall see you in Orsha then.{nl}I'll make my leave since the interpretation of the Demon Orders is a pressing matter.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012661	I have heard of what you've done from Bishop Urbonas.{nl}All that you've done for us... I don't know how to thank you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012662	I also knew of the legends passed down by the bishops of Orsha.{nl}I never thought that the Revelator of the same legends {nl}would be the one to save Bishop Urbonas...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012663	The person that will save not only Orsha, but also the goddesses and the world...{nl}It is an honor to meet that Revelator.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012664	It seems as if the goddesses have not forsaken Orsha even if they have all disappeared.{nl}I wish I could let everyone know of your deeds but...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012665	I am sorry. I cannot announce that demons have come this close to the city.{nl}I hope that you will understand the fact that I {nl}cannot spread confusion and fear among my people.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012666	I thank you once more as the lord of Orsha for what you have done.{nl}Bishop Urbonas will be waiting for you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012667	Greetings. Impeccable timing! {nl}I've just finished the final interpretation of the Demon Orders.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012668	There may be a few parts where its inaccurate but...{nl}Allow me to explain with a bit of a liberal translation.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012669	"You may leave the human lord alone since we have obtained the holy power we were after.{nl}Miss Giltine wants more tangible results."{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012670	"Deploy the Kruvina in the predetermined reservoir and execute the spore plan.{nl}Death will engulf this world."{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012671	"P.S. Miss Giltine has ordered the annihilation of the Revelator.{nl}You must get rid of the Revelator before they meet the girl."{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012672	This is all of it.{nl}Its contents are so intimidating that I wonder if I actually translated it properly...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012673	I will pass this information to the lord...{nl}It is frustrating since we can barely protect Orsha much less send out investigation parties.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012674	What could this 'Kruvina' possibly be...{nl}I couldn't find anything mentioned in any of the old texts either.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012675	Now, Revelator... What is your next plan?{nl}It may be simply the worries of an old man, {nl}but the spore plan mentioned in the Demon Orders...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012676	Spores are merely the seeds of mushrooms or ferns and such.{nl}I can't help but wonder if the plan has anything to do with the Koru Jungle famed for its ferns...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012677	The choice is yours, of course.{nl}Although our meeting may have been a coincidence, you did save me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012678	I am sure that the goddess has arranged it so that all of your travels lead to the salvation of all...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012679	I bid thee well.{nl}I shall pray for the deliverance and blessings of the goddesses {nl}to lead and protect you on your journey.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012680	I hope that you will keep a place in your heart for Orsha.{nl}The people of Orsha will always welcome you here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012681	Until now, we thought of the demons below Demon Lords...{nl}Little more than larger and more vicious monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012682	We never thought that they would have such a detailed{nl}command structure and threaten us like this.{nl}We will have to research their command structure in more detail {nl}to respond to them more effectively.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012683	If you ever have the chance to face the demons at Felon Prison...{nl}Could you possibly collect Marnox's Insignias for me?{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012684	The entire church was swayed by a single Demon Lord...{nl}How powerful do you think a Demon King or Demon Goddess might be?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012685	Thank you! {nl}I'll go straight to Orsha to research this subject as soon as things are settled here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012686	Ah... It is a pleasure to meet you.{nl}I've heard from Irja... that you're 'that Revelator'.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012687	But we didn't know that they'd threaten us with such an organized structure.{nl}We'll need to confirm their command structure once things are settled here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012688	Could you gather Marnox's Insignias when you deal with the demons in the Felon Prison?{nl}I think we'll be able to research the demon's command structure with those.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012689	It's a relief seeing Irma safe after being captured by Marnox.{nl}Now all we have to do is retrieve the Demon Orders.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012690	I'm nervous. Especially about the fact that Marnox is so quiet...{nl}I'm sure that he's planning something behind the scenes.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012691	I'm wounded myself...{nl}But I'm more worried about the condition the other priests are in.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012692	I brought some potions and bandages in case something like this happened...{nl}But I had to leave them behind since we were chased by the demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012693	I know it's a lot to ask, but you're the only one that can help.{nl}Could you find my medicine bags so I can cure the other priests?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012694	The wounds of the other priests are severe, including Priest Irma.{nl}I brought potions and bandages just in case, but since we were chased by demons...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012695	I am reluctant to ask the Revelator who has done so much but...{nl}Could you find my medicine bags so I can cure the other priests?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012696	I know it is blasphemous, but I had always had my doubts about the Revelator.{nl}But you've defeated Marnox, who all of the priests together couldn't handle.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012697	Now I know.{nl}Only you, who has been sent by the goddesses can really save the world...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012698	Thank you so much for saving my colleagues.{nl}You ran in even though you knew that there were demons...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012699	Hmm... Rose is really late.{nl}Should we wait a little bit more?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012700	Not all priests can heal by miraculous powers.{nl}We have to put a stick next to the broken part and get medicine for the injury.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012701	I do feel uncomfortable for the words I have used.{nl}Rose is still out and I am a bit worried.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012702	What happened to the people of the Croa Village?{nl}And why are there demons here?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012703	The last time I have visited here, there was no sight of a demon.. {nl}I am worried something awful has happened.{nl}Have you heard anything about this situation?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012704	Thank you for getting me my missing bag.{nl}Right after I heal myself I have to go to the other priests.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012705	Rose is late... far too late.{nl}They say no news is good news, but this is not the time.{nl}What should we do?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012706	Has Tess been chased by the demons just like other people?{nl}I have no idea what happened here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012707	All the idols that can be destroyed have been destroyed but it was a rushed job...{nl}I am still hung up about the fragments left behind.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012708	The fragments could come back to bite us in the back, if not its energy remains.{nl}I am terribly sorry about this but could you take care of the remaining pieces?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012709	I am grateful for your kindness.{nl}Wait for a second for I will give you a piece of cloth soaked with Holy Water.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012710	Cover the Idol Fragments with this Holy Water Cloth and it will be purified.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012711	One less thing to worry about.{nl}Restoring this place will not be an easy task.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012712	Along with the bishop, we destroyed all the idols we could get our hands on {nl}while on the run from Marnox's chase.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012713	If you don't deal with the fragments, its malicious energy will come back to haunt us again.{nl}I'm sure you must be tired and weary on this journey, {nl}but could we ask for an undeserved request?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012714	First, show me what you got.{nl}I guess, defeating Red Kepas and Woodins, 10 each at the Paupys Crossing would suffice.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012715	It's heart-wrenching to see those who have fled their home to here.{nl}If only they learnt the ways of the Highlander's sword.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012716	I, as the Highlander Submaster, am helping the immigrants the best I can...{nl}I am worried if the migration orders aren't a big burden to the lord.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012717	Are you the one willing to walk the path of a Highlander?{nl}A test awaits you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012718	Those without the necessary talents should waste no breath.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012719	The main weapon of a Highlander is a two-handed sword.{nl}It's a powerful weapon but it does require great strength to wield one.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012720	Now try to attack the sword pell nearby.{nl}I will see how strong you are.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012721	Now try to attack the sword pell nearby.{nl}And I will make the call.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012722	Hmm... You're a bit lacking.{nl}A further test is in order.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012723	But your strength itself is quite impressive, to be honest.{nl}But mere brute force is not enough. The finesse is the key to handle it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012724	Defeating Woodins each at the Paupys Crossing, for you, would not be too much to ask, would it?{nl}Defeat them and I will let you in.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012725	It's not that difficult as a test.{nl}If you can handle your own strength, that is.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012726	You look like someone who will not tarnish the name of Highlander.{nl}My father, also a Highlander, before me will say the same.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012727	I, on behalf of my master, will teach you the path of the Highlander.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012728	Do you desire to become a Peltasta?{nl}You made a wise choice.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012729	We, Peltastas, have to know the way to utilize our shields properly to fend off enemies.{nl}Therefore, the basic understanding of a shield is a prerequisite. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012730	I want you to get me some materials to make a shield.{nl}If you can do this, I will consider worthy enough to be a Peltasta.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012731	Defeat Pokuborns in the Woods of the Linked Bridges and retrieve Pokuborn Tusks.{nl}Oh, and one more thing...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012732	Get me some dry wood from the abandoned workshop at the Paupys Crossing.{nl}It belonged to our trading partner but it went out of business. {nl}The owner did say we can take as much as we please.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012733	Learn the structure of a shield to utilize it efficiently.{nl}I'll wait for your return.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012734	Ah, those who aim to become a Peltasta never disappoint me.{nl}You're done, congratulations on becoming one of us.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012735	We always welcome a new brethren.{nl}Could we ask you to help the people here?

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012737	The masters in Klaipeda insisted that I should not leave Orsha.{nl}So, if you want to prove your worth, this is your chance.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012738	Don't think of it only as a mission...{nl}But think of it as punishment on those monsters terrorising the people.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012739	The road to giving yourself up to the goddess is a noble one. {nl}I commend you for choosing this path.{nl}However, a test to see if you can become a Krivis.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012740	Good. This test is quite simple.{nl}But first, take this Torch Gem.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012741	This gem will absorb the life force of a monster and store it as its energy.{nl}Fill this gem with the vitality of the monsters and come back to me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012742	Once the gem is filled with energy. Use it on the flameholder besides me.{nl}What I am looking for is how well can you handle the energy of Torch's power.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012743	Let's recap. Defeat the monster and fill the gem up.{nl}Use the energy to light the flameholder beside me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012744	Your determined eyes do tell me that you are seeking the way of Priesthood.{nl}I can clearly see not only the will but the talent.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012745	However... A bit of preparation is needed.{nl}To prepare for the journey to completely give yourself up to the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012746	Take this Holy Water.{nl}Ask the other Cleric Masters for their blessings.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012751	But does your pounding heart command you still?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012752	Very well. I take that as yes.{nl}Sweep the Gosarus in the Dadan Jungle.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012753	Ten-odd Gosarus won't cut it.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012755	I want to see how much you have trained yourself as a Highlander.{nl}The Gosarus in the Dadan Jungle would serve quite nicely.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012760	Now, let me give you this counter. Use it while defeating monsters.{nl}As you defeat them, the number will go up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012761	Oh, it won't count if you do it without equipping a shield.{nl}I'll count it as double if you defeat a demon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012762	Just remember... You'll have to start from the beginning if you become incapacitated.{nl}I will not accept any results that come from working with colleagues.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012763	Do you understand?{nl}Well then, good luck.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012764	It'll be worth testing only if you use a shield, don't you think?{nl}Don't forget that dealing with demons is more efficient.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012765	I think that you've proven that you are worthy of saying that you are a Peltasta.{nl}As promised, I'll teach you more advanced skills.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012812	My chisel is all worn out.{nl}I think I'll have to make a request to Illanai, the blacksmith in Orsha.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012813	Illanai will give you a new chisel if you say that it's a request from me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012814	I'm sorry. Could you make the trip to Orsha for me?{nl}I have something left to do here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012815	How can I help you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012816	Ah, I know Zenoa very well myself. {nl}You're talking about that cute Divdirbys right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012817	I'm sorry, but...{nl}I don't have any chisels prepared, and I'm fresh out of materials to make new ones.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012818	I'm sorry, is it very urgent?{nl}Hmm.. I think I might be able to help out if you bring me the ingredients.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012819	You can obtain high quality metals from the Grummers at Dadan Jungle.{nl}I'll do it before anything else if you can get me some of those metals.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012820	I don't know what the Grummers eat but... {nl}High quality metals form like pearls inside them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012821	Well, it's all good for me I suppose.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012822	You've already brought it back?{nl}I've got the preparations ready, so it'll be done soon enough.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012823	This time it will remain sharp for a long time since I've made it as strong as possible.{nl}Here, take this to Zenoa please.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012824	Tell Zenoa to come by Orsha some day.{nl}That I really miss the company.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012825	Oh dear... {nl}I thought it was taking longer than expected.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012826	I thank you all the same.{nl}Come back any time and I'll be glad to teach you!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012827	You've really become much better in a short period of time!{nl}I would be proud to show your skills to anybody else.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012828	I just think that it may be a bit short to meet the standards of my father in Klaipeda.{nl}I'll help you get to a higher stage in achievements.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012829	Good. Shall we check what you've learned so far?{nl}Defeat a monster with Highlander skills. It doesn't matter what monster you choose.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012830	Defeating them yourself is extremely important.{nl}Without the aid of any Highlander colleagues.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012831	Defeat monsters using Highlander skills. {nl}I think it's an easy task considering that it's the last test.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012832	It seems as if you'll be able to learn more difficult skills with ease.{nl}I'd feel confident when telling anyone that I was the one that taught you those moves.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012833	You'll be able to deal with most demons with your skills.{nl}But you must become a bit stronger to defeat truly powerful demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012834	I shall open the road to becoming a true Peltasta.{nl}I'm sure that you'll have no trouble.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012835	They say that a Chaparition is threatening people at Karolis Springs.{nl}I think that it will be fitting for a test of your strength.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012836	The Chaparition should be an easy opponent considering the courage you've shown so far.{nl}Don't be too worried.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012837	Excellent.{nl}With skills like that, I'd trust you with my back any day.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012838	I'll report it to the master soon.{nl}I'll first teach you of the true powers of the Peltasta on my initiative.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012839	Your growth is simply astonishing.{nl}I feel something different from the other Hoplites.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012840	But are you satisfied with that?{nl}I think you can go for the next step.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012841	There's a monster that I've previously faced.{nl}Sparnasman, I thought that I had him... But I lost him at the last moment.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012842	I've heard rumors that the Sparnasman has returned.{nl}I'm sure that you'll be able to finish him in my place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012843	Oh, and bring the tip of my spear as evidence that you've defeated him.{nl}It should still be stuck in him.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012844	Please defeat the Sparnasman at Novaha Annes and bring the tip of my spear back to me.{nl}{nl}It was a long time ago, but the fight... was extremely fierce.{nl}I was tired and he also had steam rising from him.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012845	I adjusted my grip on my spear thinking that it would be the killing blow.{nl}He finally came at me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012846	I thought I'd properly stabbed him... But he suddenly passed me and flew away. {nl}With my spear still in him.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012847	I've let him go.{nl}Currently, I'd be able to deal with it in a single strike but...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012848	That is most certainly the tip of the spear I drove into it.{nl}I'll be able to brag that one of our capable Hoplites has defeated that nightmare.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012849	Come back at any time since you've passed the test.{nl}I am also ready to teach you more.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012850	Hmm... You seem as if you've grown stronger.{nl}You may be worthy to learn more of the way of the sword since you've trained so much.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012851	Of course I can't simply let you know. {nl}Prove your strength first!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012852	Dealing with monsters at Feretory Hills is your test.{nl}But it must be done without enhancements. What use would the test be it them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012853	Of course the help of colleagues is excluded as well.{nl}Do you get it? Prove your worth with the might of your sword alone.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012854	Without colleagues. Without enhancements.{nl}It is a very easy and simple test.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012855	You. You're more useful than you look.{nl}The Master will be pleased that such talent has chosen to become a Barbarian.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012856	We Rodelero attack enemies by blocking their view with shields and going for their blind spots.{nl}I'd say that such strategies will work the better your shield is.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012857	Since it is still the introductory stage, let's start with bringing a shield that has been enhanced 4 times.{nl}I think that's cutting you enough slack, what do you think?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012858	You have to equip a shield that has been enhanced 4 times at the very least.{nl}How did you even think of becoming a Rodelero without that.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012859	Good. That is enough.{nl}I now welcome you as a fellow Rodelero.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012860	Cataphract... Not a bad choice.{nl}We bombard the enemies with attacks riding atop our companions while we charge through enemy lines.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012861	But simply looking nice and what acutally happens is never the same.{nl}It shall be a completely different route from what you've done. Do you think you're up for it?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012862	Then how about we test your resolve?{nl}I shall acknowledge you if you have enough determination to deal with the demons at Feretory Hills.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012863	It is disconcerting to give you a truly difficult task if you keep requesting it after I threatened you.{nl}I think that Feretory Hills should be a suitable test for you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012864	Impressive. {nl}I apologize for treating you lightly on first impression.{nl}My lessons are not to be taken lightly. I hope you are determined.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012865	The time has finally come.{nl}The Master at Klaipeda said that faithfulness is the strength of a Krivis.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012866	The master would have asked you to prove yourself through sparring... {nl}But I wish to test your skills through servitude.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012867	Please be cautious as this is the last test.{nl}Tell me when you are prepared.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012868	They say that the monsters are swelling in numbers at Feretory Hills and are now threatening the people.{nl}Please purify the monsters with this jemstone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012869	It is not easy to purify by normal means.{nl}You'll have to tire the monsters a bit for it to have an effect.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012870	Please bring the purified ashes to me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012871	I am thinking of it as a service to everyone.{nl}That seems to be fitting of a Krivis.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012872	I ponder if such servitude is the mercy of the goddesses.{nl}Well done. Such posture shall lead you to greater stages.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012873	You wish to continue to follow the path of the goddesses burdened as a priest.{nl}If so, you may rise to a greater stage by defeating evils in this world.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012874	It is said that monsters at Feretory Hills are full of evil energy.{nl}Deal with them in the name of the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012875	You've now become a respectable Bokor.{nl}I wish to forsee your future as a colleague, not as a beginner.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012876	Please bring me the card of a powerful monster.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012877	The master said that the cards that people choose are pre-determined...{nl}But it is beyond my ability to see what card you shall bring.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012878	Eternal flames, a women with wounds on her back, an upturned jewel...{nl}These are about all the words that I can make out.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012879	Its interpretation is up to you.{nl}But it seems to me as if you have a greater mission, at variance from the common person.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012880	I shall pray for you to be able to finish your mission.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012881	Grandfather Tesla had always emphasized the importance of materials.{nl}Not simply rare and expensive materials, but materials that you will be able to put your heart into.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012882	I've recently had a chance to get such materials...{nl}But I simply could not get the chance to get them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012883	I'll teach you how to craft new statues if you bring them to me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012884	Look for Sparnasman in Novaha Annex.{nl}Its horns are the materials that I've been looking for so be careful please.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012885	Grandfather Tesla said that he found them at the Crystal Mine.{nl}Those blue crystals were wonderful... but I wish to find some that suit me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012886	These are indeed the materials that I requested.{nl}Someday, you shall find materials that are to your liking as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012887	Now, as promised, I shall teach you to craft new statues.{nl}Come back to me at any time.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012888	The path of the Sadhu...{nl}So you seek to go down a difficult path.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012889	Very well. Though it is hard for me to properly test you as I am currently out of body.{nl}I shall do so in my own way.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012890	I shall give you a materialized crystal of my energy.{nl}My task is for you to deal with monsters after injecting them with my energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012891	I shall purify the monster's souls that you bring me with pure energy.{nl}But, the monsters must be dealt by yourself without the help of others.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012892	My body? It is at Akmens Ridge.{nl}You shall be able to send your spirit as far as I can once you've trained as much as I have.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012893	But it is a stage that must be achieved... {nl}Slowly step by step through intense training.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012894	You've done admirably even if it was a simple test.{nl}I shall look forward to your growth.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012895	The strength to fight against the evil demons comes from one's devout faith in the goddesses.{nl}If you wish to become one of us, you must prove your strength to back up your faith.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012896	Good. Now shall we put you to the test?{nl}Report back after you've dealt with all of the monsters at Feretory Hills.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012897	We Paladins are always on front lines of the fight with demons.{nl}You won't be able to stay alive for long if you are not skilled even if you do have a rightous heart.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012898	You've done better than any of my expectations.{nl}Now vow to fight for the goddesses as a paladin for your faith and justice.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012899	Are you planning on passing the Delmore Castle?{nl}If you do, I suggest turning around immediately.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012900	This is a place that has become a den of demons because of the lord of the castle.{nl}We have gathered here... because he is once more attempting to do the same horrible deeds.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012901	Never... Never again shall we allow the same thing to happen.{nl}I am ashamed of myself... but if this can be any form of retribution...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012902	This is a place that has become a den of demons because of the lord of the castle.{nl}We should have discovered the true identity of the Kruvina earlier...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012903	Maybe if you were a Revelator...{nl}Anyway, I've warned you enough so you should return to where it's safe.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012904	You're a Revelator as well?{nl}Hmm... If that's true...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012905	We've gathered here to stop Delmore Rephaim, the lord of the Delmore Castle.{nl}All because he's trying to create another Kruvina.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012906	Oh, do you know about the Kruvina?{nl}The demon's plan to use the spores of death to invade Orsha...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012907	The Kruvina crafted by Delmore Rephaim is the center piece of that plan...{nl}Which can also exhibit tremendous strength depending on how it is used.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012908	Delmore Rephaim was once a revered lord and established alchemist...{nl}But he touched upon forbidden alchemy by conspiring with the demons. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012909	That's how the pinnacle of demon magic and human technology was created.{nl}That creation is known as the Kruvina.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012910	I was once a mage under Delmore Rephaim as well.{nl}But I ran after seeing him create the Kruvina, which simply made me feel sick.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012911	I should have stopped its creation... But I was a coward back then.{nl}Delmore Rephaim is trying to build that Kruvina once more.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012912	Such terrible events... must not be allowed to happen again.{nl}That's why we've gathered the Revelators from Klaipeda and brought them here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012913	I'd say the more the merrier.{nl}How about lending a hand in stopping him since you're a Revelator as well?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012914	It's a relief to have your cooperation.{nl}Oh, we were just about to destroy the Magic Power Supply Devices {nl}supplying the Kruvina Devices with power.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012915	The device is protected by a powerful protection spell...{nl}They've cast it on ordinary items to obscure the spell.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012916	I'll mark the places where I predict they may be, so take this compass with you.{nl}It's a compass that reacts to magic, so I'm sure it'll react to the spells.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012917	Delmore Rephaim had great ambitions.{nl}It would have been much better if that was merely a lust for power...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012918	Above Amjene Sanctum and... Hmm. I see. Good job. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012919	To sustain such an enormous magic circle, Delmore Rephaim...{nl}He placed numerous Magic Power Supply Devices {nl}around the castle as well as at the Kruvina Device.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012920	Creating a large magic circle by oneself is simply impossible, no matter how talented you are.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012921	Oh, I see some introductions are in order. {nl}The person next to me is Revelator Mihail.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012922	I'm a Revelator just like you.{nl}How about talking to Mihail while I interpret the protection spells?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012923	Impressive.{nl}I've searched for protection spell as well, but I wasn't that fast.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012924	I couldn't believe what Melchioras was saying at first.{nl}But just look at the castle. I realized the severity of the situation soon enough.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012925	I don't know too much about magic, but this is still the largest magic circle I've seen.{nl}You don't know what I'm talking about do you? I mean that the entire castle is a magic circle.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012926	Greetings. Have you come from Orsha?{nl}I thought there weren't any Revelators there... We've all come from Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012927	I've seen many places destroyed by the roots on Medzio Diena...{nl}But the scene here is a bit different.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012928	It seems as if they've all been ripped off the face of the world at the same time.{nl}Not just the residents, but even all the soldiers and vassals...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012929	Mage Melchioras seems to be taking a while to disarm the protective spell.{nl}How about we get prepared for the next move while he's at it?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012930	It seems that we get along well.{nl}We've destroyed all the other Magic Power Supply Devices... {nl}The only one left is the one that Mage Melchioras is working on.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012931	We have to destroy it with magic orbs when Mage Melchioras disarms the protection spell...{nl}But we don't have many left.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012932	I'll get the detonator ready, so why don't you fill the empty orbs with magic?{nl}The orb will gather magic every time you attack Pags.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012933	When I first arrived at Klaipeda... {nl}There were an incredible amount of Revelators gathered there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012934	Those people, what do you think they're doing now?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012935	It's taking a while to interpret the protection spell cast on the Magic Power Supply Devices.{nl}Could you wait a little more until I've finished?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012936	That was quick.{nl}It seems as if Melchioras has finished his preparations as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012937	Why don't you go to Mage Melchioras?{nl}I know what's going on, but you might want some explanation seeing as you've just arrived here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012938	One day, the goddess appeared in my dreams telling me that I am a Revelator and that I must go to Klaipeda.{nl}Saying that only Revelators can save the world...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012939	At first, I was at a loss of what to do, and I was here before I knew it.{nl} Then, it came to me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012940	The fact that... Everything I did was linked to saving the goddesses and the world.{nl}Perhaps the goddesses sent so many Revelators for that same reason?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012941	I've finished interpretating the protection spell cast on the Magic Power Supply Devices.{nl}We'll need your help in order to get the job done in a hurry.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012942	I'll give you this amulet.{nl}The protection spell will be disarmed when you put it on the enchanted object.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012943	You take care of the protection spell above Amjene Sanctum.{nl}Mihail and I will take care of the rest.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012944	We won't have to come back here if we destroy the last Magic Power Supply Device.{nl}It won't take too long to stop the entire Kruvina Device either.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012945	There were many mages under the command of Delmore Rephaim just like me.{nl}We were all in charge of separate specializations so interpretating this will take a while.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012946	I was in charge of the core of the Kruvina device.{nl} I thought that there was something wrong...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012947	I was in charge of the core of the Kruvina device.{nl}I thought that there was something wrong...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012948	You've done well. {nl}All we have to do is destroy the Magic Power Supply Device since the protective spells are gone.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012949	The rest of the protective spells have been taken care of.{nl}Now it's my turn.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012950	I'm sure you've heard of the orbs from Mihail.{nl}Please set them around the Magic Power Supply Device at Ishinti Crossroads.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012951	Please go to Mihail as soon as the orbs are in place.{nl}He'll detonate the orbs.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012952	It's strange how well everything seems to be going.{nl}I'm sure that Delmore Rephaim is creating the Kruvina somewhere...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012953	I've tuned it so that the device will be destroyed with the smallest explosion possible...{nl}But run away from the orbs just in case you don't get caught in the explosion.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012954	Demolitions are my speciality.{nl}Destroying a device like that is nothing as long as I get to plant the explosives right.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012955	Please let Mihail know that the orbs are ready.{nl}I hope everything goes as planned...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012956	It's a success!{nl}Both you and Mihail did a great job.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012957	The Kruvina device will soon stop since all of the {nl}Magic Power Supply Devices have been destroyed.{nl}The protective shield will disappear as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012958	We cannot simply relax because the device has stopped.{nl}We must destroy it so that they can never think of creating the Kruvina ever again.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012959	Come to Delmore Manor where the device is.{nl}I'll be waiting there.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012961	I hoped it would be migration suggestions... But somehow I don't think it is.{nl}Where are all the soldiers and vassals, not to mention the residents?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012962	We're helping the Revelators from behind the scenes.{nl}But we never knew there would be so many demons...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012963	This place... is terrible.{nl}I've seen many ruins but, this place seems to be on a league of its own.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012964	Ah, I may not be a Revelator... But I volunteered to help.{nl}I'm trying to collect information on demons, but it seems as if I took it too lightly.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012965	Oh, would you be okay in doing so?{nl}If so, I won't say no.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012966	I've collected all the other information... but I need some about the Pag Ampler.{nl}Just tell me how you've dealt with them after defeating them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012967	You could tell us now if you already know enough.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012968	We're trying to lessen the burden when the Revelators are dealing with demons.{nl}Please do your best to collect information even if it is a bit tiresome.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012969	You've been a big help.{nl}I'm going to have to tell the other Revelators about your deeds when I'm explaining to the others.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012970	Before I came here, I was asked a favor from a person {nl}who said that they had relatives in the Delmore Castle.{nl}They asked me to give their regards since they'd lost contact for a while.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012971	But... As you can see...{nl}Who knew this would have happened...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012972	I was trying to give him the remaining pages of the diary...{nl}But I wasn't able to manage to make the time because things kept coming up.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012973	Thank you so much.{nl}He says his name is Ardel and he lived at the Old Bazaar Site.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012974	I've heard snippets of information on the Delmore Castle.{nl}But I don't know how it became like this. Melchioras keeps saving his breath...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012975	I don't know how to thank you.{nl}I'll remember to hand this back to you if we manage to get back.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012976	Follower Nuodas
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012977	What do you have to do to make that many people disappear?{nl}It is creepy how all the household belongings and other things are left as they are.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012978	I've heard many stories of losing hometowns because of monsters or demons after Medzio Diena.{nl}But this is different. It seems as if something was ripped out of the castle whole...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012979	This was the next most thriving castle after Orsha.{nl}But the fact that such a place could become like this in an instant...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012980	It's unfortunate what happened to the missing people, but there is nothing we can do.{nl}All we can do is to keep getting rid of those accursed demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012981	How about helping out?{nl}I think that's one way of comforting the people that used to live here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012982	Thank you.{nl}Could you deal with the demons nearby please?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012983	I feel terrible.{nl}Only a year ago, it was still pretty intact despite Medzio Diena.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012984	But now...{nl}Maybe where we live isn't safe anymore either.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012985	I hope that this will comfort them a little.{nl}There are still many demons, but we will be able to defeat all of them one day.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012986	I felt as if the Revelator and the followers pulled their weight.{nl}Their archery skill was quite impressive.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012987	But as a fletcher, I think that they waste too many arrows...{nl}They don't think of aiming for the weak spots and just pour arrows into a single demon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012988	There are more than a few Charcoal Walkers wondering about with usable arrows.{nl}Could you gather those arrows after dealing with those demons?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012989	The more the world is in chaos, the more thrifty you should be.{nl}Please, I ask of you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012990	There are many followers besides me that are helping you.{nl}Please help them if you see them and don't just pass by.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012991	There is now way I am wrong. I've designed it after all...{nl}If there is even a faint chance of that, I can only imagine that there is a new magic circle.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012992	Making a Magic Power Supply Device Kruvina is impossible.{nl}I am sure that there is another Supply Device hidden somewhere forming another magic circle.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012993	Oh... Did you see it all?{nl}It's all my fault.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012994	Delmore Rephaim is not a shabby person...{nl}Even Revelator Mihail received the same treatment because of me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012995	We can't just give up like this.{nl}Somehow we have to find a way to neutralize the Magic Power Supply Device!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012996	It's true that Melchioras made a mistake, but Yane was too rash this time.{nl}It would be fine if Yane has a good solution... but this doesn't feel good.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012997	There are always followers of Yane gathering near her.{nl}Yane is determined and reliable... But is also hasty.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012998	Thinking that it would be the same situation as when I ran was a mistake.{nl}I'm sure that there's a hidden Magic Power Supply Device somewhere.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_012999	You... There is something else I wish to ask of you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013000	If my calculations are correct, it should be somewhere in the Rampart Reconstruction District...{nl}Head over there with this crystal.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013001	You'll be able to find the Magic Power Supply Device when you put this crystal on the floor.{nl}I'll be notified when one is discovered and send Revelator Mihail to take care of it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013002	There will be no second mistake.{nl}I'm positive that my calculations are correct.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013003	There is a need to divide tasks in order to get things done in a hurry.{nl}I'll take care of the Magic Power Supply Device when you find them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013004	Revelator Mihail has gone to take care of the Magic Power Supply Device.{nl}But... There seems to be a few new Supply Devices...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013005	Evil energy is continuing to flow in... near the Buried Central Plaza.{nl}I didn't sense it a while ago, but why...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013006	Take theses jewels please.{nl}I am a bit suspicious but there is just no other way.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013007	I know it may sound like an excuse... But it's just too strange.{nl}There's no way I am wrong...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013008	I think things are going in a bad direction.{nl}I... I'm sorry. I'll keep concentrating.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013009	So there was no Magic Power Supply Device, only a horde of monsters?{nl}That's odd... I'm sorry.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013010	I must have been a little confused earlier.{nl}Next time I'll try to pay more attention so I don't give you any wrong information.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013011	This time I'm sure.{nl}Please... Will you go to the Handicraft Workshop once again?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013012	What?{nl}You say Yane found a new way to do it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013013	How does that even...{nl}Can you share any more details?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013014	She found it in Delmore Rephaim's document...?{nl}What kind of person writes down the way to destroy their own device?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013015	This has to be a trap.{nl}We need to stop Yane before it's too late!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013016	So everyone gathers around the device and attacks at the same time?{nl}Are you sure...? I really don't think that's the way to destroy it!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013017	Now I know. I realize what went wrong...{nl}Delmore Rephaim was watching us all the entire time!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013018	Whatever we do we can't gather by the device!{nl}We need to stop Yane, quick!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013019	This Kruvina... it's made using human lives!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013020	Melchioras, did you say... human lives?{nl}Oh no, we need to do something!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013021	I'll go first and try to talk to her.{nl}You and Melchioras, come with me!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013022	If the device is activated, the Revelators will all turn into Kruvina!{nl}We need to go to Palma Central Plaza right now and stop Yane!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013023	You're... the one who helped Melchioras.{nl}I really don't know what to say to him...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013024	I should have believed him right away...{nl}But I guess I was too greedy...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013025	I don't know if he'll ever accept my apologies...{nl}But rescuing him is the least I can do to try and redeem myself.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013026	I also thought at first that Melchioras was leading us to a trap...{nl}I really don't know how I'll ever be able to face him now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013027	We should set up a base camp to help Melchioras heal.{nl}That way he'll be safe when he comes back... Let's hope he does...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013028	Everything else is fine, but the barricade is going to be a problem.{nl}There aren't enough materials around to build one, {nl}and we can't tear down another barricade to make our own...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013029	And after the Kruvina device, my condition isn't the best either...{nl}If that's okay with you, will you help us set up the barricade?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013030	I think I saw some crates on the way to the Handicraft Workshop and on the Kalbos Vacant Lot.{nl}Try and find some wood boards there.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013031	It's hard to believe, honestly.{nl}We barely managed to destroy the Magic Power Supply Device, but if that was all in vain...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013032	But the fact is, this was our fault.{nl}How are we ever going to face Melchioras again...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013033	Wow, that's... Thank you so much.{nl}I should go and pray to the goddesses for Melchioras to come back safe and sound.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013034	Thanks to Melchioras I'm alive...{nl}I feel so sorry to him, but all I can do now is prepare for{nl}his return so we can nurse him back to health in safety...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013035	This is way too many demons!{nl}And my condition isn't really... Will you please help me?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013036	If I knew what kind of place this was I would've thought twice about coming.{nl}But Melchioras... he came back here knowing what this was.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013037	Everyone feels so sorry for Melchioras.{nl}I don't even know how to apologize to him...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013038	You're... close to Melchioras, right?{nl}It would be great if you could let him know we're sorry...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013039	Follower Wedge
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013040	When the magic circle was activated it felt as if a hand was pulling on my spirit.{nl}Not an experience I'd like to repeat.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013041	I knew this would happen.{nl}If Melchioras was really trying to trick us he would've taken us to the device right away.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013042	I'm going to make some medicine for when Melchioras returns...{nl}Would you please give me a hand?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013043	There's a type of mushroom called Thorn Mushroom.{nl}It helps people with serious injuries regain their health.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013044	They're the only type of mushroom that grows on the Kalbos Vacant Lot {nl}and the Buried Central Plaza...{nl}I'm sure they'll be easy to find.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013045	If Melchioras doesn't make it...{nl}I can hardly imagine how guilty we'll feel, not just Yane but all of us.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013046	Everyone was really unfair to Melchioras.{nl}I have no excuse either. I should have listened to him...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013047	Anyway, thanks for the mushrooms.{nl}I hope I get to give this medicine to Melchioras.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013048	Melchioras is truly an honorable man.{nl}He did after all sacrifice himself for the people who villified him.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013049	We have many injured, and there's monsters and demons everywhere.{nl}If we can't wipe them all out, our best bet is to chase away the monsters as much as we can.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013050	I'm sorry, but could you collect some Charog sap?{nl}I want to make a monster repellant.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013051	The people who lived here... they must have all been turned into Kruvina.{nl}I wish Melchioras had told us everything from the beginning...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013052	It's time to roll up our sleeves now.{nl}There is something we used to do in my hometown, {nl}except we had demons there, not monsters...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013053	I think Delmore Rephaim is planning to use Melchioras as a shield.{nl}We should hurry.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013054	I'm mostly worried about Melchioras.{nl}Delmore Rephaim... if we leave him be he's just going to try and make another Kruvina.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013055	Revelator Connor
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013056	Delmore Rephaim...{nl}Seeing how he made the Kruvina, he's not someone we should underestimate.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013057	Everyone is... in their worst condition...{nl}But we're willing to do anything to rescue Melchioras and stop Delmore Rephaim.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013058	The crossroads start here. I think it's best if we split into groups and surround him.{nl}He'll be more intimidated once he realizes he has nowhere to escape.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013059	Connor and I will head to Tagika Crossroads.{nl}You and Mihail take the Outskirts Central Plaza.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013060	He may be on the run, but don't forget Delmore Rephaim is a talented alchemist.{nl}Not to mention he can be very persuasive.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013061	We don't know what kind of trap he has prepared, so be very careful.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013062	We're getting closer to him on both sides of the crossroads.{nl}He'll be more intimidated once he realizes he has nowhere to escape.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013063	Mihail is waiting.{nl}Are you ready yet?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013064	I pray for the chance to redeem myself...{nl}May the goddesses protect Melchioras...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013065	You take the bottom area.{nl}If one side fails, the other needs to step up and support right away.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013066	That was a really tough enchantment.{nl}I wonder how Yane did in Tagika Crossroads...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013067	I... I feel completely sick to my stomach.{nl}My whole body feels terrible after being around that Kruvina device.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013068	And Yane... She's too proud to admit she was affected...{nl}But she was close to the device, she probably has it way worse than me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013069	I'm worried she may have already got to Delmore Rephaim.{nl}Let's go down and find her.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013070	Thank you for your help.{nl}I could've done more if only my condition was better...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013071	We saw a strange light on the way to a street near the ruins.{nl}We ran to it but we got caught up in the enchantment.{nl}Connor's injuries seem worse than mine, he should rest here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013072	I could've done more if only my condition was better... Clearly I need to train more.{nl}Let's go. I saw a strange light by a street near the ruins.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013073	I'm already exhausted, but I can't stop.{nl}Rescuing Melchioras is more important than my condition right now.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013074	To think he set up all these enchantments in the short time he ran away...{nl}Do we even have a chance to catch up to Delmore Rephaim?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013075	A light in Government Ruins...{nl}It feels odd somehow. What if something happened...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013076	That lousy enchantment...{nl}We shouldn't be wasting time here...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013077	I... I think my injuries are too serious.{nl}You'll have to fight Delmore Rephaim on my behalf...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013078	Everyone else should move now.{nl}It's just over the obstacle. Are you ready?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013079	This altar...{nl}It's just another one of Delmore Rephaim's dirty tricks.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013080	The altar is absorbing Melchioras' spirit.{nl}He did this because he knew we weren't just going to let it happen.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013081	I can't be stubborn anymore.{nl}Everything that happened was because of me...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013082	I'll take care of Melchioras, you go and chase Delmore Rephaim.{nl}And please... come back safely.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013083	Fortunately Melchioras is still breathing.{nl}It could have been worse had we arrived later.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013084	To think he resorted to something so low...{nl}It's getting late. We should hurry now.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013085	I'm a Sadhu now, but I used to train with the Bokor Master.{nl}I made a shaman doll back then, if only I could put that in Melchioras' place right now...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013086	It's not impossible, though.{nl}Let me give you my shaman doll; defeat some demons and collect their spirits here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013087	When you become a Bokor you start by making your own shaman doll.{nl}I just never thought I'd be using mine to save a life...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013088	Yane's suggestion sounds dangerous, but... I think we have no choice.{nl}I say we try that first while I try and think of other solutions.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013089	Thank you for saving me but...{nl}Right now you need to focus on... Delmore Rephaim...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013090	Hurry and find him... He's at the Odaginkas Vacant Lot...{nl}You have to stop him...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013091	I'm... losing my senses now...{nl}I'm sorry... for keeping you behind.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013092	Yane, stop being stubborn and take care of Melchioras.{nl}You're in worse condition than all of us, you should stay.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013093	We're lagging behind.{nl}Let's hurry and head to the Odaginkas Vacant Lot!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013094	It's over!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013095	What happened to Delmore Rephaim?{nl}What was all that light and the ground shaking...?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013096	Is that so...? So he had the end he deserved.{nl}I just don't know if this can appease all the Delmore Castle {nl}residents that are now with the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013097	Delmore Rephaim is gone but... I'm still worried about Melchioras.{nl}Shall we go back now?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013098	What... what happened to Delmore Rephaim?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013099	I see...{nl}I guess it went as expected from him then...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013100	Right before he escaped he seemed almost addicted to forbidden knowledge, you see.{nl}As if there was nothing that could stop him...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013101	And I followed him, knowing fully well he was an ally of the demons.{nl}But there was no match for his character, his thirst for knowledge.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013102	When I found out he was going to use the people of the Delmore Castle to make the Kruvina...{nl}Yes, had I been able to stop him then, everyone would have been saved...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013103	The reason I gathered the Revelators and came back here...{nl}Wasn't just to clear my conscience for not saving all those people.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013104	The Kruvina spore plan was going to happen at the Pelke Shrine Ruins...{nl}The rest of the spirits must have been sent to Letas Stream to be offered to the Divine Tree.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013105	The Kruvina is capable of much more horrendous deeds...{nl}Now the demons are going to try and create an even stronger one.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013106	The new Kruvina won't use humans, but a source of sacred power...{nl}The goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013107	That's why they have to be stopped. I didn't realize it at first but...{nl}I feel in you a power that is different from other Revelators.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013108	The only hope I have left is on you.{nl}Please, go to Seir Rainforest... put a stop to the demons' plans.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013109	Melchioras has managed to regain his conscience.{nl}Was it the work of the goddesses...? I'm so glad he's alive...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013110	Melchioras regained his conscience while we were fighting, it seems.{nl}I'm glad everything is going to be alright now. I really am.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013111	Melchioras was asking for you the whole time.{nl}I don't even know what to say, I'm so glad everything ended well...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013112	I hoped I could be the one to catch Delmore Rephaim...{nl}But I'm glad it turned out well. If only I wasn't hurt...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013113	Chasing away the demons, rebuilding the walls...{nl}I wonder how long it will take to make the Delmore Castle a place worth living again.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013114	The demons are going to try and make an even stronger Kruvina.{nl}The new Kruvina won't run on humans, but on a source of divine power... the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013115	I... I feel in you a power that's different from other Revelators.{nl}It makes me wonder if meeting you wasn't in fact the destiny granted to me by the goddesses...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013116	I think I might stay here for a while and repent.{nl}I just don't think I'll be able to move around much...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013117	Something is worrying me...{nl}You see, I didn't just make one Kruvina device. There were more.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013118	They may be unfinished, but those devices are still out there.{nl}I was wondering if you could help me destroy them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013119	Defeat some demons and collect their demonic power in this crystal.{nl}Once the crystal is full, insert it in the device. {nl}Its magic will colide with that of the device and destroy it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013120	Using the crystal depletes its magic, however, so you will have to fill it up again...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013121	When we were designing the Kruvina device...{nl}I had no idea it would be consuming the lives of the residents of the Delmore Castle.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013122	This was all due to my negligence.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013123	Kruvina...{nl}I can never forgive myself for what happened...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013124	What worries me, though...{nl}Do you remember?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013125	We didn't completely destroy the Magic Power Supply Device at Delmore Manor.{nl}I'm not trying to blame Yane, but we need to do something.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013126	We'll do it the same way as before.{nl}Defeat the demons and collect their power in the crystal.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013127	Use the crystal on the Magic Power Supply Device to destroy it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013128	I'm really not trying to blame Yane but...{nl}I just want to make sure we do things right.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013129	Thank you... so much.{nl}It should be impossible to create another Kruvina now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013130	I can't rid myself of my sins, nor can I take them back.{nl}All I can do is stay here and continue to repent.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013131	Nothing guarantees there won't another person like Delmore Rephaim in the future.{nl}Still, it's a pity what happened to the Delmore Castle...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013132	Thank you so much for rescuing Melchioras.{nl}I don't know what would be of this guilt if he hadn't made it...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013133	Thank you so much for rescuing Melchioras.{nl}I would not be able to handle the guilt if he hadn't made it...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013134	I know this was all the work of Delmore Rephaim but...{nl}Without help from the demons it would have been impossible.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013135	The only way is to nip the evil in the bud and destroy them all...{nl}But how? I can barely stand up right now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013136	Would you please help me and clear out a few Pags?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013137	Monsters are a threat too, but not as much as demons.{nl}Still, I believe the day will come when all demons are eradicated from this land.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013138	I, too, did Melchioras wrong.{nl}I want to stay and help him for a little longer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013139	I have nothing but gratitude for you.{nl}I will pray to the goddesses, that they may protect your every step.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013140	I met quite a lot of Revelators in Klaipeda.{nl}I don't know how to explain this feeling but... you're different, that's for sure.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013141	Say what you will, but it was thanks to you that this all came to an end.{nl}I wonder if you're not on a different, more important mission than the rest of us...{nl}It's just what I think.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013142	Yane may have commited a serious mistake, but she's still my ally.{nl}I'm going to stay here with her for a while and help Melchioras.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013143	Melchioras is safe now...{nl}And thanks to you, Delmore Rephaim was defeated, too. I'm glad it's all over.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013144	The problem now are the demons... They never seem to go away.{nl}Black Maizes are even carrying around magic amplifiers.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013145	Those amplifiers have given us a lot of trouble, {nl}but as a Sapper I can't help but take an interest in them.{nl}Would you collect some for me?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013146	It's hard to tell which ones have amplifiers.{nl}Just try and fight any Black Maizes that stand out to you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013147	The demons here seem more... should I say human?{nl}I think they might have shared some techniques with Delmore Rephaim.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013148	Oh, thank you.{nl}I should be able to tweak this and make a more powerful bomb.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013149	I heard the Order of the Tree of Truth had been blessed by the goddesses...{nl}But there's nothing but ghosts and monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013150	If you're staying in this graveyard, would you help me with something?{nl}I can't fight these ghosts, and the monsters come running in{nl}whenever they hear the sound of a prayer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013151	Would you take care of the monsters at the entrance?{nl}Meanwhile I'm going to pray and ask that the goddesses be found.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013152	Oh, you're back.{nl}Thanks to you my prayer wasn't disturbed by the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013153	But the dead have started to come back to life after they've come here.{nl}There can be no greater insult if it was done on purpose!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013154	I got hurt earlier while running away from the ghosts and it's hard to move around.{nl}Would you help me with something?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013155	Maybe because of Margiris' divine power...{nl}Sometimes the followers in Seima Stone Chamber do come back from the dead.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013156	The followers who come back can't forget the regrets they had in life and wander here.{nl}Use this flint and grant them eternal peace.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013157	Thank you for your help so far.{nl}By the way, the spirit rock you filled up earlier... please take this to Margiris.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013158	Margiris is on the way to Carlyle's Mausoleum.{nl}With the spirit rock you should have no problems in joining our Order.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013159	Who are you?{nl}Oh, that's the spirit rock I gave Gintas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013160	I'm getting better now, I should be able to move again if I just rest for a while.{nl}Take care and see you again some time.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013161	The spirit rock seems to have calmed down those hideous things.{nl}Clearly the spirits of those who rest here want them gone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013162	Now we must imprint the aura to defile the graveyard into the spell doll.{nl}There were some black crystals that I hadn't seen before where we burned the dead.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013163	Are you the Revelator Leja talked about?{nl}And that's... our food that got stolen.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013164	Like I said earlier, we can't trust you just yet.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013165	There is a totem that we don't even dare get close to because of its evil energy.{nl}If you really are a Revelator, then you should be able to destroy it with your divine power.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013166	Show us.{nl}If you really are a Revelator, that is...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013167	You... you're a true Revelator, there's no doubt about it.{nl}I feel so sorry for how I treated you earlier... Please forgive this old man.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013168	Medzio Diena didn't cause much damage here, but that was only the beginning.{nl}You see, not long ago our river turned red.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013169	Hurry and follow the light.{nl}This can only be a sign sent by Goddess Laima to guide you in the right direction.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013170	Ah... And we can't let them know in Fedimian...{nl}We're in a really tough spot.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013171	The totem is at the Banaga Forest Trail.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013172	If you really are a Revelator that came here with the light to save our town...{nl}Then you should be able to take back the ferrets' hideout.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013173	If you can prove that you are in fact a Revelator, I will tell you where to find Leja.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013174	Just a moment.{nl}I'll give it to you right away.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013175	Zaura is making something evil called Kruvina using Goddess Lada's vital force.{nl}The same Kruvina the people of the Delmore Castle were sacrificed to make.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013176	Would you spread this scent around the Bellai Forest Workshop?{nl}It smells a bit... foul, but please do me this favor.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013177	Not the lives of people... Hers. The goddess' life.{nl}That's why such a large amount of water contaminated by the Kruvina was needed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013178	The amount of scent I made is only enough for about three uses.{nl}Make sure you only use it when it's absolutely necessary.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013179	Help...? It's not something I haven't thought about.{nl}The city closest to here is Fedimian.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013180	I heard Fedimian was devastated after Medzio Diena, though.{nl}Even after four years, it's still being reconstructed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013181	And Goddess Lada, she said that no matter what happens to her...{nl}She would never make her presence known to anyone but the Revelators.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013182	As you know...{nl}People now think that the goddesses have all disappeared.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013183	But if they find out that the goddesses are still around...{nl}You can imagine what a shock that would be.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013184	That's why only you, a Revelator, can save Goddess Lada.{nl}The goddess said so herself, too...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013185	We want to ask for help, too. We want it more than anyone.{nl}Be it Orsha... or Fedimian, which is closer... But that's just something we can't do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013186	Orsha is too far away, and Fedimian is still recovering from Medzio Diena.{nl}Besides... that's not what Goddess Lada wants.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013187	She thinks that people will be too confused if they find out about her.{nl}I don't know why that would be so confusing, but if she says so, we must follow her will.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013188	Ow, ouch...{nl}Those darned ferrets have some sharp nails...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013189	Our village doesn't usually welcome outsiders...{nl}It's best if you don't expect much kindness from people here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013190	Your face doesn't look familiar...{nl}Please don't cause a commotion and just move along.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013191	The Story of Karolis Vol. 2
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013192	Karolis, on his way to find a place to set up Tesla's owl sculptures, came across a forest that seemed to gather evil energy.{nl}He began to wonder whether he could do something about it himself, when a girl came to him.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013193	The girl merely spoke, but somehow Karolis seemed to understand her.{nl}And so, like the girl instructed him, Karolis built a number of altars throughout the forest and stopped the evil energy from spreading.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013194	The Demon Lord, as expected, could not let him get away with that.{nl}He called on his demons to destroy the altars and set out to look for Karolis.{nl}Karolis took Sequoia and try to resist to the best of his strength, but it was useless.{nl}The Demon Lord was that much more powerful.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013195	Eventually even the Sequoia that he so dearly protected was contaminated with evil energy, as Karolis and the girl saw themselves surrounded more and more closely by the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013196	I'm sorry I doubted you.{nl}It's just that our town has been hurt by fake Revelators before...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013197	Goddess Lada being taken by the demons...{nl}None of that would have happened if we hadn't believed the fake Revelators.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013198	And with our water turning red we felt more and more powerless...{nl}We should have realized our mistake and gone to the real Revelators, but...{nl}I'm so sorry.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013199	What are you still doing here?{nl}You're going to miss the girl. Hurry and go after her.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013200	Who are you? I've never seen you before...{nl}Our men are too tired. If you have no business here, would you mind not bothering us?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013201	So you're a Revelator, like the ones in the legends?{nl}Wow... I really didn't know!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013202	Want to go see the ferrets? They love meat jerky.{nl}It must be dangerous, but I'm curious...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013203	Who are you? Is this your first time here?{nl}Did you get permission from my grandfather?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013204	A real Revelator... I heard about you from the village priest.{nl}He says he was in danger and you came to save him with a light?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013205	That light... I want to see it too!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013206	Oh... So the ferrets became more aggressive after the statue was set up?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013207	Maybe it's because the statue is not completed yet...{nl}I feel so sorry for bothering Widas now...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013208	I'm sorry but... if you have no business here, you better leave now.{nl}The atmosphere in the village isn't good...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013209	I saw it. The bright glowing light that came with you.{nl}If it wasn't for that I would have been attacked by the ferrets.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013210	But who was that girl, I wonder...?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013211	If you're done here I think you should go.{nl}This village is done anyways...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013212	I almost made another big mistake, didn't I?{nl}I'm sorry. All of these tragedies happening in our village have really ruined our mood.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013213	We were worried about the river turning red...{nl}Then a demon disguised as a Revelator... It was my fault for not realizing...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013214	Because of the demon Goddess Lada was taken away, {nl}and our people didn't have the power to do anything...{nl}I'm so sorry... I hope you will understand...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013215	If you ever meet that demon, be careful.{nl}It knows how to act and look like a person, you can't even tell it's not human.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013216	No... This isn't it...{nl}Hm? Stop interrupting and go away. You're distracting me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013217	Our village has had a really bad experience with a demon before.{nl}It came to us pretending to be a legendary Revelator.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013218	Of course believing it was our mistake but...{nl}We never thought we'd see an actual Revelator after that.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013219	This thing about the ferrets... It feels like when we were tricked into making that demon totem...{nl}I'll try and start over again.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013220	Hm? Revelator, did you speak with our village chief?{nl}Let me take a look here first, you go and help the villagers.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013221	If Zaura didn't want you and the girl to meet...{nl}Then she might just be the key to rescuing Goddess Lada.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013222	Do you remember?{nl}What happened when you first came to help me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013223	If you hadn't saved me then...{nl}We wouldn't be able to save Goddess Lada either.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013224	As you know, Laima is the goddess of fate and foresight.{nl}I believe she's the one who put you in my path.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013225	Thank you very much.{nl}I expect this red water will have cleared out by the time you visit our village again.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013226	Finding out Goddess Lada is safe is the best news I've heard since Medzio Diena.{nl}Seeing all the commotion with the ferrets, however, I better finish the statue soon.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013227	Thank you so much for rescuing Goddess Lada!{nl}And our village!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013228	I can't believe the Demon Lord was defeated! {nl}And thanks to you the ferrets aren't stealing out food anymore.{nl}Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013229	Thank you. I'm so grateful to you and to Goddess Lada for having sent you.{nl}You are a blessing to our village.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013230	Huh, an outsider? You must be new here...{nl}Those ferrets may look cute, but they'll shred your face to pieces if you're not careful.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013231	I don't know what the demons did to those ferrets but...{nl}Seeing how they attack, avoiding a fight must be impossible, right?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013232	Finally that Demon Lord was defeated...{nl}And Goddess Lada was rescued... Thank you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013233	Thanks to you now we can focus on the ferrets.{nl}I still don't know about the red water, but we'll find an answer eventually.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013234	I know it was Goddess Laima who sent us a Revelator, but...{nl}Still, I think everything worked out even better because of you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013235	I'm very thankful for everything.{nl}For saving me, and for rescuing Goddess Lada too.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013236	Now that we know Goddess Lada is safe, I want to build a shrine with the villagers.{nl}I have faith that, with the power if the goddess, our river will become clear again. It will.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013237	I never thought everything Goddess Laima predicted would become true.{nl}The disaster happening... even the Revelator coming to save us from it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013238	And yet the disaster happened, and now you saved our village and Goddess Lada.{nl}I should have been the one to keep the faith when our village was down, but I didn't.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013239	So all of that work was in vain...{nl}Thank you for making me realize that before it was too late...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013240	Thanks to you Goddess Lada is safe.{nl}She's lost her power now but... I know she'll get it back someday.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013241	I know you'll do well no matter what path you chose.{nl}I've seen the miracles you're capable of with my own eyes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013242	Goddess Laima is leading you to be the savior of the world, I can tell.{nl}May your every step receive the blessing of the goddesses...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013243	Our savior... The future of this world depends on your journey...{nl}Now go... Follow Laima's revelations and walk the path of salvation...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013244	Hey, you.{nl}If you're going inside the shrine, can you give me a hand?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013245	I need to go to where the villagers are but...{nl}I don't know, there's just so many monsters here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013246	It was hard enough coming all the way up here.{nl}And those no-good youngsters won't even come out to help an old man.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013247	So you left me out, is it?{nl}You think you can sort out this red water problem all by yourselves?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013248	Who do you take the village chief for? You lousy youngsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013249	Anyway, since it came to this...{nl}If your skills are okay, will you take down some monsters?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013250	Youngsters these days don't respect their elders anymore.{nl}What can they do by themselves?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013251	Where's the respect for the village chief?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013252	Yes, yes.{nl}You're much better than the youngsters in our village.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013253	Seems like you're no nobody, hey?{nl}The young ones in our village can't kill monsters that easily.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013254	Ugh, grandpa...{nl}How many times have I told you to stay home? It's dangerous to go out on you own...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013255	Thank you for looking after my grandfather.{nl}I heard you're very talented, is it?{nl}Anyway, if it's you... Hm...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013256	We live in a village down from here.{nl}The water here runs all the way down to our village, you see.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013257	One day, our crops started to grow a lot bigger than usual.{nl}Of course the village thought it was a blessing from the goddesses but... that didn't last long.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013258	The crops were inedible. Every single one of them.{nl}The problem wasn't the taste, but everyone who ate them ended up bedridden, it was chaos.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013259	On top of that, all the water in the village turned red.{nl}And just like the crops... No one could drink it anymore.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013260	Eventually some people left for Orsha, thinking the village had been cursed...{nl}Those who stayed decided to follow the river and ended up here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013261	But even among all of us, we have no idea what to do.{nl}People are starting to grow tired, too...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013262	My grandfather praised you to the skies, he's really impressed by your talent.{nl}That's why I'm asking you. Please help our village.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013263	I'm sure you'll be able to find a solution if you just use some of your power.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013264	Thank you for being so helpful.{nl}The first thing I want to ask of you is... to investigate the Wandering Sanctuary.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013265	Not that long ago my grandfather went out there by himself.{nl}He ended up surrounded by monsters and... It was a close call.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013266	There were a few objects strewn around that I'd never seen before.{nl}I think my grandfather was there to investigate them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013267	Found something in the heap of ashes.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013268	I know I should take you there myself, but I feel like I'll just be a burden.{nl}That day, too, all we did was get grandpa and run away from there.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013269	You're back.{nl}Did you see anything odd?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013270	This... looks like a diary.{nl}I'll try and save whatever parts I can make out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013271	Meanwhile, could you look for my grandfather? {nl}The ground trembled all of a sudden and he went with some people from the village.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013272	I asked them not to let him go anywhere...{nl}And now they take him with them, honestly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013273	Huh, what do you know.{nl}I owe you another one, eh? Thank you, thank you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013274	But this I know for sure.{nl}Something big is happening at the Wandering Sanctuary, I tell you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013275	You still can't find my grandfather?{nl}Sigh... If you do find him, make sure to bring him here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013276	This is it, this disc.{nl}You know how the ground trembled earlier?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013277	The disc suddenly started glowing red so I followed it all the way here.{nl}I was chased away by monsters, but I clearly saw that it was pointing to something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013278	I'm going to give the disc to you; will you check where it's pointing to?{nl}My friend here got hurt so we're going to back together.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013279	My friend got hurt trying to protect me so we should stick together.{nl}Please do me this favor.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013280	So the disc was pointing to this red statue? {nl}Hm... I've never seen this before.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013281	Let me take a closer look at it, then.{nl}Who knows what else I'll be able to find.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013282	I should go to the Absenta Reservoir.{nl}I remember Modis once said that there was a group of people in black hoods headed there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013283	Go see my granddaughter before you come along.{nl}She said something about a diary...?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013284	experiment succeeded...{nl}... ...{nl}... results... protecting vessel is alive...{nl}...vina's power... Reservoir... spread... contaminate...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013285	... ...{nl}...Seir Rainforest... Novaha Mona...{nl}... ...{nl}... annihilate... ...proceed with the pla...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013286	Sigh, it wasn't easy. This is all I was able to recover.{nl}Almost all the pages are completely burnt.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013287	All I understand is that...{nl}Some sort of power spread throughout the reservoir.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013288	I wonder if that's why the water turned red, but I can't be sure...{nl}The vessel is alive... This part sounds strange, too.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013289	I have no idea about the rest.{nl}Any guesses?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013290	Anyway, enough with the diary...{nl}You should go and follow my grandfather to the Absenta Reservoir.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013291	You're back?{nl}Ah, my granddaughter, all she does is worry about me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013292	Oh, of course.{nl}Can you tell me about what was in the diary?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013293	I saw it.{nl}Before the water turned red, there were people praying here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013294	Those fools in the village think it was because of something else...{nl}But I'm convinced there are goddesses we don't know about.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013295	The goddesses must have gotten angry because no one believes them.{nl}I'm sure offering them a tribute would appease them...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013296	So I was thinking about offering them some monster meat.{nl}Would you help me?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013297	The crops in our village were all contaminated by the red water so we can't eat them.{nl}I can't offer that to the goddesses, right?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013298	You got it!{nl}Thank you so much for helping me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013299	I'm going to make an offering and pray to this obelisk.{nl}Oh, there's another obelisk somewhere.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013300	I'll tell you where it is so you can go and pray there, yes?{nl}If we solve this I'm sure you'll be generously rewarded by our people.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013301	The other obelisk is on the left side of the Vishikas Great Hall.{nl}I'll stay here and pray, then. You go now.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013302	Have I made the offering, you ask?{nl}No, I only prayed so far... Why?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013303	What? You mean the monsters suddenly ran to the offering?{nl}Huh?... That's impossible...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013304	I'm sure I saw those people praying.{nl}They were wearing black hoods... I really saw them...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013305	Hm... I'm confused.{nl}That's what I told everyone, what am I going to say now...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013306	You didn't see a young man called Napalis, did you?{nl}He went out a while ago and hasn't been back since. I'm worried about him now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013307	He said he was headed to the Drava Chapel Lot.{nl}If you're going that way, would you mind checking in on him?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013308	Why did he have to go out at a time like this.{nl}I sure hope nothing happened...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013309	Napalis
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013310	You saved my life.{nl}I was being chased by that huge monster and had to hide in here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013311	I should go back to where the others are.{nl}Thank you so much for saving me!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013312	Nothing... Nothing terrible happened, I hope?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013313	Looking at that red water makes me feel terrible.{nl}It's not even good to drink... not to mention it ruined our crops.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013314	The waste was monumental.{nl}Our vegetables grew huge, but they were all left to rot as we couldn't eat them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013315	Everyone in the village was ready to go out and find the reason why the water turned red, but...{nl}The only person who has actually fought any monsters is Modis, the hunter.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013316	I saw you fight those monsters earlier and you were really good.{nl}If that's okay, will you clear out some monsters around here?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013317	We should be fine if we just stick together...{nl}I hope we don't run into trouble on our way to the village.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013318	So it was right, what I saw. I knew it.{nl}Thank you!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013319	I still feel a little uneasy, though...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013320	The ground trembling... it seems odd.{nl}I wonder if it's related to the experiment...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013321	Oh, right, my grandfather! I forgot about him.{nl}Please go back to the Absenta Reservoir, I don't want him to get in trouble again.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013322	A vessel? That's odd.{nl}Someone was doing an experiment here... is that what you mean?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013323	Hm... I never heard about any demons doing any sort of experiments...{nl}But it could be related to those black hoods that Modis saw.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013324	I told you I saw them walking in and out of the Nesuga Small Corridor.{nl}Would you look into it?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013325	I hope we can find something this time, too.{nl}I don't think I can rest now that I know it was someone who did this.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013326	So, did you find anything?{nl}A picture? What is it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013327	Let's see... This looks like that red statue you found earlier.{nl}By the way, while you were gone I saw something strange.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013328	I was taking a closer look at that statue you brought and...{nl}Suddenly, the water on the bucket next to it turned red.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013329	Oh... the smell.{nl}If something like this exists but much bigger, then that must be what's tainting the water.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013330	Let's see, then... Where can we find something like this but big...{nl}If only we get rid of that, I'm sure the water will be back to normal.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013331	Also, the monster drawn on the bottom here got me thinking.{nl}I feel like I know this monster, but it looks different somehow.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013332	A Hydra... Go now!{nl}I'll be with you soon!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013333	Did I... Did I see that right?{nl}It looked like it had some sort of gem on its body.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013334	Hydras aren't usually that big, and their scales aren't red either.{nl}This monster... It looks exactly like the one on that painting you found.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013335	People have called that monster a mystical creature since long ago, but this is different.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013336	So that beast has a gem stuck on it now, huh?{nl}I'd say you'd have to get the beast out and kill it to get rid of the gem...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013337	Talking is easy. Do you know why they call it mystical?{nl}You can't just go and grab it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013338	Hm... That's if we count only the folk from our village.{nl}If you help us catch it I think we might just have a chance. What do you say?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013339	Right. Thank you.{nl}You want to talk to Modis, then.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013340	He's the best hunter in the village. I'm sure Modis can think of a way to lure to beast.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013341	Hunter Modis
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013342	So you're the one our village chief can't stop talking about.{nl}I'm really glad you decided to help us.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013343	Hunting is all the same, no matter the size of the beast.{nl}We just lure it into a trap with some bait and then tie its feet.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013344	Considering the size of this one, though, making the trap is going to take some time.{nl}Can you find some bait meanwhile?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013345	For the bait you want to get some Black Sawpent meat.{nl}We need some herbs too, to disguise our scent.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013346	If it wasn't for you, we would have never been able to deal with the Hydra.{nl}As you know most of us work as farmers.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013347	Did you get everything?{nl}I was able to make a nice, sturdy trap.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013348	We have a problem.{nl}One of the villagers went to see the chief and drank some water from the bucket.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013349	I told them to be careful, that the water was probably contaminated, but...{nl}I wish we had some sort of painkiller... Can you please get some herbs for us?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013350	This area is contaminated with the red water, you'll have to go to Svaigulys Hill in Letas Stream. {nl}Find some Markazi Flowers. They're yellow.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013351	I wish we knew how to cure this.{nl}Right now all we can do is try and relieve the pain.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013352	Oh, that's it.{nl}Let's hope our friend has learned their lesson now.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013353	It's revolting to think that this red water is all because of some experiment.{nl}Because of it our lives have been threatened.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013354	Why did the people in the black hoods do such a thing?{nl}I just want to burn down the whole laboratory so they can't even think of doing it again.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013355	Thing is... I can't fight the monsters and burn down the lab on my own.{nl}Our people want to leave as fast as possible.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013356	Why on earth would someone do an experiment like that?{nl}It's atrocious.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013357	Thank you.{nl}This should be enough to make the oil we need!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013358	Now, pour the oil around the laboratory and set it on fire.{nl}I hope this teaches them not to do another experiment here...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013359	So one of the laboratories is here at the Nesuga Small Corridor.{nl}There's another one in the Wandering Sanctuary at the Pelke Shrine Ruins.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013360	Those filthy people...{nl}Next time I see the black hoods I need to have a word with them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013361	Thank you.{nl}That makes me feel better.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013362	How can someone think of such a cruel experiment?{nl}How can they even... Am I right?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013363	Go see Modis.{nl}He's an expert at setting straps, you know.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013364	I set up the trap at the Heralve Vacant Lot. {nl}With the bait on it we should be able to catch the Hydra.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013365	Make sure you're ready for this, that beast is dangerous.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013366	I sure hope we're right after all.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013367	You're the only one we can trust now.{nl}I pray that the goddesses give us strength...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013368	You're back! How did it go?{nl}Did you destroy the gem?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013369	Good, good! Very good.{nl}That red statue you brought earlier suddenly exploded, gave me quite the scare.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013370	I don't expect the water to turn back to normal right away.{nl}It's going to take a while for all this water to become clean again.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013371	But things are getting better, I'm sure those who went to Orsha will come back.{nl}You really were a savior to our village!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013372	You're leaving already?{nl}Alright, just make sure you stay away from the Delmore Castle.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013373	I heard from one of our youngsters who went there...{nl}Apparently it's completely deserted and swarming with demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013374	Seems like they followed Orsha's immigration order, huh?{nl}No use in going to a place that's just full of demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013375	Anyway, thank you for everything.{nl}May the goddesses bless every step you take...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013376	The water's bright red, we can't drink it.{nl}And those darned youngsters don't even come out to help an old man.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013377	Isn't it weird? All the red water around here.{nl}Don't drink it, though. It'll make you sick to your stomach.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013378	The others don't seem to understand.{nl}It's clear the goddesses are upset.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013379	I'm also worried about the red water, and there's all these monsters around.{nl}Should I have just gone to Orsha...?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013380	We came here together to try and figure out this red water, but...{nl}It's too dangerous out here...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013381	Thank you so much for saving me.{nl}I should have stopped our chief... It was my mistake.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013382	This is the reservoir where the river begins.{nl}I think the source of the contamination might be somewhere around here.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013383	We need to find it and eliminate it as soon as possible.{nl}Otherwise our village is doomed.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013384	You went out there without me again, did you?{nl}We could have gone together if you'd just waited a little while.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013385	I'm going to give you the diary, but first let me explain what it says.{nl}Just take note of this and go find my grandfather right away.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013386	Just a while ago here I was, thinking I'm done for, unable to escape...{nl}Thinking about it, our chief must be a really brave man...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013387	(The ground is suddenly trembling.)

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013412	And that red gem Mardas saw...{nl}It must be somehow connected to what happened to the spirits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013413	From what I heard the water at the Pelke Shrine Ruins turned red...{nl}I wonder if that has something to do with that gem?

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013424	It's close to the Anga Hall.{nl}I'm glad you're not going out there on your own, but I have a bad feeling about this.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013425	The water all turned red, you can't get any around here.{nl}You need to go all the way to Letas Stream.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013430	If it goes well, tell the village chief immediately.{nl}May the goddesses bless you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013431	The waste was monumental.{nl}Our vegetables grew huge, but they were all left to rot as we couldn't eat them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013432	It's a huge relief.{nl}Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013433	A food offering would probably appease the goddesses...{nl}But all our crops were ruined by the red water, how can we offer that?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013434	The water should go back to normal now, right?{nl}That red water, the first time I saw it I was terrified...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013435	I think we need to keep an eye on this place to keep things like this from happening again.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013436	At first when our crops grew because of that red water everyone was delighted.{nl}We thought it was a blessing from the goddesses... Yet they were completely inedible.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013437	Napalis said you saved them from a really close call.{nl}I'm glad they're back to safety, but I can't guarantee things like this won't happen again.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013438	We all live in a village down from here.{nl}We came all the way here to try and see what's making the water... like this.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013439	I'm telling you, I saw people praying.{nl}They wore black hoods... I really saw them...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013440	Oh... So it was the gem on the Hydra that turned our water red.{nl}What could this gem be, to cause so much trouble...?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013441	What do you know, there's a gem on the beast.{nl}Anyway, with you and Modis here... destroying it won't be impossible.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013442	So the monster on the painting you brought in was a Hydra...{nl}And because of this one thing now we have this chaos from our village all the way to Zeraha.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013443	It will be a while before the water turns back to normal.{nl}But when it does, the people who went to Orsha should come back...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013444	I know the water is going to be fine now...{nl}But it's a shame we still don't know who did this or why they did it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013445	I do remember seeing some people with black hoods here doing something a while ago.{nl}To think that they're responsible for all of this... It's horrible.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013446	So the water turning red was because of that gem on the Hydra...{nl}It might have been mystical, but that was a long time ago.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013447	We're on the spot now, how and where do we even start...?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013448	Well, the Hydra may be a mystical creature, but it's no different from other game.{nl}The only difference is the size, and that weird gem it has on its body.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013449	I'd heard about the Hydra before, but I never realized how scary it was until now.{nl}To think you actually went and fought it... How impressive is that?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013450	That red water is no one's business but our village's.{nl}Outsiders would do well to leave us alone.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013451	I'm sorry I was rude to you earlier...{nl}Please forgive this old man's insolence.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151224_013452	May the Revelator who dreamt of chaos defeat the evil forces and bring light back into our world...{nl}If the legends are true, this red water will soon be no more.
