QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000420	Like when you are taming an eagle, how about feed it?{nl}I don't have high expectations so you better go there and try it first.{nl}I've put enough food so at least try on three different kinds of monsters.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000421	Did we fail. It's so bad, but I've expected it.{nl}Regardless of the outcomes, I will pay for your efforts.{nl}Good. I will teach you myself.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000426	I still regret for what I did in the past.{nl}I am helping some peolpe as a result, but if it becomes known to other people, I will be in a trouble.{nl}You have to send them a gift, if you do it well, I will teach you some skills.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000427	There are lots of people who blame me.{nl}But, I am not doing this task for those people.{nl}I am just taking my responsibility for my mistake.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000429	You've come here to get acknowledged by me?{nl}But, I have some matter to take care of now so it's little hard at the moment.{nl}The book of transactions has been ripped off due to the monsters.{nl}{nl}Because of this, I can't concentrate on other works.{nl}If you are in a hurry, then I will tell you the location so please get me the preliminary book.{nl}This is a secret, but I am telling you because of our relationship and I trust you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000430	The preliminary book is at 35_3 at the monastery.{nl}In order to prevent other people from finding it, I've hid it inside a book and there are some fake books as well so find it well.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000434	It seems that you are competent enough.{nl}As I promised to you, I will help you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000435	It seems that you have some business with me, but there is more important thing to do at the moment.{nl}The demonic power which was created from a far place is becoming stronger and begins to influence the power of Oracle.{nl}As a result, what we see through Clairvoyance is getting vague.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000436	We have to get rid of that demonic energy first.{nl}Why don't you try it first?{nl}Maybe, resolving this issue would verify your competence and can also be a test for you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151001_000437	The problem is occuring at Canyon Region 36_1.{nl}You just have to put the Romuva of Purification where the demonic energy is strong.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000897	Hmm, Have you ever seen the great cathedral or Mage Tower before?{nl}Or something like the gigantic goddess statue of Fedimian.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000898	Do you think a large construction like that can be completed by one individual?{nl}Of course not. It's hard to supply such materials even if the kingdom comes first.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000899	We are the merchants that supplied materials to the historic construction.{nl}Do you understand now?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000900	We helped for the completion of it.{nl}The objective of our merchants is the will of the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000901	Ah, I am in charge of newcomers of Kedora Merchants.{nl}We've received severe damages on Medizo Diena so even the newcomers are trying their best to restore the place.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000902	We are in a trouble.{nl}We have to put a notice board, but we are just too busy.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000903	We, Kedora Merchants act harsh on the newcomers.{nl}Especially, Leopoldas is really scary.. He wants me to do this alone.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000904	If that's so, can you put this notice board on Krive Highway?{nl}Editar leader is excavating this sacred object.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000905	I am counting on you to do this secretly without being detected by Leopoldas.{nl}I have to go somewhere.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000906	I am counting on you to do this secretly without being detected by Leopoldas.{nl}For sure.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000907	I am helping the revelators who just started their journies from Kedora Merchants.{nl}If you are okay, can you help us?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000908	It's not that difficult.{nl}You just have to pass the blessing which is needed for their journies.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000909	Thank you.{nl}Then, I will tell you how you can do it.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000910	Please look for the revelator who just started their journies around Orsha and Klaipeda.{nl}When you this scroll to him, he will receive the blessing that is needed for the journey.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000911	Ah, and it won't be effective to the one who is already blessed so you please keep that in mind.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000912	We can't just rely on the goddess.{nl}We should do it ourselves in order to reduce the burden on the goddesses.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000913	We, Kedora Merchants helped the goddesses secretly until now.{nl}But, since the world turned into a chaos, we are going to help her actively.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000914	We are in a trouble..{nl}There are so many things to retrieve, but I don't know what people are doing.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000915	Ah, so Leopoldas sent you here?{nl}Finally, he is not insisting anymore.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000916	Long time ago, I was sending the sacred objects to Fedimina.{nl}But, I never knew that day was Medizo Diena.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000917	It was such a mess.{nl}They took care of urgent matters in other regions and they now came out to retrieve the sacred objects.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000918	Okay so let's stop complaining. I want you to retrieve the sacred objects from Goyanar Forest Way.{nl}I believe that they are buried deep in the ground.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000919	Ah, and there are many monsters around that threaten us, merchants.{nl}If this okay for you, I want you to defeat them as well.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000920	Be careful since there are many monsters around there.{nl}If there weren't any monsters, our task would not have been completed this late.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000921	Leopoldas never asks someone for help.{nl}I never knew that you were this good.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000922	Actually, we received a strange report.{nl}The monsters at Krive Highway are digging only one spot.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000923	I think what they are looking for is one of our Merchants' obejct.{nl}And it would take some time until the retrieval group reaches here.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000924	Is it the sacred obejct?{nl}It's been such a long time so I can't think of anything else.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000925	Those are the records from the merchants.{nl}They are ripped off badly.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000926	I am sure the monsters created this mess.{nl}Give it to me.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000927	Let's see.{nl}It is about..{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000928	This is the book about the materials for the arrow.{nl}Long time ago, they were supplied to Lydia Schaffen and the first Fletcher Master.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000929	I thought it was the sacred object that was lost long ago, it's an unexpected gift.{nl}It is said that the arrow of Lydia Schaffen has some special power in it.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000930	It is hard to restore it myself.. {nl}I should put it somewhere in the safe place and restore it when I go back to the headquarter.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000931	The remaining spot should be somewhere around Juikas Field.. but, I have no idea where it is exactly.{nl}If you are okay, can you help me on this one?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000932	I will give you the detector so please see how it reacts to it.{nl}It will only react on the marks that were put on by merchants so you won't
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000933	Isn't this really a good method?{nl}We put marks on all objects of the Merchants to prepare for the cases that they may get lost.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000934	Ahah, you've found the most important object!{nl}This is the mysterious ink.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000935	This is the secret ink which you use when you have to hide the records.{nl}It is very expensive as a result.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000936	You've been a great help to me so far.{nl}We will take care of the rest!{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000937	Leopoldas?{nl}Ah, he is our brother. What's the matter?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000938	He sent you to help me?{nl}I can't believe it.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000939	Well, anyways, it's good.{nl}That damn monster took away everything.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000940	Other things are fine, but the problem is the teaching materials for the newcomers.{nl}If we don't have those, we have to work from the beginning.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000941	You've seen the newcomers who Leopoldas manages right?{nl}These are the documents to educate those newcomers.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000942	Well, we, merchants support the will of the goddesses, but we moved secretly from behind.{nl}But, we can't stand anymore since the world is like this.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000943	That's why we've decided to hire new people and participate more actively.{nl}But, since the world is like this, we can't just do nothing.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000944	Anyways, if you are going to help me, please get me those documents again.{nl}If we don't have those, it would become complicated.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000945	It's not going to be over even if we find all those documents.{nl}Get ready since we also have to create the manuscript.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000946	I know the good meaning of it, but I am not sure if we are going to survive.{nl}If so, we are not doing something that we hadn't done before so it doesn't matter.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000947	Fighting against monsters are not something rare.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000948	Good. Our brother send us a good helper.{nl}Let's make the manuscript now.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000949	I will do the writing anyways so you don't have to worry.{nl}What I need is the ink.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000950	If there's an ink that is made up the body fluid from the monsters, it would last long.{nl}I will give you the trap so I am counting on you for the monster body fluid.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000951	Put the trap on the way that monsters cross.{nl}When monsters faint out after stepping on the trap, get the body fluid.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000952	Ah, this is the trick that only works at Droze Empty Lot so you should only put the trap there.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000953	You've already obtained all of them?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000954	I knew it. We still need more.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000955	This is enough.{nl}You've done well so far.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000956	If we meet next time, I will treat you a lot from our merchants,.{nl}I will do the rest so go back.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000957	Hello.{nl}Have you ever heard of Nestoses?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000958	Well, it doesn't really matter even if we didn't hear anything about it.{nl}They only concentrate on their religious belief quietly.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000959	I am one of those Nestoses.{nl}Prayers are good, but I am making a tombstone to see if that's going to help the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000960	I am trying to get rid of the evil energy and send only sacred energy to the goddess.{nl}But, I am having a problem collecting materials. {nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000961	Can you help me?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000962	There are too many materials.{nl}Listen well.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000963	
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000964	I can't just stand still even if I can't fact demons directly.{nl}Everyone does his/her own task.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000965	Goold. Well done.{nl}Now the materials are all collected.. We need some special tools.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000966	Good. Since you've helped me until now, why don't you make a tombstone yourself?{nl}Your name will be reached to the goddess with the sacred power.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000967	Just do your best to make a shape.{nl}How about it? Do you want to try it?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000968	Make it beautiful.{nl}I will do the rest so don't worry too much.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000969	
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000970	I don't know how many tombstones we are going to make..{nl}But, when you see this kind of tombstone from now on, please remember that there are people like us.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000971	The kingdom hasn't been collapsed by the demons yet.{nl}If we do our best, we would be able to find the peace.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000972	Ah, up there, We need help from Gierda near Baderam Hill.{nl}If you are okay, I want you to help me.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000973	Do you have any business with me?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000974	Antanas has asked you to help me?{nl}That's good. I am compiling the scripture of the goddesses here.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000975	We should have something that we can rely on when we are facing diffculties like nowadays.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000976	The scripture helped that.{nl}We should calm us down by reading the words of the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000977	We should first collect the materials to compile the scripture.{nl}Normal sheets become yellow and break.. We are trying to compile it with new materials now.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000978	Transparent shells of monsters are good.{nl}When we engrave letters on them, they last long.{nl}Could you get me those?{nl}{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000979	Those are easy to find.{nl}Okay, then I am counting on you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000980	Everyone needs something to rely one.{nl}But the goddesses.. {nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000981	Yes.{nl}We should be like a big tree that can be relied on.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000982	You've brought them sooner than I expected.{nl}This shell would become the scripture after polising it up. Thank you.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000983	To make the scripture, sheets are important, but binding is also important.{nl}Especially, the strings. It will be no good if the scripture gets untied.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000984	The string that is made up of the leather of monster is the best, but the problem is that it is short.{nl}I will give you a Moru so can you make a leather string for the binding?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000985	We should first obtain leather strings from monsters.{nl}After that, we will use this Moru to make a string for the binding.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000986	We will connect short ones to make a long string for the binding.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000987	I've learned the binding from Orsha long time ago.{nl}But, the task is too much with my own power.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000988	Ah! What should I do? what should I do..{nl}Without it, I won't know if I am a Nestos or Anastos.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000989	I am done. done.{nl}Since the pilgrim is over, I am trying to go to Pasaka Canyon, but I've done it again.{nl}Ahah.. I don't want to do this..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000990	Yes? Ah, I didn't know you were there. I am sorry.{nl}I am now. Ah.. too desperate.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000991	My luggage is gone.{nl}In fact what's inside are potato dumplings, books and etc, but the sign of Nestos.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000992	Ah.. really. The sign of Nestos is most important.{nl}That is so important to me.. I am sure the monsters have taken it.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000993	What should I do..{nl}How would I see the faces of Nestoses..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000994	That's it!{nl}Wow, you've collected all of them!{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000995	How can I pay for this?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000996	I was talking gibberish right?{nl}I am so sorry. I was too desperate so I wanted to give up on everything.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000997	This sign is like a sacred object to us.{nl}This is the symbol that we gained lots of diverse knowledge and passed many ordeals.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000998	We should go back.{nl}We won't lose it again right?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_000999	Ah...{nl}Antanas and Gierda keeps them well, but I don't undertand why I am losing them so often.{nl}I think I possess some secret power that pulls monsters..{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001000	Anyways, I will go to Pasaka Canyon now where the masters are present!{nl}Thank you so much!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001001	In order to collect the sacred power, we should possess some necessary tools.{nl}As you can see, I am not a priest who has been training for a long time.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001002	I've ordered some special hammer and chisel. {nl}Since the due date has reached, can you get me those?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001003	Normal tools won't work.{nl}If they work, I wouldn't have asked for your help.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001004	Did Antanas send you?{nl}His orders are too difficult..{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001005	Other blacksmiths would have problem fulfilling his orders.{nl}Here is the hammer. Are you going to engrave the sacred spell into it?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001006	Chisel?{nl}I don't sell chisels so I've asked someone else to prepare for him.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001007	Go meet Yula.{nl}She works at the equipment shop.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001008	See you again later.{nl}You are going to repair your equipment here from now on right?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001009	Welcome!{nl}The best equipment shop in Orsha!{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001010	Chisel?{nl}Are you talking about the chisel which Illanai has given to you?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001011	Good. Receive it.{nl}I guess your religious belief in the goddesses is strong.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001012	Yula has the chisel.{nl}She works at the equipment shop.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001013	Oh, you've made it well according to the order.{nl}Now, I guess I can get to work.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001014	Do you still have things to order?{nl}You can just take a look around so please visit here often.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001015	Have you found the chisel?{nl}I welcome orders like this so please keep visit our shop.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001016	What do you think?{nl}Why don't you help us if you think eliminating demons is important even if our objectives are different from each other.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001017	First of all, there are many polluted tombstones.{nl}I will break these so I want you to break the polluted tombstone at Usas Hill.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001018	I think that tombstone is also spurting out the red energies.{nl}Like the tombstone beside. That's the proof of the pollution.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001019	I can't understand.{nl}Albinas? Are you the member of Anastoses?{nl}That doesn't make sense?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001020	It's not like that I know everyone in Anastoses..{nl}They belong to the same religious body so I know them well.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001021	No way, bring him here at once! {nl}I will have to check it myself!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001022	
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001023	
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001024	While I am polishing up the materials, I don't want to see your face.{nl}How about defeating the monsters that make the place around here messy.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001025	Since everything is done, go back to Damiyonas with this.{nl}Do not ever do it again.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001026	You've obtained it. Now, I will start the recovery.{nl}It is fortunate that the damage wasn't severe.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001027	We and Anastoses have different opinions, but we are not hostile to each other.{nl}But, since the unknown name came out, it is so apparent that we suspect it.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001028	And you even broke the tombstone.{nl}Anyways, since you've done your responsibility, I will forgive you.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001029	Don't you feel it's unfair to just let it go?{nl}Since there's a camp of Anastoses up there, go there and ask.{nl}It's really strange.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001030	Yes, I am Anastoses'.. yes that's right.{nl}What brought you here?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001031	Sorry, I can't answer your questions at the moment since I am too busy at the moment..{nl}If you can find my research documents, I may get some spare time..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001032	Instead of blind devotion, a life of eliminating demons and preparing for chaos..{nl}I mean those kind of things.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001033	This is truly strange.{nl}I should send one of my colleagues to find it out.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001034	Ah, by the way, I am thinking about giving him a flare to prepare for any danger, but{nl}There aren't any adequate flares.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001035	Can you get us the powders that burn well in the fire?{nl}There are so many monsters around so it won't be hard to obtain the materials.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001036	Let's wait for the investigation results.{nl}He is a competant lad so he will find it out soon.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001037	Since we can't just stand still, how about we find it out ourselves as well?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001038	Good. Barte may have seen something.{nl}He recently joined our camp.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001039	How about you ask her about Albinas?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001040	Albinas?{nl}I saw someone with the apperances like your explanations near Majiva grave field.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001041	When you go back to Majiva Grave Field, that leather may be still there.{nl}I.. even if the goddesses tell me to go, I can't since I am too scared.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001042	What's the matter?{nl}I can't think anyone who would use that pattern except for the subordinate of Vaiga.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001043	We better let other people know this fast.{nl}You let Gedak know!{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001044	Please, save Paviyus!{nl}Ah, before that, we better go back to Nestoses!{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001045	The divine water, please take it.{nl}You will get at least one chance of using it on the demons.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001046	So you were safe.{nl}I've heard about Albinas from Paviyus.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001047	Do you think that makes sense?{nl}You broke the well working tombstone and you are saying there is no tombstone?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001048	What do you want me to say?{nl}I have a headache due to the tombstone so don't talk to me.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001049	It is so fortunate that the divine water I gave to you was helpful.{nl}It gives me goose bumps to think that the demons are within humans and alienate.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001050	Can you tell Damiyonas about this?{nl}I think they must be protecting the broken tombstone near Usas Hill.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001051	I was able to protect the consipiracy of the demons because of you.{nl}I thought we may have been seperated.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001052	Oh. That's right.{nl}Is there anything you found out about Albinas?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001053	I am sure there are people who fell into their alienating.{nl}They are trying to break them from inside..{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001054	Anyways, thank you.{nl}I hope the goddesses bless you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001055	Albinas has disappeared! What's going on?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001056	What, Are you interested in the revelation?{nl}But, there arent anything besides those writings..{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001057	First, you bring their attention as Eminent tells you to.{nl}At the same time, let's activate the magic field at Paramizo Battle field secrelty with me.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001058	You guys should be punished according to kingdom orders in principle.{nl}But, since you've saved our lives and many of our collegues have failed..{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001059	The safety of our colleagues comes first instead of your punishment.{nl}If you could help me retrieving the headquarter, then I will not ask you why you've entered here.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001060	I will prepare the magic with the memories of the spirits so you go to Ataka Side Road.{nl}Bring everything you can.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001061	I've seen the magic fields were activating. You are okay right? {nl}How about Eminent?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001062	The space which the tyrant who you've asked threw away is probably.. {nl}It is the prison that was made in the era of Kadumel era. {nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001063	Restoring the magic field was the duty of Hix, but we have no other way since he is injured.{nl}Also everyone is getting tired due to the coldness.. I want to lend your power.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001064	You are better than Hix.{nl}I want to ask you one more time.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001065	I met the monsters while returning with the message.{nl}I think I can move if I take little more rest, but this message should be delivered fast..{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001066	You seem competent as a swordsman.{nl}Do you have any plans to reach a higher stage?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001067	First, show me your skills.{nl}From the Linked Bridges, come back after defeating 10 Lapflammers and 10 Lapemans.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001068	If you train hard, it won't be that hard.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001069	Good.{nl}You look competent enough to progress to the next level.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001070	Are you the one who wants to walk the way of Highlander?{nl}Then, you should pass the test.{nl}I don't have time to waste on someone who is not worthy enough.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001071	The main weapon of the Highlander are the two handed swords. They are strong, but you should possess enough power to hold the swords.{nl}Attack the practice pole near it and I will test how strong you are.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001072	Attack the practice pole near me.{nl}I will evaluate how strong you are.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001073	Hmm... It seems that you won't have a big problem.{nl}If you pass one more test, I will teach the skills of Highlander.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001074	Your power seems to be enough.{nl}Now, I will check how you use that power well.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001075	With you skills, Lapflammers at Paupys Dock won't be hard.{nl}When you come back after defeating 10 of them, I will open the way of Highlander to you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001076	Come back after defeating Lapflammers at Paupys Dock.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001077	Your competence won't do any harm to Highlanders' fame.{nl}My father who is a master would say the same thing.{nl}On behalf of the master, I will teach you the skills of Highlander.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001078	You want to become a Peltasta? That's a wise decision.{nl}Let me ask one question to you. Do you hate the demons?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001079	Good. The most basic requirements have been fulfilled.{nl}We, Peltastas use the shield aggressively to face against the enemies.{nl}So you must have the basic understanding of using the shield.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001080	Please get me the materials to make a shield.{nl}From Lapeman
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001081	
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001082	Well done.{nl}When you obtain the manual for the shield in the future, I want you to make it yourself by collecting the materials yourself.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001083	Welcome to the world of Peltastas.{nl}Let's do our best until we defeat all the demons!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001084	It's always good to see new brothers and sisters.{nl}Can you help the villagers here with me?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001085	It's not good since Lapemans are keep giving the villagers pain at Linked Bridges.{nl}In fact, I want to punish them myself.{nl}But, Rosaliya... told me that I should not leave Orsha.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001086	On behalf of me, please correct the bad habit of Lapezards and Lapemiter.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001087	I am just doing my important duty which I've received from Master.{nl}I am not jealous of your journey!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001088	Have you completed the mission?{nl}You would be able to become a higher level Cleric.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001089	I welcome any brothers or sisters who would walk the way of Krivi.{nl}My name is Mellinda.{nl}I am going to give you a simple test if you are qualified to become a Krivi. Are you okay?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001090	Good. The test is simple.{nl}Receive this crystal jewel.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001091	This absorbs the monster's vitalities and possess them as the energy of the flame.{nl}Hunt for the monsters outside the city and put the energies into the jewel.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001092	When the jewel gets big, use the jewel to light up the torch beside me.{nl}With that, I will test to see if you would be able to use the energies of the torch well.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001093	Defeat the monsters and fill in the energies of the jewel.{nl}And when you light up the torch with the jewel, the test will be over.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001094	I think you would be able to use the energy of the torch efficiently.{nl}Welcome to the way of Krivi.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001095	You want to walk the way of the Priest.{nl}I recognized it at once. Your competence is enough to become a Priest.{nl}It's just... to pray that your journey would be alright, we need some preparations.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001096	Please receive this divine water.{nl}And you just have to receive blessing from the other priests here in Orsha.{nl}Ask for the blessing to Clerik, Krivi and Bokor sub-masters.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001097	Ask for the blessing to Cleric, Krivi and Bokor sub-masters.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001098	Good. Blessing from the four priests including me would help your journey.{nl}From now on, I want you to concentrate on the roles of Priest and responsibilities.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001099	"
You want to step into a higher level?{nl}It's going to be a tough way. Are you still going to go? To look for the strength?"
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001100	Good. If that's so I would have to check whether you are ready.{nl}Defeat Yognomes at 63_3 of Bracken Forest.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001101	If you could defeat 30 of them, I would acknowledge your strength.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001102	You are not just bluffing, but you surely possess competence.{nl}On behalf of the master, I will teach you everything about Sworsman.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001103	Did you get used to two handed swords?{nl}Now, I will teach you how you can use two handed swords well.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001104	But, I want to check how much you've grown up as a Highlander.{nl}Yognomes at 63_3 of Bracken Forest would fit you well. I will teach you the skills after that.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001106	Well done. As I promised to you, I will teach you high level skills that can be used with two handed swords.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001107	Have you become familiar with using shields in battles?{nl}Okay then I will teach you the skills of Peltasta now.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001109	But, there are restrictions.{nl}Firstly, I only admit the crystals which you've obtained while equipped with shiedls.{nl}Secondly, if you become unable to fight, the crystals you would have collected until that point will be all cancelled.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001110	Defeat the monsters and collect the crystals while equipped with a shield.{nl}This is to check your surviving skills.{nl}For your reference, it will be efficient to defeat the demons.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001111	You seem competent enough as a Peltasta.{nl}Congratulations. As I promised to you, I will teach you skills that are one level higher.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001112	It's easy to teach you how to use a spear, but your mind is important.{nl}There is a location to test applicants like you.{nl}The assignment is simple. It's just irritating.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001113	Come back after defeating 30 Yognomes from Bracken Forest 63_3.{nl}If you do so, I will acknowledge your skills.{nl}In my feelings, you would pass the test easily.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001114	If you have a trouble with Yognomes, then it wouldn't be that bad to look for another way.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001115	You want to become a Barbarian? Can you endure the training?{nl}Good. I will test you to see whether you can at least imitate some fightings.{nl}If this was our hometown, they would have passed the test. Do you want to receive it?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001116	The most important quality of Swordsman is belligerence.{nl}You should attack anyone who shows hostility to the ones that you should protect.{nl}Think of Yognomes at 63_3 of Bracken Forest as your barriers and destroy all of them.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001117	I thought you are wiry since you told me that you wanted to become a Barbarian... Are you going to give up?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001118	There are some useful people here even in this place.{nl}Good. On behalf of Walter at Klaipeda, I will teach you the skills of Barbarian.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001119	Have you heard the stories?{nl}Some of the refugees that were coming to Orsha are hurt and fell near Lamparasa Pond.{nl}We should save them!

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001122	It is so fortunate that a big problem didn't occur to them.{nl}It's all because of the devotion that you've shown to us.{nl}You look competent enough to progress to the last stage of Cleric.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001123	I think the time has come to tell your religious belief to the goddesses and receive the blessings.{nl}Pray to the goddesses near Orsha and dedicate these goods.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001124	Go to the statues of the goddesses at Lamparasa Pond, Linked Bridges, and Paupys Dock.{nl}Return after dedicating the goods to all statues.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001125

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001130	The effects of the three herbs are not that different from each other.{nl}As I told you, don't forget this also tests for your advancement.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001131	Let's see... It surely is.{nl}When your good deeds accumulate like this, you will feel that your religious belief gets deeper.{nl}You've passed the test. From now on, you will be learning higher level Priest skills.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001133	Yes! You should have made Bokor dolls in order for you to be called a Bokor.{nl}Make the doll with this manual.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001134	Long time ago, the Master also became a Bokor after making Shaman Dolls.{nl}It is the ritual which has the history and the tradition.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001135	This Shaman Doll has the highest grade among the dolls which I've seen before!{nl}You seem to possess the attributes of Bokor.{nl}Now, you are the Bokor. Welcome!

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001137	The end of the graving chisel has run out.{nl}I guess we should ask the blacksmith in Orsha.{nl}Tell him that it is my request and get the new graving chisel.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001138	I am sorry. I am counting on you until Orsha.{nl}I have matters to do here.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001139	What's the matter? Ah.. I remember that Divdirbys girl.{nl}But, what should I do. The chisel and the materials are all ran oout.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001140	I hope you can get the materials.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001142	The metals that are accumulated in the bodies of the monsters get crumpled together at 63_3 of Bracken Forest.{nl}Defeat Yognomes and collect the metal chunks.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001143	Yes. This would be enough.{nl}Crafting is not that hard so if you wait a bit, I will make it for you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001144	It is almost done.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001145	It is a decent object so you would be able to stand for some time.{nl}Give it to him.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001146	Ask him to come by Orsah sometimes.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001147	Damn... I knew that it was taking longer than expected, but I didn't know that you made such efforts.{nl}Thank you. Of course, you are a Divdirbys from now on.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001152	You would easily defeat any kinds of demons.{nl}But, in order to defeat the real bad demons, you will have to try hard.{nl}I will open the true way of Peltasta for you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001153	But, you should at least pass the minimum requirement.{nl}Come back after defeating Chapparitions from Carolis Pond.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001161	Hmm... You've become very strong.{nl}I didn't know that you've completed the training that hard. You will be able to learn the skills of the next stage.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001179	The master told me that it is already decided that who and what cards will be brought.{nl}However, with my skills, I don't know what cards you would bring.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001180	The light, the salavation, the vice and the cursed jewel..? These are the everything I can read.{nl}They are all rarely written. Especially the last word is significant.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001181	It's your duty to interpret them.{nl}But, you look like someone with the abnormal destiny unlike other people.{nl}I hope that you can fulfill all your duties.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001182	When I was parted with Tesla, he gave me an assignment.{nl}I have to carve some special sculpture, but the materials are hard to obtain.{nl}He told me to request to someone who can be relied on and I think you are the right person.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001184	He didn't ask me to save him myself, but he wants me to ask someone who can be relied on...{nl}I think he is also testing my benevolence.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001185	You brought them well. I can tell they are the materials that I asked you.{nl}As I promised, I will teach you high level skills of Divdirbys.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001190	You want to enter the way of Paladin?{nl}It is different from other priestsl. In order to become a Paladin, you have to possess strong power.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001191	Good. You are competent.{nl}Okay then, shall I test you? Come back after defeating monsters at Peretory Hills.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001192	We, Paladins stand at the front line when we fight against the demons.{nl}With the uncertain skills you have, you would soon experience something unfortunate.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001193	You've done well way better than I expected.{nl}As I promised, I will appoint you as a Paladin on behalf of the Master.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001198	I can now call you a Rodelero.{nl}However, in order to become stronger, sometimes you should know your strength as well.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001199	I think you are ready.{nl}If that's so, defeat the monsters at Apsimesti Crossroads without using a shield.{nl}In fact, face the monsters without equipping the monsters.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001200	The shields are the most reliable colleague of Rodelero.{nl}But, a Swordsman should be strong himself.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001201	I was able to check the potential again.{nl}As you know, my teaching is very strict so you should be well prepared.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001202	How about it, do you understand now what the piercing is?{nl}Okay, then let's get ready to proceed to the next level.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001205	You are going to become a good cavalry after the kingdom gets reconstructed in the future.{nl}Of course, until then, use the skills that I will teach you and do your duties at your best.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001208	The skills which you've learned will be used effectively in the battles.{nl}It wouldn't be that dangerous in Apsimesti Crossroads.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001209	Well done!{nl}Now your journey as a Bokor has really started.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001210	I barely got in contact with Tesla!{nl}I've wrote you in the letter and he surely has high expectations in you.{nl}So, how about you try out for the last level of Divdirbys?

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001214	The perfumed oil has been completed.{nl}With this perfumed oil, please repair Vakarine Statue at Orsha and Fedimian.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001215	I heard that one can easily move to Fedimian by using the power of the goddess statue.{nl}We would be able to reduce some time.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001216	I think the citizens at the two cities will have hope by just looking at the clean statues.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001217	You've come back from a long way. Tesla would compliment for sure.{nl}You would become great from now on.{nl}I guess I have a rival now.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001218	You've come at the right time.{nl}I've heard that the number of Red Triamublos has increased a lot at Apsimesti Crossroad and they are threatening the villagers.{nl}If you want to step forward as a true Sadhu, please share your abilities.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001224	I know a suitable opponent who you can fight against.{nl}Monsters called Gaigalas are going crazy at Tenent's Farm.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001225	I can see how great you are.{nl}But, in order to advance, we need more clear verification.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001226	In fact, I thought it's going to be dangerous, but I guess I misunderstood your skills.{nl}Well done. Anyone would acknowledge you as a high level Paladin.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001227	I am looking for the whereabouts of Zemina goddess.{nl}Everyone knows that the goddess has disappeared.{nl}

QUEST_UNUSED_20151022_001233	What? Are you the revelator?{nl}If that's so, have you come here after dreaming about the disaster?{nl}.. If that's so, you may be the revelator in the folkore that is passing down in our village.{nl}

QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002137	The demons and the beast monsters are still wandering around, but I am relieved a bit since at least they are not close enough to come to the village.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002138	I was attacked by the demons while picking up the herbs. Fortunately, I saved my life, but I got hut a lot.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002151	I've checked the footsteps of the demons in the village. I am sure the demons have intruded into the village. There are no corpses and the house looks normal so the demons are not planning to steal.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002152	Then, why and what for, demons took the villagers?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002153	There. The marble of Polki. As I arrived the village, I saw the marble of Polki dropped on the ground.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002162	Oh goddess! Thank you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002163	If it wasn't you, we would all have died.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002164	Demons told us that they are going to use the braken and use us as the source of the divine tree! We should just look for someone who is qualified.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002165	Demons intruded into the village and took the people away.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002166	Demons were taking the villagers and heading towards the monastery. Demons stopped while taking us for a long time and then wizards appeared.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002167	The wizard has done some unidentified ritual to the villagers.{nl}When he did the ritual to the villagers, there weren't any unique responses, but I was able to see the response when we did the ritual to your brother, Edmundas.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002168	The wizard ordered the demons to take Edmundas seperately.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002169	The wizard threatened us. We've told the wizard that Edmundas has sister who is you.{nl}And I also described your appearances.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002170	After hearing the information about you, the wizard told us that
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002171	Cruvina is already prepared and the gigantic brackens

QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002175	Your spirits will be used as sources for the divine trees.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002176	After hearing the words from the wizard, I ran away to let the lord of Orsha know it.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002177	Let's go to the monastery fast
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002178	Herb broker Ahs
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002179	While I was picking up the herbs, the demons appeared and attacked me. Fortunately, I ran away, but I am scared whether the demon would attack me again.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002180	Starting from a few months ago, the demon started to appear at Knidos Forest.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002181	Because of you, the place seems to be stabilized a bit.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002182	As I was moving around to pick up the herbs, it was my first time to see the demons picking up the grass. I am not sure whether or not the demons are plotting something. I guess I should check which grass they are picking up.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002183	Have you checked what grass did the demons extract?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002184	As I expected. {nl}The demons are actually extracting the herbs that are highly toxic.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002185	If we process this herb further, it would become a deadly poison to humans. It is so certain that the demons are extracting these herbs. I guess I should do something so that the demons would not be able to pick up the herbs. I will sprinkle the body fluid of the monsters to kill the herbs.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002186	I won't let the demons do what they want to do.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002187	This would be enough.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002188	Sprinkle the body fluid of the monsters onto the herbs
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002189	Sprinkle the body fluid of the monsters onto the place where there are herbs.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002207	I heard someone is helping the settlers and it's you!{nl}On behalf of the elder, I really appreciate you.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002209	The story that the villages across the rivers, the fields and the mountains were stepped on by the monsters spreaded quickly..{nl}I've persuaded people that the soldiers would come and help us from Orsha, but as the story that the village right beside was attacked by the monsters spreaded, I couldn't reduce people's agitation.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002210	{nl}I thought the goddesses abondoned us. I was going to move the people to Klaipeda.{nl}At then, they ordered people to move on the land where the lord survived..{nl}The damages were too severe. He should've called us sooner..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002211	It's so hard for me to do this whole day.{nl}It may rather be better to follow the monsters like the soldiers.{nl}I want to help you... but, please also think about my situation.{nl}If I let you in first, they will be angry.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002212	I will cancel my words that I would follow the monsters like the soldiers a while ago.{nl}Even when we have more than 10 lives, it would not be enough.{nl}Because of you, I was able to block the monsters from going into Orsha.{nl}It was a substitution time, so I almost fell into a danger.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002215	I am Innessa Hemandale who is controlling Orsha.{nl}Thank you for helping our citizens.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002216	We are recovering Orsha as you can see.{nl}With the soldiers we have at the moment, it is hard for us to protect Orsha.{nl}That's why we are moving all setters who have survived to Orsha even if that means we are going to have hard time for several years.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002217	The world turned wild, but neither the military nor the king protected us.{nl}You are the one who are helping the settlers right?{nl}Although, I am not competent enough, I am sure the goddesses want me to help you as well.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002224	{nl}You would probably need it.{nl}If you could defeat the monsters at the 2nd district and get me Lempar mucus,{nl}I will make you an invigorating drink with that.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002234	According to what Ryutas told us, we can't just let in lots of settlers into Orsha{nl}so we've set up various small camps around the outer wall of Orsha and supporting the settlers.{nl}The bonfires which you've lit up are to support the settlers.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002235	There was a big disturbance. You are not hurt anywhere?{nl}I am sorry that I've put you in this mess.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002236	{nl}This is so horrible. Those gigantic monsters are wandering in the forest.{nl}We have nothing that we can do to the settlers in the forest..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002237	I haven't seen you before. Are you the officer in Orsha?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002238	{nl}Ah.. damn. I've made a big mistake.{nl}I am called Ibanayu from the southern coast.{nl}I heard that there are lots of supplies and we will be protected safely here so I've ran here without sleeping while leaving the village in the south..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002239	{nl}As you can see, what's prepared for us is the bonfire and a few lumps of grass.{nl}Also we don't have enough officers who would protect us..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002240	{nl}{nl}What we can do is that we can pick up the goods which the natives had used and left and use them to obtain the food.{nl}Can you collect those from the 5th district?{nl}I heard that if we leave this place, the monsters would go crazy so people like us can't walk around.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002241	The south coast also received some damages.{nl}The fruits that came down from the river at the north destroyed all the fishing nets{nl}and due to the fruit juice that spurted out from the fruits, I've just kept seeing the sea which turned colorful.{nl}At least, the south was okay since there were no monsters there..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002242	I will use them well. Since people are still coming up from the two villages at the southern coast,{nl}I will pass the story about you well if I meet the lord.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002243	You look very different to be called as a settler..{nl}The people around Orsha do not wear clothes like that.{nl}Are you a traveller?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002244	{nl}If that's so, why don't you pray in front of the statue of Zemina Goddess at the 6th district?{nl}Zemina Goddess controls the land and she also takes care of the travel roads of the travellers.{nl}But, the goddess is not responding to our prayer from sometime.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002245	I don't know who has set up so many statues of the goddess.{nl}But, as I hear it, it's very old.{nl}So they either break up or become monsters' habitats..{nl}and there are also cases which monsters go into the statues of the goddesses.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002246	{nl}Of course, you don't have to believe it..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002247	Have you been to 7th district? The elder asked us to meet at the 7th district when we arrive at Lemprasa Pond, but we can't go due to the monsters..{nl}In order to prevent it from getting stolen from the settlers, we should go there first.{nl}But, I can't do that with my skills.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002248	{nl}If monsters appear around there, can you please defeat them?{nl}When the elder come, I will tell him about you for sure.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002249	Due to the order to move out, I abondoned my house and blamed a lot{nl}But, after I heard about the situation at the north, I stopped thinking about that.{nl}I hope the village would be safe until the order gets lifted.{nl}The elders left here since they said they can't leave the village.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002250	How can they ask us to gather at the place where monsters are going crazy.. {nl}The lord is asking us for too much.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002251	After the order to move out, we didn't move with the villagers.{nl}I think the people who have left before us would probably be at the 8th district by now.{nl}Can you bring those people back here?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002252	{nl}Even if we group together with the people of Romanas Elder,{nl}this place seems safer than the 8th district..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002253	I know that this place has been prepared for us, but I didn't expect it to be this dangerous..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002254	Thank you. I should ask Romanas before our elder comes here that{nl}if I can be here.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002255	I've heard a lot that a mysterious man is helping my people.{nl}I heard that he is a person who receives lots of respect from others.{nl}It is well known that he helped them while the kingdom and the lord didn't do anything.{nl}He is like a hero sent by the goddesses.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002256	{nl}I have a request for a hero like him.{nl}In Orsha, our residents have someone{nl}whom they rely on spiritually more than the lord.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002257	{nl}Urbonas is someone who we all need to recover Orsha which was torn in pieces.{nl}But, lately, I can't see him.{nl}He disappeared with his priests without any words.{nl}My informants are looking for the whereabouts of Urbonas.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002258	{nl}I want to request to help finding the whereabouts of Urbonas.{nl}Without anybody knowing..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002259	A big chaos would result if the residents find out about this.{nl}The order to move out came down late already and various villages were attacked by the monsters.{nl}If they find out that Urbonas disappeared, it would be hard to control Orsha.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002260	Lately, one of his disciples, Pranas came back.{nl}To listen for more details, I talked with him, but Pranas also doesn't know why.{nl}He is busy looking for whereabouts of Urbonas.{nl}My subordinates and the hired chasers are searching the Linked Bridges and Paupys Port.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002261	{nl}But, there is no more progress due to the outrageous monsters.{nl}We need your help.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002262	We must look for Urbonas.{nl}In this world, where even the goddesses do not answer, the only one we can rely on is Urbonas.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002263	Urbonas is cooperating with my family.{nl}Recently, there are reports that demons are appearing from Linked Bridges and Paupys Port.{nl}I can't tell you for sure, but I don't have a good feeling on this.{nl}For Orsha and its residents, can you look for the whereabouts of Urbonas?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002264	Thanks for helping us.{nl}Please visit the statue of the goddesses before you leave.{nl}The statues of the goddesses will be the guide that will be needed in your journeys.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002265	{nl}And although not big, I've told the item merchant so you can receive some goods from the merchant.{nl}May the luck with you on your journey.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002266	You should never tell the residents that the bishop has disappeared.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002267	I've heard from the bishop.{nl}You are telling others that you are the hero sent by the goddesses while helping the residents outside right?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002268	{nl}Please receive these goods!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002269	After the capital city has been destroyed, there are not many intact cities in this kingdom.{nl}Either Klaipeda or Fedimian..{nl}If you need any potions or tools in the future, you will meet me often.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002270	{nl}And it seems that the lord has requested something to the accessories merchant,{nl}so you better meet the accessories merchant.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002271	Travellers are coming to Orsha since it is relatively safe.{nl}The world has collapsed, but I am making more money than before..{nl}Isn't it ironic?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002272	Hello! I really wanted to meet you.{nl}I've hard that you saved my friends.{nl}I haven't prepared a lot, but since the bishop also told me, I will give you this!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002273	{nl}{nl}And it seems that the bishop is looking for you.{nl}Please hurry!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002274	Are you ready to leave? I've received a message from the informant that was searching at the Linked Bridges.{nl}It seems that he found some clues about the whereabouts of the bishop and his company.{nl}If you are ready, go meer Cherasia at the Linked Bridges.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002275	You seem to be the one who the elder was talking about.{nl}Nice to meet you. I am called Cherasia.{nl}I am looking for whereabouts of Urbonas and the priests here.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002276	I've told the residents that the informants were dispatched outside to protect the areas so I want you to also act as if you don't know anything so that the efforts of the informants do not end in vain.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002277	The search activities didn't end in vain.{nl}I am sure that you must have heard about Pranas from the elder.{nl}Pranas, the guy who had gone for trainings in the northern area and came back recently.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002278	{nl}We've found some traces of the priest, Iruma who is one of the disciples of the bishop here.{nl}And from the traces that were discovered, the memo that looked beloging to Iruma was ripped in pieces.{nl}When you look at the shape how it was ripped off, it seems that the monsters bit them.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002279	{nl}That's why I've caught the monsters and retrieving the pages of the memo..{nl}But, that's too much work for me.{nl}Can you defeat the monsters at the 1st district and get me the pages of the priest, Iruma?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002280	Pranas has left first to look for the traces of Urbonas with other officers.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002281	It has been stained due to the body fluid of the mosnters so its hard to recognize it, but{nl}As I read it, it's about being chansed by something.{nl}We better hurry up.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002282	{nl}Take this and meet Pranas at the northen region.{nl}I will look for the other traces here.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002283	I am an Informant, Moren.{nl}So you are the one who the bishop talked about.{nl}If Iruma is being chased after, that means the bishop is also being chased after right?{nl}I am looking for the place where the bishop and his company stayed.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002284	{nl}But, due to the monsters nearby, I can't investigate exactly.{nl}While I am checking the bonfire here, can you defeat the monsters that are disturbing us around here?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002285	The investigation has not been done yet.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002286	You found a sheet of paper that looks blackened by something.{nl}So this is the memo.. How come they burnt it like this?{nl}It seems that the travellers here didn't do this.{nl}Someone extinguished the bonfire and covered it with the lump of grass..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002287	{nl}What if it catches the fire..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002288	You told me that the priest, Iruma is being chased after by something right?{nl}Then, this blackened paper is to hide something from the chasers.{nl}No matter what the reason is, we need to collect these.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002289	{nl}As I am looking at the memo here, please look through the lumps of grass that have smoke on them{nl}and collect the memos that are half burnt.{nl}If you could collect them, I will analyze them for you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002290	I am sure that they didn't light them up since they were being chased after..{nl}Are they lit up to deceive someone?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002291	Good. Let's analyze them now.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002292	{nl}Folklore..{nl}Hemandale Familly..{nl}The Revelator
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002293	{nl}The Revelator? what is the revalator doing anyways?{nl}We better go meet Pranas fast.{nl}Please go to the northern area.{nl}I will continue the rest of the search here.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002294	You are looking for Pranas? Pranas has left to Paupys Port.{nl}He told me to look for the traces of the priests from the 5th district.{nl}There is some camp located there, but there are so many monsters which I can't face alone.{nl}I tried to defeat some of them, but since they all rushed into me after that, it is so hard for me to go there again.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002295	{nl}{nl}If you are okay, can you search the 5th district?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002296	If what Moren is thinking is true, that means this place is full of monsters by now.{nl}Do you believe the revelator really exists even when the goddesses disappeared?{nl}I don't think so.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002297	{nl}The informants have too many worries.{nl}Orsha is very far away from the place where demons are appearing..{nl}Don't worry.{nl}The bishop must have went somewhere since he is bored.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002298	
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002299	I've seen the flame roaring to the sky. Are you saying the demons really appeared?{nl}What's wrong with the diary of the bishop? It's too confusing.{nl}We better go back to Pranas.{nl}Go back to Paupys Port at the north!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002300	I think he's almost here by now.{nl}I've heard about it from the informant of the lord.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002301	I should have just stayed in my hometown and live by hunting.{nl}Demons!{nl}My mother would faint out if she finds out that I am chasing after demons.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002302	I am helping the informants here so they can carry out their duties.{nl}If you get a chance to go to the 1st district, I want you to defeat the monsters there,{nl}so that the activities of the officers there would not get disturbed.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002303	I was actually working here for a different mission.{nl}Recently, many problems occured including the disappearance of the priests,{nl}so my task to find out why the monsters were heading to Orsha got delayed.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002304	We want monsters not to group together.{nl}Thanks.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002305	Recently, the monsters are coming near Orsha.{nl}So to find out what happened to them,{nl}they put all the monsters into a wagon and put them at the 2nd district.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002306	{nl}But, due to another matter, the wagon was abondoned and it is spreading the bad odor.{nl}Because of that, the monsters are going even more crazy.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002307	One of the principles of the informants is that they check it with their hands and their tongues.{nl}That's why we know a lot of poison water and monsters.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002308	The monsters don't usually rush into the place where the fire started so we don't have to worry about this place.{nl}Thank you for helping me.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002309	Lots of chasers came to hometown after getting hired.{nl}I never thought Orsha would be big like this.{nl}So I've brought a funny good from my hometown.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002310	{nl}Do you want to use this monster stimulant?{nl}It seems that you are receiving requests from lots of people,{nl}so if you use this, you would be able to do some of those tasks easier.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002311	When you sprinkle this monster stimulant to the monsters, the monsters may attack my allies,{nl}but, if there are no allies around, they may attack humans.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002312	How was it? If the effects are good, I should make some of them and sell them at Orsha.{nl}I've worked as a merchant before the world turned out like this so I know what's worth of making money.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002313	The informants have left for the another task so they want me to do the investigation on their behalf.{nl}They want me to investigate the Linked Bridges Forest.{nl}I think they are trying to hide the refugees from the north around here..{nl}I guess they don't have enough force.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002314	According to what the informant told me who handed over the task to me, the most suspicious area is the 5th district.{nl}It seems that they also handed over some task to you.. if you are going to the 5th district, can you get rid of the monsters and their habitats?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002315	I am getting paid for doing this.. Why are you doing this for?{nl}Well.. if you want to just have some experiences, I guess that's not that bad after all..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002316	Damn.. the monsters set up their nests in this normal looking forest too..{nl}This is.. difficult..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002317	Pranas has left to the northern region with other informants first.{nl}I am looking for the traces of the Priest, Gelliya who was discovered here.{nl}But, its so hard for me to search here due to the attributes of the monsters since they are different from the ones in our hometown.{nl}Can you help me getting the pages of Gelliya's memo by defeating the monsters?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002318	{nl}This memo should possess some decisive evidence.{nl}The traces that are being left by the ones who run away since they want others to find them.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002319	I was not going to think too much about the safety of Orsha if I can continue to get paid.. {nl}But, after seeing the demons that are appearing here, I remember my hometown.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002320	Thanks. Because it is ripped in pieces, I can't check exactly what's written..{nl}It seems that a few disciples went missing while running away.{nl}It is written that the disciples of the bishop are feeling uneasy.{nl}More than anything, it seems that the demons were hiding various places in the forest and they were going after them.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002321	We better let Pranas know about it. Go to the 3rd district.{nl}While going there, please also stop by at the camp in the 2nd district and check whether there are other traces.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002322	If he went missing at the place where the demons are located..{nl}It is so unfortunate, but you won't see those priests again..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002323	So you are the one who the lord talked about. I am telling about you to the informants here.{nl}I was actually going to see Pranas, but I was taking a rest since Jali got too tired.{nl}It seems that Jali got too excited since there is some place here where the bishop and his company used to stay.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002324	{nl}Jali was the dog that was being raised by Urbonas.{nl}I thought I would find it quicker if I use the olfactory sense of Jali.{nl}If you are looking for the bishop's company, why don't you take Jali with you?{nl}For Pranas, he would need even slightest clues.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002325	I hope there's a dog like Jali at the informants' camp as well.{nl}It is cute, it follows people's orders well and most of all, it searches really well.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002326	Did Jali find something?{nl}It is certain that there were lots of people around here.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002327	I am worried because I heard some screaming sound from the north side of the trails.{nl}Can you first go to the 8th district?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002328	If I find Pranas, I would have to go back to Orsha and be prepared.{nl}Informants usually spend the time by wandering around..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002329	What are you doing here, Run Away!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002330	What? You've come here to look for Pranas?{nl}Then, we are too late. Pranas was attacked by the demons at the 5th district.{nl}I should've brought the informants.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002331	{nl}When I met his eyes, all we can do was to run away.{nl}Pranas will be in danger if it continues like this!{nl}Help us!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002332	There's nothing we can do.{nl}If Pranas gets attacked, the bishop's disappearance will go into mystery forever..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002333	Damn..{nl}Who are you? You've saved me.{nl}One or two demons were wandering around so I was going to search the camp, but{nl}the boss suddenly appeared..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002334	So the elder sent you?{nl}Then you must know that the bishop has already disappeared..{nl}I can't even control myself so it's hard for me to continue the search activities.{nl}Can you look around here on behalf of me?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002335	{nl}If this place doesn't exist, we may have to go to the forest in the north that turned into a ruin.{nl}I am worried since there are more dangerous monsters out there..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002336	If you find something, please come look for me at Orsha.{nl}I am counting on you..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002337	I took some rest and as a result, I got better.{nl}Have you found something?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002338	With the informants, I am helping the chasers who were hired to search Paupys Port and do the investigation.{nl}But, it's too hard for me to do it alone.{nl}If you get a chance to cross the 1st district, please tell me after defeating the monsters there.{nl}Then, I will pass your good intentions to the elder.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002339	I was called here during my vacation so I don't know what's going on.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002340	You've defeated that many?{nl}Are the ones from the outside all strong like you?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002341	I haven't found out exactly why the demons are wandering around here, but..{nl}there are many magic fields wihch the demons have set up at the 2nd district.{nl}If you get a chance to visit the 2nd district, can you get rid of those?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002342	When I came here last time due to the problem of the settlers.. there were nothing like this..{nl}What's going on?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002343	I don't understand why they set this up.{nl}It doesn't seem to have any damages.. It is stragne.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002344	The villagers in the north would start to emigrate soon.{nl}The lord is thinking about making them stay near the 4th district.{nl}The villagers in the north are aggressive and there are elders who were once mercenaries so if there is a camp for them{nl}they think they can protect themselves.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002345	{nl}So they told me to check whether those monsters are the ones we can handle ourselves{nl}I am a person who actually write documents and putting stamps on the documents instead of doing investigations so this is too much task for me.{nl}I heard that you are very strong. Can you check 4/5 districts?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002346	I never held a sword except for when I joind the squad so I don't understand why they are sending us to this kind of place..{nl}The lord is asking too much.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002347	Are you saying that a gigantic monster appeared at the camp?{nl}I haven't seen with my own eyes, but I can't tell others to stay theree.{nl}You agree right? I will count on you and report.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002348	We are facing a difficult situation.{nl}The demons which I saw in the books may appear at the place where I was dispatched..{nl}This is too much for me.{nl}And due to the demons that I haven't seen, the monsters may have gone violent..{nl}How can they ask me to extract the blood from the monsters...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002349	If you get a chance to visit 5th district, could you defeat the monsters there and collect their blood?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002350	I am not a coward.{nl}I just know my place.{nl}I don't fight with a sword or a spear, but rather with pens and stamps..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002351	What is this disgusting odor?{nl}I don't know why he ordered me to collect these.{nl}He knows well..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002352	It's too hard for me to survive by just hunting these days so I came down this far.{nl}We should live on.{nl}In this place, we won't survive even if we have more than 10 lives.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002353	{nl}We were injured and we don't know when the monsters and the demons would go after us.{nl}While we are recovering, can you defeat the monsters around?{nl}Since we don't have any one who is okay, I have no one to request other than you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002354	I want to swear to the ones who took me here.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002355	I think I have some problem on my legs or ankles.{nl}If you didn't help me, I am sure that I would have been attacked.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002356	Have you seen any bags or luggages around here?{nl}While we were away, the monsters took the goods of the chasers and the informants{nl}and ran away.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002357	{nl}If you get a chance to go to 8th district, can you look for our luggages?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002358	I am hurt and lost my luggages..{nl}Before you asked me to help me, I didn't have any excuses so I didn't know what to do.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002359	Thank you so much! Althugh I haven't retrived them all, I think I now have something to say!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002360	I can now barely manage ourselves.{nl}This is all because of your help.{nl}Although I am not good, I translated the diary of the bishop so do you want to listen to it?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002361	When I translate the diary of the bishop, I can read something like this.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002362	{nl}{nl}If the world goes into a chaos, an outsider who was assigned by the goddesses would visit Orsha.{nl}But, that outsider would come in with other outsiders.{nl}It is our destiny to find and guide him.{nl}Among many outsiders, we should look for the one who we are looking for.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002363	{nl}Before we are even ready, the demons are chasing after the right.{nl}I am heading to the Ashaq Underground Prison with my priests.{nl}There, I will wait for the revelator.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002364	{nl}{nl}We didn't have enough time to pass it to Inessa and the priests who went outside.{nl}If someone discovers this diary, please hand it over to Inessa Hemandale.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002365	{nl}{nl}I understand now.{nl}Being chased after the demons! That's a big problem.{nl}We better let the lord know this!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002366	Urbonas was being chased after the demons!{nl}Ashaq Underground Prison was closed for a long time.{nl}I don't know what they are trying to do..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002367	{nl}Someone must go there now!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002368	I will get ready to go to Ashaq underground prison.{nl}I want you to tell this to the lord fast!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002369	It would take long time to send my subordinates there.{nl}I am sorry, but can you go to Ashaq Underground Prison where Pranas and Urbonas are located?{nl}I can't move so I feel stuffy..
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002370	If you are the revelator which Urbonas talked about, we better go meet Urbonas fast.{nl}However, even if you are busy, you should be well prepared so go meet the item merchant.{nl}I've prepared goods which you would be able to use well.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002371	{nl}If your preparation gets completed, don't come to me, but please rather meet Pranas and head to Ashak Underground Prison!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002372	I've prepared it fast since the lord sent the people.{nl}I should give you a better good, but since we are in a hurry, please use it.{nl}When you use an anvil, you would be able to enhance your weapon.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002373	If the demons hurt Urbonas, then the next target will be Orsha.{nl}We should do our best to save Urbonas!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002374	Your words are correct.{nl}The northern region where I used to stay became a ruin due to the demons.{nl}Probably, the next location will be the southern region.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002375	{nl}Orsha is the base of the southern part of the kingdom.{nl}I am sure that the demons would do something.{nl}Please go to Ashak Underground Prison with me to save Urbonas!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002376	I am gonna go to ask for help to the chasers.{nl}If you are ready, please come to xx region that leads to Ashak Underground Prison at Paupys Port.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002377	They are all experienced chasers who would help me.{nl}But, it's not going to enough do it just by us.{nl}It is so fortunate that you came with us.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002378	I can feel some ominous energy coming from the direction of the Underground Prison.{nl}If you are ready, let's head to Ashaq Underground Prison.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002379	I will first leave with the chasers.{nl}Please follow us right away.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002380	It feels like something unknown is suffocating me.{nl}I can't even breathe.{nl}By the way, are you okay?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002381	{nl}By seeing that you are free inside, I guess the goddesses really take care of you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002382	I've been to this place a few times when I was doing training in the past.{nl}But, I never felt like something is suffocating me.{nl}Same with that ominous fog.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002383	{nl}Since you seem safe, can you go to the 2nd district and{nl}check what's going on?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002384	This feeling is like a curse.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002385	I've never seen an icon with a shape like that.{nl}I think the demons have some other objective.{nl}I can't do anything at the moment so I am very grateful{nl}that you've destroyed the icon for me.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002386	{nl}There is a possibility that the bishop and his brothers are hiding in the hidden room.{nl}Since we can't do anything, you should go there alone.{nl}Are you going to be okay?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002387	If possible, I want you to eliminate all the icons.{nl}If they remain, we can't run away even if our brothers are alive.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002388	This place is old and mazed so if we go into a wrong way, we may not be able to go up.{nl}Please be careful.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002389	So you've come here with Pranas?{nl}You've entered into a deadly place in order to save me.. I am too sorry to see my dead disciples.{nl}Recently, when my disciple, Iruma was doing training, he found a sheet of order.{nl}It contained the plans of the demons to annihilate Orsha.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002390	{nl}I gathered my disciples and met with Irma to try and analyze the document.{nl}But since then we've been constantly under attack by the demons.{nl}The document says that Demon Goddess Giltine is trying to kill all Revelators. {nl}So our order came here to hide and prepare to meet and guide the destined Revelator.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002391	{nl}{nl}We had no way of telling Lord Inesa, however.{nl}If we left any traces the demons would find us and we thought that would be the end of us.{nl}My disciples and I ended up hiding here, trying to avoid the demons.{nl}But there was something we missed.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002392	{nl}We were being chased by no ordinary demon, but a Demon Lord.{nl}This Demon Lord, Marnox, set up statues of himself to control the prison{nl} and had his vassals close in on us to keep us from escaping.{nl}We thought soon it would be over for us.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002393	{nl}The priests are hiding in levels 2F and 3F.{nl}A few priests went missing, and Irma and I met Marnox trying to escape from the hidden room where we hid the demon warrant.{nl}Irma was caught by Marnox, while I managed to escape and was ready to die by now.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002394	{nl}But if Inesa sent you here, there is still hope.{nl}There is no doubt you are the Revelator we have been waiting for.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002395	If you are a Revelator, step onto our magic circle.{nl}If your status is confirmed, then you can face the Demon Lord.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002396	Don't be afraid.{nl}The goddesses will lead your way.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002397	The efforts of our order were not in vain.{nl}Revelator...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002398	{nl}Only you can face Demon Lord Marnox now.{nl}Please, save our priests and the people of Orsha.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002399	Revelator, thanks to you destroying the statues Pranas is now able to move.{nl}I'm old and will be nothing but a burden to you; go with Pranas and Irma and save the priests.{nl}Please.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002400	I can't escape on my own and leave the priests behind.{nl}We need to find the demon warrant. {nl}We need to analyze it and figure out the demons' invasion plans.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002401	The bishop is alive!{nl}I'm so glad to hear that.{nl}And you really are a Revelator.{nl}The goddesses are on our side.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002402	There's a sinister energy hanging over this place.{nl}Still, I want to be useful to our employer...{nl}I know you must be busy, but if you're headed to region 1, will you{nl}defeat some demons there and get something for me?{nl}Something safe.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002403	You seem to be in better condition than us.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002404	I don't know what they'll do with this but at least it won't look like I'm slacking off on the job.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002405	All the agents outside asked me to get something for them.{nl}Honestly I have no interest in these things...{nl}But since they asked I guess I'll have to do it.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002406	{nl}I'm going to look for what I can; if you happen to face some demons in region 2{nl}will you get something from them, too?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002407	Isn't it better to capture the demons instead, though?{nl}That is, assuming you can catch them, of course.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002408	A wooden piece.{nl}Is it an amulet? I wonder what they can do with this...{nl}Well, it's better than nothing.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002409	I hear from the agents that the demons have a kind of sack they carry around with them.{nl}I wonder if these sacks don't have something to do with how they can live in these terrible conditions.{nl}If you go to region 3, get some after you defeat the demons and try and use the sacks.{nl}Who knows, they could be useful for yourself, too.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002410	I came to help with the maintenance work but look at what almost happened.{nl}You really can't trust anyone outside the church.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002411	This could be very useful.{nl}I ought to show it to the agents as soon as I get outside.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002412	So the brothers are all hiding in the level below.{nl}Let's go, then.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002413	If Draznie and Auranas are safe, that means the other brothers can still be alive.{nl}But it's the same thing here.{nl}There's cursed statues everywhere.{nl}We really need to get rid of them as soon as we can...{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002414	According to Draznie, there's a cursed totem in region 2.{nl}Will you take it down?{nl}It will be easier to look for Irma in region 3 after that.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002415	The bishop is very fond of Irma.{nl}She needs to be alive...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002416	You destroyed the statue?{nl}It's such a relief to hear that.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002417	Now please look for traces of Irma in region 3.{nl}Let us hope she's still alive...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002418	Revelator, you are the only one our order can depend on.{nl}The same goes for the Lord and the residents of Orsha.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002419	What happened...?{nl}I thought the Demon Lord had killed me...{nl}Where are we?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002420	So the statues were the reason why we couldn't move.{nl}I saw them in regions 4 and 5 when the bishop and I were trying to avoid the Demon Lord.{nl}The ones I saw looked a little different, but it seems like Marnox set them up to spy on us.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002421	{nl}Will you take down the statues in regions 4 and 5?{nl}If we don't, no matter where we go we will never escape from Marnox's grip...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002422	Before I was caught by the Demon Lord, the bishop told me all about the fate of our order.{nl}Revelator, I am truly glad to have met you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002423	Irma went down to the third floor.{nl}She told me to send you there when you came back.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002424	{nl}I don't think I can move from here.{nl}I'm afraid you'll have to go on your own.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002425	Irma said she was going to the third floor to find Gelija.{nl}She's Irma's sister so I couldn't even try to stop her.{nl}She knows we can't do anything without you here,{nl}I don't know why she's acting like this.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002426	{nl}Find Irma before the Demon Lord finds her again.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002427	Irma told me.{nl}That you came all the way here from Orsha to find us.{nl}I'm not afraid now that I know a Revelator is with us.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002428	Irma is too reckless and that's a problem.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002429	The bishop was very worried.{nl}There were of course many places to meet with a Revelator other than here.{nl}Draznie and I were in charge of this prison so we made a lot of preparations for a future crisis here.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002430	{nl}Originally we simply planned to avoid any difficult enemies, but since you're here{nl}we should make use of our hidden tools.{nl}I left some bags of pearl powder in region 1.{nl}If you collect this powder we can use it against the demons.{nl}I'll tell you how after you bring back the powder.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002431	Once again I'm in awe with our bishop's sense of foresight.{nl}If he hadn't prepared this we would have been left at the hands of the demons.{nl}I hope the missing brothers are at the other hideouts we prepared.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002432	This is more than enough.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002433	The demons aren't simple monsters; they seem to have a command hierarchy.{nl}The stronger ones commanding the weaker ones.{nl}I wonder if defeating the strong ones won't make it easier to take down the rest.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002434	{nl}Take this pearl powder and use it whenever you see a demon.{nl}The light coming from the power will point to the strongest demon monsters so you can tell who they are.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002435	We still don't know if someone's leading the demons{nl}but if we take them down one by one won't the world become safe again?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002436	Thank you.{nl}Did you deal well with the demons?{nl}There are many other things prepared but this is all I have...{nl}Draznie will have to take care of the rest.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002437	Auranas and I found several safe spots around this prison.{nl}Of course the one where we are now is not one of them.{nl}I was hiding in region 3 but the Demon Lord came with his vassals to look around the area.{nl}I had to leave all my things behind and escape.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002438	{nl}We should find that spot again if we're going to stay here a little longer...{nl}But as you can see all we can do is run.{nl}If that's fine with you, will you clear out region 3?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002439	I guess the demons didn't expect us to be hiding there...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002440	{nl}The problem is we didn't expect them to go all the way there either.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002441	Thank you.{nl}I should have a look around and hide in region 3 again.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002442	In region 4 there are several small rooms.{nl}I made traps in them with the technique I learned while working in the northern region. {nl}The have an image of me to lure the enemy.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002443	{nl}But I can't go all the way there.{nl}If it's fine with you, will you go there and activate the traps?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002444	I have several other traps and hideouts outside this prison.{nl}I prepared enough for everyone in case something happens to Orsha.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002445	Did it work well on the demons?{nl}I had never used it on demons before, so I was worried.{nl}But I'm glad to hear it went well.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002446	Go see Irma now.{nl}She's preparing to take back the demon warrant.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002447	I'm sorry for disappearing without notice.{nl}It was urgent. While you were destroying the surveillance statue{nl}I managed to escape without Marnox noticing.{nl}But it seems he has more statues here, too.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002448	Many brothers were sacrificed to reach where we are.{nl}Because this is the only path we can take.{nl}Please, stop the demons.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002449	To enter the hidden room and get the warrant, you'll have to destroy the statue in region 2. {nl}But remember not to use a transport device in its range or Marnox will catch you.{nl}Can you do it?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002450	This is strange, he should be here any minute now...{nl}Are you afraid?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002451	This is very strange.{nl}Why isn't Marnox here?{nl}From his behaviour so far, I would assume he'd come...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002452	If Marnox doesn't come, there's nothing we can do.{nl}Just in case, I think it would be good to destroy the statue in region 3 to provoke him.{nl}As long as he lives we will never be able to open the door to the hidden room.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002453	The bishop can't have been found, can he? {nl}I remember he acted so brazen when he had me caught, nothing like now.{nl}I remember how lowly he regarded priests like me...{nl}Revelator, are you afraid?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002454	He might have sent his vassals and escaped, he could be making other plans.{nl}We can't waste any more time, let's open the door.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002455	I'll open the door and you'll enter the room. {nl}Let's get the warrant and go back to the bishop immediately.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002456	You defeated Marnox...{nl}I don't think I will be able to move for a while.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002457	It was an honor defending the fate of our order until the end.{nl}It was all thanks to you.{nl}I'm going to hide here and recover, you take the warrant and go see the bishop.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002458	Do you mean you defeated Marnox?{nl}A Demon Lord... You truly have the power of a Revelator.{nl}I'm glad the priests are safe...{nl}I will talk to Inesa and make sure those who are missing return to their homes.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002459	People will remember you when Orsha prospers once again...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002460	I'm going to return to Orsha and work on the demon warrant analysis.{nl}You go see the Lord and tell her about Marnox and us.{nl}My disciples are staying here to make sure there's no traces of Marnox left and to find the missing priests.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002461	So the demons reached the areas surrounding Orsha.{nl}We were always wary of demon invasions, but we never thought we'd have to face a Demon Lord.{nl}If only I could praise your feat to the people...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002462	{nl}I'm sorry. If I told everyone about it, it would only scare the residents.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002463	I heard about what happened.{nl}Urbonas confirmed you are a Revelator sent by the goddesses.{nl}It is an honor to meet the hero of the legend passed down in our family.{nl}It seems the goddesses haven't left us yet.{nl}What are your plans now?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002464	{nl}For now, you should go see Urbonas.{nl}He's looking for you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002465	Please think of Orsha as your second home.{nl}I and the residents of Orsha are always glad to welcome you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002466	Welcome. We were just finishing the analysis. {nl}There's a few parts here and there we can't agree on, but here's what we have.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002467	{nl}{nl}(Demon warrant analysis)
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002468	We mustn't assume all the missing brothers are dead.{nl}But to find them we need to destroy Marnox's statues.{nl}Would you take care of that?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002469	Someone has to be alive...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002470	Thank you.{nl}I'll go find them as soon as I recover from my injuries.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002471	There's no way to know where the brothers are hiding in this prison...{nl}And there'll be priests that won't be able to return to their families even after all of this is over...{nl}I wish I could bring them their belongings at least.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002472	{nl}Several priests went missing in region 2.{nl}Will you look for their bags there?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002473	Not all of the bags will belong to missing people.{nl}I lost mine too, after all...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002474	Thank you. You found my bag that was lost, too.{nl}Seeing the diaries inside the bags makes me think many of the brothers are still alive. {nl}We need to find them before it's too late.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002475	There's a reason you cover your hands when you throw away something dirty.{nl}Priest Irma destroyed Marnox's cursed statues when she was running away from him.{nl}But now their remains are spread aroun all overd.{nl}Their energy could still come back and hurt us.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002476	{nl}Here's a cloth soaked in holy water. Use it to get rid of what remains of the statue.{nl}Cover the fragments with the cloth and the power of the holy water will make them disappear.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002477	Rushing anything is bound to end in trouble eventually.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002478	That's one less thing to worry about. {nl}Although, with how the demons left this place, it's going be a while before it can be back to normal.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002479	Would you go to the Uzali Crossroads and hunt some Green Lepusbunny Assassins?{nl}We could use their warm fur.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002480	Around here there are Blue Siaulav Mages that carry emergency food.{nl}Horace probably told you their food is surprisingly edible. Could you get some for me?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002481	It's funny, if it weren't for them I would have starved by now.{nl}Because of the cold, the only thing that grows around here are potatoes.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002482	First we need to do something about the heat.{nl}Horace once said that Blue Lapasape mushrooms generate heat; I want to test them.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002483	Let's see if you're skilled, then.{nl}Go to Paupys Crossing and take down ten Lapflammers and ten Lapemans.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002484	You seem strong enough already.{nl}I just need to check how well you're able to use that strength of yours.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002485	Good. You have fulfilled the most basic condition.{nl}Us Peltasta are a class that uses the shield actively against our opponents. {nl)As such, you're required to have a basic understanding of it.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002486	I'm going to ask you for some materials for your shield.{nl}First you can go to Paupys Crossing and collect metal decorations from Lafemuns.{nl}Also, gather some dry wood from an isolated worshop there.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002487	You did well.{nl}Now gather all the materials you need and craft your own shield.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002488	I'm simply following the Master's important orders.{nl}That doesn't mean I'm jealous of you for being a traveller!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002489	Of course, first you'll have to prove you can handle advanced techniques.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002490	Take this and defeat the monsters in Bracken Forest 63_3.{nl}You'll see the numbers here go up the more enemies you defeat.{nl}Demons are worth twice the points.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002491	There are a few conditions, though.{nl}One, you must defeat the enemy with a shield equipped. {nl}Two, if you become incapable of combat, the enemies you defeated until then will not count.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002492	{nl}Finally, you have to defeat the monsters without any help from your allies.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002493	Defeat monsters with your shield equipped. {nl}This will prove your survival skills.{nl}Note that catching demons will be more effective.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002494	Teaching you how to use the spear is easy, what’s important is your attitude.{nl}There's a place that's just right for learners like you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002495	The most important virtue of a warrior is their sense of combat.{nl}That means attacking anything that's hostile to what you're trying to protect.{nl}Give it a try; defeat the Yognomes in Bracken Forest 63_3.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002496	Did you hear?{nl}Some of the refugees that were coming to Orsha got hurt around the Lemprasa Pond and were left behind.{nl}They need to be rescued!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002497	I'm glad nothing worse happened to them.{nl}It was all thanks to your help.{nl}I think it's clear you're ready to move on to the final level of Cleric.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002498	The first herbs you will find in the XXX region under piles of leaves.{nl}The second herbs grow in the YY region.{nl}The third are blooming yellow flowers in region ZZ; they should be the easiest to find.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002499	The Master herself, too, got in after making her own Bokor doll.{nl}I guess you can say it's part of our history and tradition.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002500	I would say this is a very high quality Bokor doll!{nl}It really seems like you're a natural. {nl}Now you too are a Bokor. Welcome!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002501	What is it?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002502	Oh... if you mean a strong-willed Dievdirbys, yes, I know her.{nl}But I'm afraid I'm at a loss here. I have no chisel or any materials to make one.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002503	All right. Then prove you're ready to learn some advanced techniques.{nl}Show me how much you've mastered the basics.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002504	Any monster is fine, as long as you use your Highlander techniques to defeat them.{nl}Do this without the help of your colleagues.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002505	Looks like you have no problems in defeating demons.{nl}But you still need some practice for the more vicious ones.{nl}I can show you the way of a true Peltasta.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002506	If you meet the requirements, that is.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002507	I once was asked to get rid of the Chapparition in Karolis Springs.{nl}I couldn't finish the job at the time but now I think it could be a good test for you.{nl}Go to Karolis Springs and defeat the Chapparition there.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002508	I'm surprised by how much you improved.{nl}I can tell you're different from other Hoplites. {nl}You'll have no problems in becoming even stronger. So, are you ready for the next stage?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002509	Yes, that's the end of the spear I used to attack it back then.{nl}Now we can finally say it was us the Hoplites who defeated the beast.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002510	And of course, don't ask your friends to help you with this.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002511	I like your guts.{nl}Do me a favor and defeat the demons in Feretory Hills.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002512	After Medzio Diena, Feretory Hills has been crawling with demons.{nl}Go and defeat the demons there.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002513	Take this gem and go to Feretory Hills.{nl}After you injure the monsters, use the power of the gem to purify them.{nl}Then, bring back their ashes.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002514	This effectively proves your skills. {nl}Congratulations on reaching the last level of Krivis.{nl}I hope you will keep using your power to help those in need.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002515	Go to Braken Monastery 64_2 and you will see Sparnasman monsters.{nl}Defeat them in the XXX region and bring me their horns.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002516	I'm going to give you my energy.{nl}Use the energy at Feretory Hills and it will blend in with part of the monsters' spirits.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002517	Defeat the monsters with my energy imparted to collect their spirits, then bring them to me. {nl}Do this without the help of anyone.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002518	You seem ready.{nl}If so, go to the Apsimesti Crossroads without your shield and defeat the monsters there.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002519	You know you need to do this on your own, right?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002520	Are you any good with the spear now?{nl}If so, ger ready to become a true Cataphract.{nl}How's you companion's condition?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002521	Good. Imagine your arms are the spear that'll strike your opponents.{nl}And your legs are the companion that moves you around.{nl}Go to the Apsimesti Crossroads and defeat your enemies while mounted on your companion.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002522	I received a letter from Tesla!{nl}From what he wrote he seems to expect great things from you.{nl}Let's see if you've improved enough to live up to his expectations.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002523	The cities may be far from each other but there's always a fast way.{nl}Good luck.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002524	Thake this relic and go to Starving Demon's Way.{nl}Activate it at the Abandoned Altar in Hyth Cliff and the monsters will appear.{nl}I assume you know what to do next?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002525	The Abandoned Altar is by Hith Cliff in Starving Demon's Way.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002526	Good job. You're one step closer to the next level.{nl}I would be glad to introduce your talent to my uncle; he's busy working as a Master.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002527	At last, you're a true Rodelero now.{nl}But do you have what it takes to be a leader?{nl}Why don't you give it a try on the Colimencias at the Greene Manor?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002528	You're going to feel overwhelmed.{nl}But you need to know your weaknesses before you can reach the next Rodelero level.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002529	What was it like fighting such a strong opponent? Do you feel fit for a Rodelero?{nl}You're already a true Rodelero if you ask me.{nl}Keep up the good work.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002530	To become the best Cataphract you need a worthy opponent.{nl}The Gaigalas in Tenants' Farm and known for being the fiercest and most savage.{nl}Go there and defeat some.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002531	What you did was very impressive.{nl}As a Sadhu Master I look forward to your progress.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002532	You've improved quite a bit.{nl}It's time for you to be tested for the final stage.{nl}We need a way to prove your skills.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002533	And I think I know just the one.{nl}They say the Gaigalas in Tenants' Farm are some of the most unruly.{nl}Go there and defeat some to make sure they don't harm anyone else.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002534	I wondered if it wasn't too dangerous, but it seems I underestimated you.{nl}You're very impressive.{nl}I don't think anyone would doubt you're fit to become a high-level Paladin.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002535	Stop.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002536	Start!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002537	Start?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002538	Stop?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002539	I thought we might find Goddess Zemyna here but all I see are the dead...{nl}I've never seen anything like this. We need to find Zemyna.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002540	So we can't get near the relic...{nl}I understand keeping monsters and demons away, but why it's protected against people I don't know.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002541	What was that?{nl}It's so good to be safe again. I nearly returned to the goddess.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002542	I should've known... it wasn't a relic of the goddess at all.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002543	I'm going to give you my records.{nl}Take them and destroy them; only then can I finally be at peace.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002544	I don't think... I've seen you before.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002545	Hm... That's good.{nl}If you can, will you please help me?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002546	I came running after the ferrets who stole our food and ended up here.{nl}But the ferrets attacked me and I couldn't get the food.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002547	I need some first aid for my wounds...{nl}There's an herb at the Luvda Cliff that helps stop bleeding. Will you get some for me?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002548	The ferrets might attack again.{nl}These days it's like they think everything in the forest belongs to them.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002549	Thank you so much for this favor.{nl}I'm going to get some rest and then go back to the workshop where the other people are.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002550	You say you saw a girl being chased by a demon with an ax?{nl}The demon is probably Zaura; the girl I don't know.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002551	And he wants to stop the girl from meeting the Revelator...?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002552	That sounds suspicious.{nl}I need to tell the village about this.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002553	What?{nl}You're a Revelator?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002554	Did you come here after dreaming about a calamity?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002555	I wonder if...?{nl}I think you might just be the Revelator told in the story of our village.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002556	The story says... that when chaos takes over our village, a Revelator will dream of a calamity and come.{nl}They and their divine light will chase away evil and save the village.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002557	Those are the words of Goddess Laima that have been passed down.{nl}But... um...{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002558	This isn't the right time.{nl}First I'm going to ask our village chief about this story.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002559	Meanwhile, please take back our food from the ferrets who stole it.{nl}You can bring it to our village chief at the Bellai Forest Workshop.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002560	Our people don't really trust outsiders but...{nl}We can't turn our back on help.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002561	Are you the Revelator Leja talked about?{nl}And that is... our stolen food.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002562	Thank you for taking back our food but...{nl}I don't think I can't trust you just yet.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002563	Please understand.{nl}We were tricked by the demons once before, you see.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002564	Leja said she had somewhere else to be and left.{nl}I can't tell you where she is going, though.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002565	Like I said, we can't trust you just yet.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002566	We once had someone come to our village, calling himself a Revelator.{nl}It was a man with a pale face and long hair.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002567	We thought our Revelator had finally arrived and did as the man said.{nl}Truth is, in reality... he was a demon.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002568	We believed the demon and because of that Goddess Lada was taken away...{nl}Even the ferrets turned violent.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002569	We think it was because of the totem the demon made us set up.{nl}We all want to join forces and rescue Goddess Lada, but we're worried about the ferret attacks.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002570	We can't even go near the totem because of its evil energy.{nl}But if you really are a Revelator, I'm sure you can use your divine power to destroy the totem.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002571	Show us.{nl}If you really are a Revelator...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002572	Please understand.{nl}I know Leja is glad the Revelator is finnaly here but...{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002573	We've been fooled before, we can't help but be suspicious.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002574	You... you're a true Revelator, there's no doubt about it.{nl}I feel so sorry for how I treated you earlier... Please forgive this old man.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002575	Leja went to Zeraha to try and find something to help you.{nl}She said Goddess Laima will have left something prepared for the Revelator.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002576	There is a big statue of Goddess Laima there. {nl}It was sculpted a long time ago when She was still at our village.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002577	Oh, by the way... the girl came.{nl}Can I tell you about what happened in our village?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002578	Our village has always worshiped Goddess Laima.{nl}One day, She had a vision of a calamity that would strike the kingdom in a future far away.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002579	So, to stop this calamity, She decided to leave the village.{nl}Maybe She was worried about leaving us behind, so she had Goddess Lada look after us instead.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002580	But unlike what Goddess Laima predicted, our village remained peaceful.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002581	Then, unexpectedly, Medzio Diena happened.{nl}It was the calamity in Goddess Laima's vision.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002582	We weren't too affected by Medzio Diena, but that wasn't the end of it.{nl}Not long after, the river turned red.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002583	The river water caused terrible pain to everyone who drank it, and it made the fruit grow to an abnormal size.{nl}The fruit, just like the red water, was inedible.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002584	As if that weren't enough, the demons then came and took Goddess Lada.{nl}Just as Laima predicted... chaos took over the village.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002585	Leja probably told you... what Goddess Laima said to us.{nl}She said a Revelator would dream of the calamity and come with the light to chase away evil.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002586	We aren't sure what She meant by the light, but...{nl}Our elders used to say that a warm energy filled the village when Goddess Laima was here.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002587	It was all very quick.{nl}The moment that girl came to me, I felt the same warm energy our elders talked about.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002588	The girl looked me straight in the eyes and, without a word, she nodded.{nl}Then she disappeared towards Zeraha.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002589	Go, chase after the light.{nl}It can only have been sent here by Laima to guide you.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002590	Please, for Goddess Lada... and our village.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002591	That warm energy...{nl}Until the day I return to the goddess I will never be able to forget it.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002592	Go now.{nl}Follow the light and you will see the girl once again.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002593	Revelator, you didn't drink the red water, did you?{nl}I mean... If you had you probably wouldn't be here talking to me.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002594	Just don't drink the red water no matter how thirsty you are.{nl}The pain will kill you.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002595	The water is so toxic we can't even eat our fruit.{nl}It's not even the taste. When they first started to grow we were so glad but...{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002596	But then, one day I got lost around the Menacing Lowlands and I was really thirsty. {nl}Then I noticed some fruit juice that belonged to the ferrets.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002597	I figured whether I died of thirst or at the hands of the ferrets I was doomed either way.{nl}So I drank the ferrets' juice and... I don't know, nothing happened.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002598	I don't know what they did but it looked like a good substitute for water.{nl}The water in the wells is starting to turn red too, you see.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002599	Would you get some of the ferrets' fruit juice?{nl}Please. We can't live with no water.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002600	I drank it expecting to die but surprisingly I didn't.{nl}It even tasted good.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002601	Wow, thank you.{nl}With this much juice I won't have to worry for quite some time.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002602	But, um...{nl}Sigh, those dogged ferrets...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002603	While you were getting the juice, the ferrets came and stole our food again.{nl}We get it back, they steal it... I'm fed up with this!{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002604	This has to stop.{nl}This time we need to put an end to the ferrets' bad habits.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002605	We need to find the food and give it some red water "seasoning".{nl}They're all going to be rolling on the floor in pain after they eat it.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002606	The water in the old well south from here is particularly red.{nl}Maybe you can spray the food with the water from there.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002607	Oh, make sure you spray it on the meat jerky hidden in the Banaga Forest Trail.{nl}Ferrets love meat jerky.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002608	We can't let them get away with this.{nl}We've put up with it long enough.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002609	It's darker than the grass around it and has wider leaves.{nl}If you go to Luvda Cliff you'll recognize it right away.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002610	I sure hope the ferrets won't come to steal our food againafter this.{nl}It's a bit of a waste but... I hope they'll just eat it and leave us alone.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002611	Are you the Revelator who destroyed the totem?{nl}I wanted to thank you. It made me feel terrible every time I looked at it...{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002612	Anyway, I went to check in on the ferrets and they're still vicious.{nl}It looks like the effects of the totem haven't faded yet.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002613	Widas, a man from our village, said he was planning to do something...{nl}He is a talented Dievdirbys after all.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002614	Will you ask Widas if the statue is finished?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002615	The totem is at the Banaga Forest Trail.{nl}If you really are a Revelator here with the light to save our village, getting the ferrets back to normal should be within your power.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002616	If you can prove that you are a Revelator, I will tell you about Leja.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002617	Oh, that? I'm so sorry about that.{nl}It's not the first time it happened, now it seems they're finding other people to bother.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002618	Just a moment.{nl}I'll give it to you right away.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002619	When I was little the ferrets would help us get back to the village whenever we got lost.{nl}But now we've been fooled by the demons... It's a shame.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002620	I made something based on the totem I built for that filthy demon.{nl}I made it so that it radiates good instead of evil energy.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002621	It's still only a testing phase, but it'll be worth something.{nl}Place this near the ferrets and watch their reaction.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002622	This is all our fault.{nl}We should have been more suspicious, but the name of Revelator got us hopeful.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002623	I wish this statue could bring peace between us and the ferrets.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002624	The ferrets are more violent?{nl}So I failed...?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002625	I'm so sorry. Are you sure you're not hurt?{nl}Ah... But I'm not going to quit.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002626	They're probably still brainwashed by the demons.{nl}We should ask Benes when he comes back from studying the ferrets in Zeraha.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002627	Revelator, you're late!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002628	Oh... I didn't know.{nl}I'm so sorry. I've talked to our village chief about it countless times but...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002629	What?{nl}You mean the girl could have been sent by Goddess Laima?{nl}I saw her running away from the ferrets to the Broken Bridge!{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002630	I wanted to chase after them but...{nl}The ferrets were so many, there was nothing I could do.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002631	We have no time to waste.{nl}We can still find the girl if we go after the ferrets now!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002632	I should have gone after them...{nl}I'm so worried now. I hope she's okay...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002633	Demon Lord Zaura took the girl?{nl}Oh no... Zaura is the one who had Goddess Lada taken away by demons in the past.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002634	Be careful when you collect Drowsy Herbs. {nl}There's a reason why they call them that.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002635	Oh, right.{nl}When Zaura took the girl, did you see any ferrets around?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002636	That means the ferrets are keeping the girl.{nl}They know the forest well, you see.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002637	I mean, I was born and raised here so I'm not clueless either.{nl}I think... I can guess where they're hiding her.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002638	It's too dangerous to just go out to save her without a plan, though.{nl}Things could get ugly if they start attacking.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002639	Right. I know a scent that makes ferrets lose their minds.{nl}Will you bring me some Droswy Herbs so I can make some?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002640	This should be enough to make the scent.{nl}Hold on a minute.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002641	Don't worry if you accidentally getting a whiff of the herbs.{nl}I made sure it only affects ferrets.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002642	Here's the scent.{nl}Let's see now... About the ferrets...{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002643	There are a few ferret hideouts around the Balais Highway and the Zelbe Shelter.{nl}That's probably where they're keeping the girl.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002644	When you find the girl, throw the scent pouch I gave you.{nl}When the ferrets react to it, take the girl and come back!{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002645	Here...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002646	I hope my words can reach you...{nl}I am Laima, goddess of destiny and premonition.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002647	Before Medzio Diena, the goddesses lost much of their power.{nl}Because of this, Goddess Lada, unable to resist, was taken away by Demon Lord Zaura.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002648	Zaura is using the life force of Goddess Lada to create an evil contraption called Kruvina.{nl}The same Kruvina to which countless lives were sacrificed in Castlefield.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002649	The evil energy of Kruvina can make objects grow.{nl}Depending on how it is used, it can enhance the power of the demons, too.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002650	By the time I had a vision of this horrible future, it was too late to do anything.{nl}That's why... I sent a young girl to meet you.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002651	Only one person can free this forest from the calamity that fell upon it...{nl}A savior among the Revelators. You.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002652	Take this orb...{nl}Goddess Lada is being held captive at the Seir Rainforest. Please, rescue her and stop the demons' plans...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002653	An outsider...? Hm, you'll have to do.{nl}Hey, um... will you give me a hand?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002654	I'm trying to figure out why the ferrets are siding with the demons.{nl}So I found a way to turn into one and talk to them.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002655	Thing is, they've seen me too many times already.{nl}Even when I turn into a ferret, they recognize my smell and start attacking me.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002656	If that's okay with you, will you turn into a ferret and snoop around for me?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002657	I'm going to make a transformation scroll from the information we collect.{nl}Write everything down. You can't act too awkward as a ferret.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002658	Your observations are pretty detailed.{nl}You should be ready to transform now. Hold on.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002659	Here you go.{nl}The transformation scroll is ready.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002660	From your observations I don't think you'll be awkward at all.{nl}I trust it you'll be comfortable talking to the ferrets.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002661	See if you can find out why the ferrets are siding with the demons.{nl}Don't forget to turn into a ferret first with the scroll.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002662	If the scroll wears out in front of the ferrets they'll come at you, so be careful.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002663	Hm? So what you're saying is...{nl}The ferrets are helping the demons on purpose?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002664	How does...{nl}I can't believe it!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002665	Did the ferrets really say that?{nl}I know you have no reason to lie, but stil...{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002666	I really can't believe it, though.{nl}The ferrets have always been nothing but friendly.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002667	I need to see if they at least still feel some compassion to humans.{nl}I'll try and enchant a piece of wood to look like someone injured.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002668	The wood is going to look like someone who's hurt to whoever looks at it.{nl}Place it close to the ferrets and see if they attack.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002669	Will they attack someone if they're injured? {nl}Nah... If they do, it's even more serious than I thought...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002670	They really attacked the piece of wood?{nl}That's a bad sign. It means they're attacking anyone and everyone...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002671	There's no doubt after this experiment.{nl}The ferrets are very, very dangerous now.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002672	Still, there's no way I can fight all those ferrets.{nl}The most I can do is chase away the ones closest to the village.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002673	There's a type of strong scent that ferrets hate.{nl}If we make a fire and burn this scent, that should keep the ferrets away.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002674	Would you spread the scent around the Bellai Forest Workshop?{nl}It smells a bit... foul, but please do me this favor.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002675	I should make more of the scent.{nl}In case the effect wears out.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002676	Thanks.{nl}I don't think the ferrets are going to go near the workshop now.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002677	It makes mad to think the ferrets are using the scent thanks to the demons' dirty tricks.{nl}I should talk to Widas when I go back.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002678	But I still think there has to be a way to make the ferrets go back to normal.{nl}R-right...?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002679	You've...{nl}You've finally saved me.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002680	When Laima entrusted this forest to me...{nl}She said it would be consumed by a wave of calamity.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002681	And, she said, after the wave has washed away, I would meet you.{nl}The one holding the light of salvation...{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002682	You are the one, the Revelator who will save our world...{nl}I have hope that it will be you now.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002683	The reason behind the red water flowing in this forest and the contaminated crops...{nl}The plan to grow a giant bracken and spread the death spores...{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002684	All of that was possible because of the Kruvina.{nl}But their schemes didn't end there.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002685	After the experiment yielded good results, the demons wanted to create a Kruvina that was even more powerful.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002686	Their plan was to use not human lives...{nl}But mine. The life force of a goddess.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002687	There cannot be a weapon like the Kruvina in our world.{nl}Only you can destroy the Kruvina and stop the demons' plans. {nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002688	Demon Lord Zaura is gravely injured; now is your chance!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002689	The Kruvina may be unfinished...{nl}But the fact that it uses my life force means it cannot be destroyed by human powers.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002690	There is only one way...{nl}I need to impart my power on the orb Laima gave you...{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002691	Alas, most of my power was stolen from me during Medzio Diena, and what was left of it is with the Kruvina device.{nl}If only that power is released... I can use it to help you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002692	You did well.{nl}With the production stopped, the Kruvina cannot be completed.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002693	Even an unfinished Kruvina is too dangerous for this world, however...{nl}It needs to be destroyed before the demons make use of it.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002694	Whatever little power I have recovered, I will entrust it unto you.{nl}You have one chance... Please, destroy the Kruvina.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002695	Before transforming into a ferret, you need to study their behavior.{nl}They're going to know something's up if you act weird.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002696	I'm going to give you an empty scroll so you can take notes on the ferrets.{nl}After that you can transform.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002697	Demon Lord Zaura will never stand for this.{nl}May you be blessed in the name of the goddesses.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002698	The Kruvina... is in the hands of the demons.{nl}I'm glad you, savior, were able to return in safety.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002699	Don't blame yourself.{nl}This is not your fault.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002700	If you hand't stopped the demons' plans, they would have completed the Kruvina.{nl}I believe Laima will be aware of this, too.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002701	That feat alone was immensely important for us.{nl}No one can blame you...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002702	Laima...{nl}How despairing it must have been for her, knowing she was powerless to change what would happen.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002703	I imagine that's why she took it upon herself and drifted away.{nl}To find a solution for this calamity... she had no choice but to walk a lonely path.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002704	Oh...!{nl}I just heard Laima's voice.{nl}She was calling out for you...{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002705	I think it's Laima's statue in Zeraha.{nl}You should go there.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002706	Her voice was calling out for you, yearning.{nl}Hurry and go to the statue of Goddess Laima in Zeraha.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002707	Laima...{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002708	She gave me a sad smile and walked away.{nl}She knew what would happen... And yet, she made a difficult choice...{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002709	Seeing you now, I can try to understand the reason behind her choice.{nl}The meaning of savior... what she saw at the end of this catastrophe.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002710	You said Laima asked you to find the Revelations.{nl}The one closest from here will be in Femidian.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002711	I understand the weight of this task, but we must act now.{nl}It has to be you... No one but you can save Laima.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002712	I will pass onto you the power of Laima's orb.{nl}Let it guide you to the Revelation She has hidden.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002713	Please, save Laima...{nl}Rescue her from the hands of Giltine...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002714	You were brought here by destiny!{nl}Thank you, thank you for rescuing Goddess Lada.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002715	Someday I'm going to rebuild a temple for Goddesses Lada and Laima, when She returns.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002716	But the demons will not give up.{nl}And Lada's condition itself is still unstable.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002717	We would like to chase away the demons left around here, would you help?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002718	Goddess Lada is still not feeling well.{nl}We'll look after Her now.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002719	Thank you.{nl}There are a lot less demons around now.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002720	Now we need to purify the land contaminated by evil energy.{nl}But I don't know how.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002721	This wasn't even the work of demons, but a human...{nl}Widas can't seem to find a solution right away, either.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002722	Not far from here there's a big city called Femidian.{nl}I wonder if there isn't a master there who could come up with something.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002723	Of course I would go there myself but...{nl}We're short-handed as it is here, I don't think it would be right for me to leave.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002724	If you can, I would like you to go to Femidian and ask the masters there for advice.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002725	So the land was contaminated not by demons, but a human...{nl}With the world as it is, who would have thought...?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002726	I have a solution. I'm going to write you a purification scroll.{nl}That should be enough to solve the problem.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002727	One of the masters in Femidian should be able to help us!{nl}I hope so...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002728	You're back already.{nl}Did... you find a master to help us?{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002729	The Druid Master wrote this scroll herself? {nl}That's even better than I expected. Thank you!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002730	I found the source of the contamination.{nl}The demons set up another totem.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002731	This purification scroll should do it but...{nl}With the demons guarding it, I can't get close enough to the totem.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002732	Will you destroy the demon totem and purify it with the scroll?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002733	I can't understand why someone would side with the demons...{nl}How powerful is their evil energy, that even ferrets can't handle it?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002734	Revelator, your help has given us new hope. {nl}We couldn't have solved this without you...{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002735	After the new temple is completed, feel free to come by again, Revelator!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002736	Our people feel safe now that everything's come to an end...{nl}You really are our savior. Thank you, thank you!{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002737	Our people are going to join forces and build a temple for the goddesses now.{nl}By the way, I was looking around the Irbedi Cliff for a spot to build the temple and I found a place with a strong vital force.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002738	I couldn’t do much more because of the demons...{nl}But the energy of that land, I'm sure it'll help Goddess Lada recover Hers.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002739	So I want to ask you.{nl}They say this seed grows a flower that takes on whatever properties of the land where it's planted.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002740	If we plant it on that land, the flower too will have the same life force.{nl}Will you bring that flower to Goddess Lada?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002741	I have never felt a force so powerful.{nl}I only hope this flower can heal the wounds in Goddess Lada's body and spirit...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002742	Even if it happened in accordance with Laima's prophecy, I have fallen and left the townspeople helpless and worried..{nl}My gratitude cannot be expressed through mere words...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002743	And this flower is filled with great life force...{nl}My recovery won't take long with this. Again, thank you...{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002744	Thank you.{nl}May you be blessed by all the living beings in this forest...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002745	If only I can escape the Redemption Ward... I can get my energy back.{nl}Please hurry...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002746	The Kruvina is still being produced.{nl}You need to hurry...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002747	Please lend me just a little more of your strength.{nl}Only you can do this.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002748	A human sided with the demons...{nl}With the world as it is, who would have thought...?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002749	I... feel my conscience fading away...{nl}Hurry and destroy the three devices... before the Kruvina is completed.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002750	Fortunately, should I say... those devices were made by a human...{nl}Your abilities should be enough to destroy them.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002751	The Redemption Ward first...{nl}Please, before I lose my senses...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002752	You... destroyed the Redemption Ward.{nl}I'm fine. I'm just a little dizzy.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002753	Now only the vitality absorption device and the suppressor are left.{nl}If you destroy the vitality absorption device, you'll stop the production of the Kruvina.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002754	The device was made to absorb only the vitality of goddesses...{nl}If it absorbs that of another being it will shut down.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002755	Demon blood, especially, is opposite to my nature, and it will cause an ever stronger reaction on the device.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002756	You really are Laima's chosen one...{nl}I feel like I'm regaining my energy a little now.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002757	Finally, the Kruvina suppressor.{nl}That's the device that collects my vitality and supplies it to the Kruvina.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002758	That much is operated by the demons' magic power alone.{nl}Use Laima's orb to overload the device.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002759	Femidian is a really big city.{nl}Especially because it's close to the Great Cathedral, it's a common destination for pilgrims.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002760	Femidian, too, was afected by Medzio Diena...{nl}But even though the business district was destroyed, a surprising number of people survived.{nl}
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002761	People there think it was because Femidian is in the divine area where the the great statue of Goddess Austeja is.{nl}Now they're hard at work to rebuild the city.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002762	Go down at the Kraijwi Crossings and you should see Femidian.{nl}All right then, I look forward to hear good news from you!
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002763	I'm very glad to hear that.{nl}The totems are close to the Inega Vacant Lot and in the Odur Backyard.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002764	The girl disappeared with the light.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002765	Elder Eloizard
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002766	You must quite talented, coming all the way over here.{nl}I'm the chief of a village downstream from this lake.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002767	We came up here to try and find out why the lake turned red.{nl}I looked around for a while but as I was about to go back I got my path blocked by monsters.{nl}If that's all right, will you give me a hand?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002768	Please.{nl}I just need you to clear out some monsters around here.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002769	Samsonas
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002770	You're the traveller?{nl}I'm going to pray to the goddesses to make the lake clean again. {nl}Before the lake was contaminated I once saw people make offerings to an obelisk around here.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002771	You're the traveller?{nl}I'm going to pray to the goddesses to make the lake clean again. {nl}Before the lake was contaminated I once saw people make offerings to an obelisk around here.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002772	Please do me this favor.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002773	You got it! Thank you for your help.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002774	Nikodemas
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002775	You wouldn't happen to have seen a young man around here?{nl}He said he was just going somewhere but hasn't been back since.{nl}Someone saw him head to the Absenta Reservoir.{nl}If you're going that way, would you look for him?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002776	It'll be okay, I hope...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002777	Isolated Youth
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002778	Thank you.{nl}I was being chased by that huge monster and had to hide here, but it wouldn't move, so I was stuck.{nl}You saved me.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002779	Is everything all right with him?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002780	Scalvis
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002781	So you're the traveller who helped our chief. {nl}After the lake was contaminated there's more monsters around and we're afraid they'll hurt someone.{nl}Will you clear out some around here?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002782	Hopefully we won't run into trouble before we go back to the village.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002783	Thank you for your help.{nl}I hope we can all return safely.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002784	The contaminated lake is a big problem.{nl}We really need to hurry and find a solution...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002785	Lately there's a lot more monsters around, this area is dangerous now.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002786	We came up all together but it's too dangerous here.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002787	Thanks to you I was able to come back to my people.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002788	Hm...?{nl}Why is the ground shaking?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002789	I should go, something could have happened to the villagers.{nl}I apologize if I'm being a little shameless, but would you help us some more?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002790	Where?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002791	That has nothing to do with me.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002792	I'll help you find your colleagues.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002793	Let's go back to Rose.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002794	What are the symptoms?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002795	Tell the Cleric Submaster about Herbalist Tales' symptoms.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002796	Giving the medicine to Herbalist Tales...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002797	Keep looking.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002798	I'll talk to the village resident.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002799	We should hurry.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002800	I'll find the XX essence.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002801	Let's do it later.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002802	I'll help Rose.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002803	I can't help her.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002804	I'll check whether I have a recovery potion.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002805	I'll give you one later.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002806	I'll defeat the demons around here.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002807	I ought to run away, then.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002808	I'll find their belongings.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002809	You find them yourself.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002810	I'll look for them later.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002811	I'll go into the room.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002812	I'll switch off the confinement device.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002813	Ask someone else for help.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002814	I'll go find your backpack.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002815	I'll find it myself.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002816	I'll head to the experiment site.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002817	I'll go later.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002818	I'll get back the holy relic.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002819	I'll set up the holy relic.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002820	I'll set it up myself.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002821	I'll try.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002822	I'm not doing that.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002823	I'll gather some.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002824	I'll remove the crystal.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002825	I'll rescue Rose.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002826	I'll go see the Wizard Submaster.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002827	I'll go later.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002828	Talking about Rose and her brother...
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002829	I'll get the demon essence for you.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002830	I'll get it later.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002831	I'll set it up.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002832	I'll set it up later.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002833	I'll find the experiment journal.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002834	I'll shut down the device.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002835	Let Edmundas do it.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002836	The Demons' Goals
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002837	Are you all right?
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002838	Gotta go, sorry.
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002839	Find Mayor Romanas (1)
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002840	Find Mayor Romanas (2)
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002841	Be careful.

QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002843	Find Mayor Romanas (3)
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002844	Find Mayor Romanas (4)
QUEST_UNUSED_20151102_002845	I'll wait.
