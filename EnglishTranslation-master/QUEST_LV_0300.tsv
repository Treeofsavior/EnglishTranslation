QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000085	Svitrigaila tells you that, as a Revelator, it wouldn't be bad for you to help him commit suicide, and he asks you to gather some poisonous herbs for him.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000091	You gave Svitrigaila the poisonous herbs, and it appears that he ate them, but you don't see any change in him. Try speaking to him again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000092	Seeing as there was no effect on Svitrigaila when he ate the poisonous herbs, it must be that he needs to mix them with holy water first, and then eat them to get the desired result. Find the Cleric Master and get the holy water from him.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000102	According to Svitrigaila, you need to amplify the power of the explosive powder in order to destroy the next terminal, and for that, you'll need to scrape off and collect particles from petrified objects in this area.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000103	Blow up the Terminal
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000104	Use the explosive powder Svitrigaila gave you and the petrification particles you collected to blow up the second terminal.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000105	Ask Svitrigaila what you need to do to destroy the next terminal.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000107	Svitrigaila says that the third terminal will get knocked out if anything comes near it. Retrieve the core from the petrified monsters nearby and throw it at the terminal to destroy it.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000112	Destroy the Soul Compactor
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000113	You have crafted Svitrigaila's Magic Orb. Now take the orb to the Soul Compactor.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000122	You just need to gather the poisonous weeds from the area above us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000123	That area's known for its Bluebane...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000124	Thank you. Let me try eating these one by one...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000125	Just as I feared... I'm still here.{nl}I heard the Cleric Master has holy water that, when mixed with Bluebane, {nl}can easily kill any demon.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000130	I will never involve myself in a demon's work.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000131	I see... I should have expected that...{nl}I was a fool to hope otherwise.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000132	If it comes down this, I guess I'll have to try that method now.{nl}Destroying the Soul Compactor that's here... The beings that sent me here told me.{nl}The Soul Compactor and I are one and the same. Why didn't I remember this until now?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000133	Somewhere in this area is a Soul Compactor that absorbs human souls.{nl}It condenses their energy and uses it.{nl}This is a really suitable location for the Soul Compactor because, {nl}even after the Stone Frost blew through, it's still bustling with the activity of the {nl}Knights of Kaliss, grave robbers, and the soldiers of the Royal Army.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000134	{nl}{nl}If I think about it, the beings that sent me here must have linked my life with the Soul Compactor so that I could collect souls for them forever. So if the Soul Compactor is destroyed, wouldn't I die with it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000135	The Soul Compactor has 3 terminals from which it absorbs souls.{nl}That bad feeling you had earlier was also a terminal trying to absorb your soul.{nl}For now, try to wipe out those terminals.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000136	{nl}If you succeed in destroying a terminal, you should be able to retrieve its core.{nl}You need to collect those cores to craft an orb that will help you destroy the Soul Compactor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000137	Good job. This core will be used to make an orb that will overload the mainframe of the Soul Compactor.{nl}Now I can feel my death drawing near.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000138	Try blowing up the second terminal.{nl}Here, I'll give you some explosives, but you'll need to scrape off some particles from petrified objects in this area to amplify the power of the explosives.{nl}Since the Stone Frost blows through here often, there are plenty of petrified objects everywhere.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000139	Again, you'll need to retrieve the core from this terminal too.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000140	Now there's only one terminal left.. I feel myself getting weaker...{nl}The last terminal is probably short-circuiting.{nl}Try getting cores from petrified monsters in the area and throwing them at the terminal.{nl}That should be enough to make it collapse.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000141	And of course, bring back the core from the last terminal.{nl}Condensed souls are concentrated within those cores... {nl}We just need to use them to craft an orb that will overload the Soul Compactor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000142	Now you've collected them all. Here, I'll give you the manual.{nl}Use this to craft the orb to overload the Soul Compactor.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000143	I just want to rest...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000144	Is this the last time? Really.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000145	Let's see if we have all the detonators.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000147	I feel drained.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000148	Yes. That's it. Give it to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000149	Notice/!/When you touch the device, it feels like your soul is being drained!{nl}You must find someone who can solve this predicament!

QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000164	Holy water?{nl}What do you need it for?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000165	There is a demon who needs holy water at Dingofasil District?{nl}...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000166	{nl}I won't concern myself with your personal matters, but I can't help demons as a cleric.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000167	Maybe this is the only way...{nl}Destroying the Spirit Integration Device...{nl}The ones who sent me here told me that the Spirit Integration Device and I are one. {nl}{nl}How could I forget that?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000168	The Spirit Integration Device absorbs souls from 3 terminals.{nl}The curse from a while ago was the process to absorb souls.{nl}Let's destroy the terminals one by one.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000169	{nl}Then bring the core.{nl}Oh, I'll cast a spell on you so you won't be cursed again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000170	We should destroy the second terminal. {nl}I will give you some bombs, but to amplify the effects of the bombs, you will need some petrified water powder.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000171	We should get the core of the terminal this time as well.{nl}Hmm... the spell has been released so that we won't get hurt by the spell. I will lock it again.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000173	The repair, itself, isn't that hard. It is hard to obtain necessary parts.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000174	You've come back from a long journey. So these are the parts.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000182	By the words of the Royal Army Guard Retia, let's look for the other guards who had been dispatched to the Coastal Fortress. If they got into an accident, please collect their keepsakes. The monsters might have taken them so it would be a good idea to hunt for the monsters at the Coastal Fortress.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000183	Return to Royal Army Guard Retia
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000184	The guards of the Royal Army have unfortunately died. You've collected their corpses so go back to Retia.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000185	Since you've collected all the corpses of the guards who left to the Coastal Fortress to fix the detector, it seems that you will be able to obtain some parts of the detector from Retia. Talk with her.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000212	Revelator! Are you okay?{nl}Petrification powder, it must have been dangerous.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000213	I am guiding the spirits that suffered from the petrified frosts long ago.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000214	But, this petrified frost is the curse of the Demon Queen Gesti...{nl}They make us Kupoles into stones.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000215	We should at least find out when the petrified frosts will blow.{nl}There are some petrification detectors which humans left behind, but some seem to be broken.{nl}Can you help me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000216	The detector you saw seems to be working well.{nl}Please look at how the other detectors are working.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000217	The petrified frosts turn everything into stone. Even spirits.{nl}We, Kupoles, are no exception.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000218	Ah, that's it.{nl}Two of them are broken.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000219	We better ask about the soldiers who created the detectors about them.{nl}I heard the person named Retia is the officer so we may receive some help from her.  
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000220	He is at Verkti Square.{nl}Human matters cannot be resolved by the Kupoles, so we are counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000221	Are you talking about the petrification detector at the Coastal Fortress?{nl}We are already aware of that.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000222	By the way, it hasn't arrived yet? {nl}I've already dispatched the soldiers there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000223	I don't have a good feeling about this.{nl}Due to numerous monster attacks here, we don't have additional forces to send.{nl}Can I ask you to follow the guards who were dispatched for the repair?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000224	Maybe they have been attacked at the Coastal Fortress.{nl}But, they are the guards of the kingdom. Their dead bodies should be brought here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000225	The petrified frosts are reported frequently at the entrance of the Coastal Fortress,{nl}so I think they will be around there. In case you find some corpses, please collect them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000226	I guess it was too late. Thanks for collecting the corpses.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000227	Please come back after fixing the petrification detector.{nl}I have something to say.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000228	I am counting on you to guide all the spirits to the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000229	Lastly, there's some story that they want to tell to the Revelator.{nl}You will want to know why humans are suffering from this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000230	The rumor that the petrified frosts are the sin of the revolt is just a made-up story.{nl}The curse came after the revolt so they may well think so.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000231	But, no. {nl}Everything was their plot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000232	But, the one who broke it first were the demons.{nl}That is this petrified frost... they died and their spirits have become stone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000233	Demon Queen Gesti brought the curse of the petrification on this land,{nl}and the goddesses tried to save the humans. But, the demons asked us whether {nl}we had forgotten not to interfere with each other's matters and...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000234	Wait. This memory is too horrible..{nl}A horrible catatrophe has landed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000235	Like a big disaster that the goddess might abandon to save this petrified place.{nl}These Stone Frosts... All of that... This is what we must suffer through to save that which we abandoned.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000236	I will try to save the spirits from now on.{nl}Since you fixed all the detectors, we will be able to guide the spirits to eternal sleep.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000237	We will do our best to guide each and every one of them.{nl}I hope the goddesses bless you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000238	I guess you can't trust me since a demon like me is asking you a favor.{nl}But, look at me closely. It doesn't matter if you laugh at me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000239	I've tried my best to escape for hundreds of years.{nl}But, the curse of the petrification is the power of the Demon Queen. {nl}This endless depression is suffocating me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000240	Even if you escape, you're still a traitor.{nl}You'll be called a "traitor" while at the feet of the colleagues who mocked you...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000241	If you cooperate towards my death, I will definitely remove your curse.{nl}I promise in the name of Giltine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000242	It doesn't matter what happens to my body.{nl}I just want to rest...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000243	The poisonous plant that grows up there would be able to take my life away.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000244	I will pray that a plant that is poisonous to humans brings me eternal sleep.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000245	Thanks. Now, I will pray for the end of my agonizing life.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000246	So nothing occurs as I expected.{nl}If that's the case... We can't say we are in distress. We just have to rely on the one that we demons want to eliminate.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000247	Please bring the divine water from the one who follows the call of the goddesses.{nl}That sacred power will lead me to death.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000248	I heard the Cleric Master handles that divine water.{nl}I don't know if he's going to give me any.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000249	Are you talking about divine water?{nl}I am sorry, but may I ask you where you are going to use it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000250	There are demons who need the divine water?{nl}I am sorry, but I can't help you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000251	I am not going to be involved in your personal matter.{nl}No matter what the reasons are, I can't help demons' matters as a priest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000252	As a priest, I can't cooperate on the tasks of the demons.{nl}I hope you understand this as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000253	So... that's it.{nl}Maybe, we came to expect something that we shouldn't expect.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000254	The people who I believed to be my colleagues betrayed me. {nl}Then, there is no reason for me to hold on to this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000255	The demon lord has ordered me to collect the spirits of humans that will be dedicated to the god.{nl}That's why we began working on creating the integrator which would collect the spirits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000256	The process was smooth, but I suffered from the petrified frosts.{nl}They laughed and told me,{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000257	That I will be the soure of magic of the integrator.{nl}How did I come to forget this...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000258	You must know by now.{nl}The curse that has been put on the barrier stone... we use it to pull spirits from humans.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000259	The spirits that were pulled will be gathered to the integrator and dedicated to the god.{nl}The god.. it is like me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000260	The integrator is being protected by three barrier stones.{nl}Destroy the barrier stones down there and obtain the cores from them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000261	I will cast a spell on you so that you won't get cursed again.{nl}The integrator moves by consuming my vitality so it's easy for me. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000262	The guys who abandoned me and laughed at me can't be called our colleagues.{nl}I will get my revenge by killing them. I will make them regret that they treated me like a source of magic.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000263	Well done. My death is near.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000264	The next barrier stone is up there. {nl}We have to put in great power all at once. Like an explosion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000265	Okay.. there was a grave robber among the ones who were sacrificed.{nl}I tried to lead myself into death using a bomb, but it was useless.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000266	We should not forget about the core of the barrier stone.{nl}To avoid being cursed again, I will cast a spell again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000267	How come I never thought about this.{nl}Maybe my loyalty has surpassed the fear of loneliness.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000268	The last barrier stone must be exploding by now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000269	As the monsters were being petrified, their last breaths were also solidified... Throw those against barrier stones.{nl}They will gradually collapse.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000270	The core of the barrier stone is composed of condensed spirits.{nl}We will make orbs by collecting those that would destroy the integrator.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000271	I will put the last of my power into the cores of the barrier stones which you've collected.{nl}Pull out monsters' detonators with this and make an orb.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000272	Of course, I will give you a method to make the orb.{nl}The orb that would destroy the integrator.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000273	And, please fulfill my last wish.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000274	I've handed over the method to make the orb with my power.{nl}It will be easy to make an orb.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000275	Succeeded...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000276	Do you know the meaning of the name Giltine?{nl}Her name means death. The only thing that I can rely on at the moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000277	I once thought that I didn't care what I turn myself into if it was for the demons long ago.{nl}But, only petrified frosts blew to me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000278	I started to get solidified for hundreds of years.{nl}My name has been erased from everyone's minds.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000279	Even if she doesn't bring me eternal rest, it will be better than now.{nl}I just want to rest...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000280	Death is coming to me.{nl}I feel good.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000281	Yes. That's it. Give it to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000282	Within the keepsakes you've found for me...{nl}There must be some parts that will fix the detector at the Coastal Fortress.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000283	Here it is. {nl}The repair shouldn't be that hard.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000284	The Royal Army was taught that they should be loyal and honorable to the kingdom.{nl}And to be committed to due diligence when engaging in their duties.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000285	You came back a long way.{nl}So these are the parts to fix the petrification detector.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000286	It must have been hard to obtain the parts, but the repair itself shouldn't be that hard.{nl}Let's return.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000287	Pillar
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000288	(It seems like something is written on the pillar.)
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000289	(It seems that some letters are visible, but I can't clearly see them.)
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000290	To be able to read the letters, you must have a piece of the symbol.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000291	{nl}You can obtain the piece of the symbol somewhere in Galeed Plateau.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000292	(Something is written, but is not legible.)
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000293	(It seems that something is written on it, but it can't be read in this condition.)
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000294	That ring was given to me by my mother.{nl}I want to go back home with it, back to where my mother is...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000295	Our house is in the inner castle district...{nl}Please... I want to go back home with the ring...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000296	Yes. Gailus Legwyn is my old friend...{nl}But even an old friend shouldn't just take a precious object and not return it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000297	If her father is dead, then she should pay for the debt!{nl}Besides, I didn't even see that lady named Justina.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000298	I don't care who she is. It doesn't matter as long as she brings back my object.{nl}I don't care if that woman really is his daughter or not.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000299	I'm not doing any more trades.{nl}Why do I have to experience this kind of shame?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000300	I want to see Justina...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000301	I feel like I age a hundred years whenever I deal with Pardoners.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000302	If I can get back what's mine, I won't return to this place.{nl}His daughter is a successful woman, so she can take care of it.{nl}You better not get involved with these guys.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000304	This place is a military strategic point and it is also a dangerous area.{nl}You should be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000305	It is hard to maintain the army after the supplies stopped coming from the lower land.{nl}The problem is that the circumstances down there are more severe.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000306	We better do our duty fast...{nl}We just have to hang tight a little longer...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000307	I am not sure how to return to the army.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000308	Soldier Baskez
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000309	It will be our end if we sleep here.{nl}We better move our unit a little bit.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000310	We are going to freeze to death instead of dying from hunger.{nl}Are there any better options?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000311	Thank you so much for saving me last time.{nl}I want to help you, but I am tied to the army...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000312	This place is too cold.{nl}You can clearly see that I can't even move my neck an inch.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000313	Military Courier Rochez
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000314	I have an important duty to do, but those guys are troubling me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000315	Mesafasla is suffering because of the monsters, though this place is also harsh.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000316	I was able to return to the army because of you. Thanks.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000317	I don't know why I volunteered myself to be a military courier.{nl}My tasks are becoming harder ever since monsters went crazy.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000318	Supply Officer Ronda
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000319	Supplies are running out, but we still have many people.{nl}You know, I actually rather wish that they would all run away.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000320	We get some supplies from hunting the monsters nearby... It's not enough, though...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000321	There are some potatoes that are growing at Skaika Supply Route.{nl}It's not hard to pick them up...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000322	I am the only supply officer on duty, so I don't have time to pick those potatoes.{nl}If by any chance you visit that place, I would appreciate if you got me some potatoes.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000323	I feel embarassed to have asked you this...{nl}I'm sorry, but I don't have any other choice.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000324	I won't have any strength to fight by just eating meat.{nl}Everyone knows it's important to eat a variety of food.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000325	Since this place is colder than other areas, it is important to consume nutritious food.{nl}As a supply officer, I am having a hard time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000326	An outsider better go down from the mountains.{nl}You will either freeze to death or die from hunger.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000327	Although the kingdom has become famous, we are still soldiers.{nl}This is the military district and if you are an outsider, please leave.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000328	I heard that this place was used as a workhouse.{nl}We are able to find old materials easily, but the problem is the food shortage.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000329	I am worried since the number of my men who are running away is increasing.{nl}Our supplies will last longer, but I am worried that I may become the only one left.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000336	Soldier Motimer
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000337	If he didn't have a firm control on the storage of the workshop, we wouldn't have suffered so much.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000338	Are they suffering like us because of the monsters down there?

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000684	Of course I won!{nl}But, I dropped his necklace into the sea which I've received as an evidence.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000685	Back then, I gave up since the sea was too deep...{nl}But I would be able to find it now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000686	If I can find it, I think I will be able to deal a blow to those who says I am a bluff.{nl}It is nearby Kranto Coast. {nl}You are a Corsair who is acknowledged by me, so you will be able to find it quickly.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000691	If you are a Doppelsoeldner, there is a task that you should do for the kingdom.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000694	The last contact was from Fasika Plateau.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000695	That's so unfortunate. They've probably been attacked by the demons.{nl}You have all my support since you became an important member of the Doppelsoeldner.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000696	Ah, please keep this a secret to the others.{nl}I will find another way to contact General Ramin.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000702	First, I need you to get me the materials, so I can prepare it.{nl}I will write down the necessary materials and the locations to get those materials.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000703	This will be enough.{nl}We were able to finish this quickly because of your help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000704	It will take some time before we can extract the substances...{nl}In the meantime, I will teach you alchemy.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000707	The Scout Master and I used be the best friends.{nl}However, our relationship now is not as close as it used to be.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000708	In an effort to become closer, I want to give a present...{nl}I want to give something that the Scout Master likes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000709	Are you prepared for what I am going to request of you?

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000711	But, what if the monsters die...{nl}Unfavorable flavors may get mixed unless you pull them out when they are alive.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000712	To give you a hint, you better catch someone from behind.{nl}Understood?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000713	You've collected enough of them as expected.{nl}By fulfilling this request, I can tell that you won't have a problem learning the last skill.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000714	There are many people who have the same level of competence like you...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000715	Well, alright.{nl}Though, you need to understand that this will cost a lot from you, {nl}if you want to learn this at your current level.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000716	I've been searching for the arrows that the first Fletcher Master created from a long time ago.{nl}Those arrows were given to Lydia Schaffen as a present.{nl}I am certain that these arrows contain some sort of special skill.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000717	Recently, I've obtained useful information about the whereabouts of those arrows...{nl}There is a person who is able to identify the true value of those arrows.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000718	So, I've heard that the arrows are at Galeed Plateau.{nl}They were used when facing against some violent monster, so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000719	Oh. I've only seen it for a short period of time, but I can tell how amazing it is.{nl}I want to do a research on this arrow immediately, {nl}but I've made a promise with you, so that's the first thing I'm going to do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000720	Okay... Let's get started.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000721	As a Falconer Master, I am always looking at different options to make Falconers stronger.{nl}Recently, I've been thinking how I can make those flying monsters of use to us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000722	Of course I am satisfied with my partner, Rith..{nl}I think these attempts are helpful to Falconers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000723	When we tame a hawk, maybe we should feed it something?{nl}I don't have high expectations, but we better go there and try it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000724	I've placed some food for you to try it on at least three different types of monsters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000725	Did we fail... {nl}I expected it though.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000726	Regardless of the result, I should reward you for your effort.{nl}The biggest reward I can give to you would be teaching you new skills.{nl}What do you think?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000727	Shoot at an enemy and hit it...{nl}That's one of the basics of a Schwarzer Reiter.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000728	So you want to learn new skills, huh? {nl}Hitting an enemy with our eyes closed? How does that sound?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000729	Hahaha. However, we aren't blind. {nl}We shouldn't go that far, right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000730	I'm liking your confidence!{nl}I like it so much that we're going to put it to the test.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000731	Your objective is to consecutively hit the targets with an accurate aim.{nl}If you are able to do that, I will acknowledge your skills.{nl}So... I'd say about 200 times? Hm, I think that's too easy for you?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000732	I knew it wasn't a bluff! It was the confidence, am I right?!{nl}As promised, I will gladly become your teacher.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000733	The way of a true Monk...{nl}One should push oneself to extreme limits and endure the harsh training.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000734	If you are willing to take the challenge, then we will start immediately.{nl}Talk to me once you are ready for it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000735	Hurry up and stop talking to me!{nl}If you don't defeat enough enemies within the time limit, I will count again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000736	Very good.{nl}Now is the time for you to learn something from me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000737	I know that you are ready to be a good Pardoner...{nl}But I'm kind of in big trouble.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000738	Well, those impious monsters ripped off the book of offerings.{nl}Because of that, I can't proceed with my other tasks.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000739	I will tell you the location if you can get me that preliminary book.{nl}I think of you as a trustworthy person since we are close...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000740	The preliminary book is at Elkosh Abbey Hospital.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000741	In order to prevent someone from taking them, I've hidden them in the books...{nl}And I've prepared several fake books, so I want you to find them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000742	This is correct place.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000743	Welcome.{nl}I am looking for someone who is willing to help me with my research.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000744	Four years have passed after Medzio Diena...{nl}The aftermath of this disaster hasn't gone down, but it's getting bigger instead.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000745	Especially the plants that have grown so big turned into monsters and dealt a lot of damage.{nl}I am continuously doing research to resolve this issue.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000746	If you can help me with my research, I will teach you the next level of the Druid.{nl}I believe this will be an adequate assignment for you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000747	Please get me samples from the plants who have turned into monsters.{nl}You can obtain more samples the stronger the monster is.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000748	I know that my request was not easy to complete, but you've done it!{nl}These samples that you have brought me are excellent and are helpful in my research.{nl}As promised, I will help you since you helped me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000749	I know what business you have with me...{nl}That aside, we have something more important going on right now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000750	Suddenly, evil energy has become stronger in the place I used to look at with divine power.{nl}Using Clairvoyance doesn't even work anymore for me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000751	I'm asking you if you could get rid of the evil energy that's lurking there?{nl}If you do, I promise you that I will help you reach the next level.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000752	The location is Galeed Plateau.{nl}Please put the Purification of Namott that I gave you to the area where the evil energy is strong. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000753	I knew you were the right person to do this.{nl}As promised, I will lead you to the next level of the Oracle.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000754	Good. Let's get started right away.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000755	You need to fight the monsters until the time limit expires.{nl}As you defeat stronger monsters, I will acknowledge that you've went through hard training..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000756	If you don't defeat them within the time limit, you start from scratch. {nl}Be cautious.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000757	Dragoon Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000758	A Dragoon should never move too far away from an enemy when in danger.{nl}The Dragoon needs to have the courage to fight harder, better, faster and stronger.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000759	We reject the courage of those who fight without skills.{nl}The path of the Dragoon is a difficult path.{nl}So if you've came here without a strong determination, I suggest you leave now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000760	Alright, let's see if you really are worthy enough to become one of us.{nl}Show me your skills.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000761	Your objective is to battle monsters and embrace the pain. Do not move away from them.{nl}That's the determination of a courageous Dragoon. {nl}So, attack and defeat the monsters even if you take damage from them. {nl}Good luck.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000762	What's this? We don't want anyone with a careless mind.{nl}Since I like you, I am giving you another chance. {nl}Come on, show me your courage and your skills!
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000763	Excellent. You did good.{nl}From this day forward, I will acknowledge you as a member of the Dragoons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000764	Are you interested in becoming a Templar?{nl}I can already tell that you are very smart for making this choice.{nl}Now, let me give you a walkthrough of what you need to be aware of.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000765	A Templar is a leader to many people. We need people with strong leadership skills.{nl}Especially during these times, a Templar's leadership is most likely required.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000766	Don't get me wrong, though. This is often misunderstood as 'authority'.{nl}No, I'm leaning more towards 'cooperation'.{nl}You should cooperate with your followers in order to maintain a group.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000767	Do you understand what I am trying to tell you?{nl}With that being said, let's see your skills as a Templar.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000768	A person in authority makes orders, but a Templar should make requests.{nl}Your task is to recruit five people and become their leader in that group.{nl}While being the leader of the group, you have to lead them for quite some time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000769	The fuel that drives people is the respect.{nl}So, to confirm if you possess this charm, I will put you up to the test.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000770	Oh, I absolutely do not like to be deceived by tricks or anything like that.{nl}Recruit five people all by yourself and become the leader of the group.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000771	Well done.{nl}You are certainly much more charming than I expected.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000772	It can be tough to make other people follow you.{nl}The more people following you, the tougher it becomes.{nl}It's not easy, but a Templar with great respect and admiration can pull it off.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000773	I will tell you the things that a Templar must have knowledge in.{nl}I hope you will make wise and careful decisions in the future, so do not forget this.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000774	Warlock Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000775	We will take any measures by any means for the goddesses...{nl}That is the strict rule that we, Warlocks, must abide by.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000776	There are many people who misunderstand our interpretations.{nl}A Warlock and its evil spirits are not equally contracted.{nl}We have to rule over them and able to control the evil spirits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000777	In order to do so, you need to possess strong magic able to rule and control the evil spirits.{nl}Unless... you want to get eaten up by them. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000778	Since you don't know these evil spirits that well like I do...{nl}I will give you a scroll that will wake them up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000779	Use this scroll on monsters at Valius' Eternal Resting Place to wake up the sleeping evil spirits.{nl}To add another part of this challenge, you need to defeat a monster and the evil spirits.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000780	Get rid of the poison with poison. {nl}Anything else that is evil should be gotten rid of by the evil spirits. {nl}I am waiting for the day when we, the Warlocks, are not needed anymore.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000781	Excellent.{nl}This is much better than I had expected.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000782	From now on, you will tread the path of the Warlock. {nl}Oh, and please remember this...{nl}If you don't stand on top of them, you will be consumed by them...{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000783	Featherfoot Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000784	I don't know how you found out about the curse of the Featherfoot, but...{nl}This curse should not be overused. Rather, it needs some detailed calculations.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000785	Of course, I can teach you if you still want to. However...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000786	Since you don't know anything about the curse, I ask you to take these incantation tools.{nl}I told you that it requires detailed calculations before using the curse.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000787	Find out what there is to lose and what there is to gain...{nl}Use these incantation tools to cast the curse on a monster to find out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000788	If you learn something here, you will become a great Featherfoot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000789	The curse should not be overused, but instead it requires some detailed calculations.{nl}Experience what the magic used by a Featherfoot is like with help of the tools.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000790	Now, do you have a broader understanding of the Featherfoot's curse?{nl}You should not consider it like the curse that is used by Demon Lords like Naktis.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000791	The arrows of the curse shall only be used on the enemies of the goddesses.{nl}For us, that is our most important guideline. Please keep that in mind.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000792	Cannoneer Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000793	You enrolled to become a Cannoneer? Good choice, hotshot.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000794	Listen up! The most important attribute of the Cannoneer is firepower, a lot of it!{nl}If a Cannoneer cannot distinguish between aerial attacks and ground attacks, {nl}he or she isn't a valuable asset to the team!{nl}Enemies that are flying in the air should only be attacked by aerial attacks,{nl}and enemies that are on the ground should only be attacked by ground attacks.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000795	I figured you should know about this if you want to become a skilled Cannoneer, like me.{nl}What about it, hotshot? You interested?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000796	Good! Alright, hotshot. {nl}I can only assume that you will remember what I will teach you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000797	Do you have a paper and pen with you? Remember this.{nl}There are many types of enemies, but the ones that are flying in the air are all aerial-type.{nl}In contrast, the ones that are moving on the ground are considered a walking-type.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000798	Alright, face against monsters with both these types.{nl}You need to understand how each enemy moves and which attacks are effective.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000799	The flying monsters are aerial-types and the ones that move on the ground are walking-types.{nl}Face against both types of monsters. Understood?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000800	Good.{nl}Was this a good lesson? Am I a good teacher?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000801	Alrighty then! Theoretically, you should know all the logic about what I've taught you.{nl}It's time to put the theory into practice!{nl}The skills of a Cannoneer are not easy, so make sure to focus!
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000802	Muskeeteer Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000803	A Muskeeteer should know how to handle a rifle.{nl}Not many enemies can stand against simultaneous firing by well trained Musketeers.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000805	One of the basic aspects of marksmanship is to procure range.{nl}Give it a shot. Attack an enemy at maximum range.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000806	It's not just extending the range, but to extend it up the {nl}maximum distance where you are able to shoot.{nl}I am going to put you to the test to see how well you perform.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000807	It's not just extending the range, but to extend it up the {nl}maximum distance where you are able to shoot.{nl}If you want to become a Musketeer, you will accept my challenge.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000986	It seems as if I am in a daze because of the monster attacks.{nl}I think I discarded invaluable research materials while I was tidying them up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000987	The discarded documents should be gathered at Menka Knoll... Could you look for them?{nl}I can't manage to get there because of the increase in monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000988	I'm sure that you'll be able to find them if you take a close look at the discarded documents there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000989	The documents you need to find is the Research Material List for Alemeth Forest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000990	You can leave the rest of the documents behind.{nl}Please check carefully not to get them mixed up with anything else.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000991	Did you check them carefully?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000992	It seems like you've brought the correct documents.{nl}Go see Sarma after you give me the documents.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000993	I think he's kept an eye on your skills.{nl}I think he wants to ask you something after seeing you help me out.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000994	Sarma
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000995	Ah, greetings.{nl}I assume you've heard of me from Gatre.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000996	I've been keeping a close eye on you since you helped Gatre.{nl}At first I was merely curious of an outsider here, but you seem to be quite talented.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000997	As you may be well aware of, it is hard to do any research because of the monsters.{nl}I think I'll be able to finish my research if you help me out a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000998	It's for the wellbeing of the people here so I beg that you help out.{nl}Of course I shall pay handsomely when the research is finished.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000999	I thank you.{nl}My first request is for you to gather the blood of Green Eldigos.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001000	I need to extract the blood from a live Green Eldigo for my research, but that's no easy task.{nl}I'll give you some Tranquilizer Powder to knock {nl}the Green Eldigos out and bring some blood back.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001001	So, how did it go?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001002	Very good. Excellent.{nl}I think I'd be confident in asking you to do more tasks.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001003	I'll go to the Forest of Prayer Entrance and prepare for the final experiment.{nl}You go and gather the ingredients needed for the last experiment.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001004	Gatre has the list for the ingredients I need for the final experiment so you can get it from him.{nl}I have faith in you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001005	Sarma said that he needed all of the ingredients on the list?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001006	Oh no, it seems as if he's already beginning the final experiment!{nl}We have to find more evidence before it is too late.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001007	It would be strange to not collect the ingredients without proper evidence.{nl}Collect the listed ingredients since you can't we can't risk him suspecting anything.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001008	Why don't we gather some evidence together since Sarma seems to be absent.{nl}I know just what to look for.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001009	There are research notes from a person that used to help Sarma's experiments.{nl}His name was Boldas... and is in a coma because of an unfortunate accident.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001010	Sarma had those notes until he lost them in a monster attack.{nl}Come to think of it, I think Sarma was especially nervous about losing those notes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001011	There may be important information in those notes.{nl}He lost the notes towards the Juice Collection Site, so try searching that area first.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001012	Don't forget the listed ingredients either.{nl}I'll do what Sarma asked in order to avoid suspicion.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001013	Do you have all of the ingredients?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001014	Hmm. There seems to be something missing...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001015	Ah! It seems that it's missing from the list.{nl}I thought I had written everything down, but mistakes where made...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001016	I'm sorry, but could you go get some fermented fruit tree sap from Gatre?{nl}I can't proceed with the experiment without it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001017	Sarma told you that he needed fermented fruit tree sap right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001018	He really has come close to finishing the experiments.{nl}You see, I had removed the sap from the list on purpose.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001019	By the way, how does Sarma's research seem to you?{nl}Did you find anything suspicious in the research notes?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001020	I think that's a good idea.{nl}We might be able to find some clues as to what Sarma is really up to.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001021	That was written in the notes?{nl}I'll need to take a look at the notes myself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001022	Oh my...{nl}If these notes are true, then Sarma definitely has other plans for his research.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001023	But the matter still stands that we don't have any actual proof.{nl}I'll look for some solid evidence if you can manage to stall the experiments a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001024	Take something that is similar to the sap in order to ruin Sarma's experiment.{nl}Meanwhile, I'll check all of his research documents.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001025	I'll give you this tree sap.{nl}All you have to do is to go to the Research Material Warehouse {nl}and find something that looks similar to this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001026	He has to mix all the ingredients before commencing the last stage anyways.{nl}So he won't be able to tell them apart as long as they look similar.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001027	Is this water from... near Pelke Shrine Ruins?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001028	I've heard that something bad happened there...{nl}Well, I suppose it will be alright.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001029	Take this to Sarma since they look almost identical at a glance.{nl}I'll take a peek at his research documents and try to find out his true purpose.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001030	Be careful just in case.{nl}I'll get to you as soon as I find something.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001031	What took you so long in bringing me one more ingredient?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001032	Well, it seems as if you've brought the proper ingredient.{nl}This is the last stage of the experiment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001033	Now all that is left is to but this on the Transmutation Magic Circle and inserting magic.{nl}I've set it so that anyone can power it with magic, so you should have no trouble. {nl}Now go and power the magic circle.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001034	T-That's... because I have other things to do.{nl}I have to leave records of the experiment and observe the situation you see.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001035	Now stop stalling and go power up the Transmutation Magic Circle.{nl}All you have to do is put the ingredients on the circle {nl}and emancipate the magic from the tombstone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001036	But remember that the magic in the tombstone can only be emancipated from the front.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001037	Has the liquid properly been created?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001038	Ahah.{nl}It seems that I finally have results for this research.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001039	Now all I have to do is check to see if the liquid has the intended effect.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001040	Thanks to you, I've been able to get the research, which had been progressing slowly, this far.{nl}With this, we'll be able to restore the enlargened fruit trees back to normal.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001041	How about you spray the liquid onto the trees yourself since you've helped me so far.{nl}If properly made, it will make the trees go back to their original states.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001042	Here, I'll give you some of the liquid.{nl}We'll be able to see if it has any effect immediately.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001043	Try spraying it on the Pile of Leaves just ahead of you.{nl}You'll be able to see something quite interesting.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001044	I'm sorry.{nl}I wasn't able to catch Sarma.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001045	Thankfully, the liquid wasn't created as Sarma planned.{nl}Even though he seems to think that it is perfect.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001046	Sarma's original plan was to create monsters that he could command.{nl}Thankfully, they don't seem to listen to him since we switched the ingredients a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001047	I'll go looking for Sarma.{nl}Even though the liquid is a failure, it's still quite dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001048	I hope that the hidden items will be found and used by whomever sees this inside the pot.{nl}There is another pot at the Old Camp that shows the location of the hidden items.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001049	Monster attacks have been too frequent lately.{nl}That's why Sarma's research is being delayed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001050	Don't forget to read the last part of the instruction manual.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001051	It will be hard to find the documents at Menka Knoll if you don't read them carefully.{nl}There's a lot of documents that are actually being disposed there as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001052	I've put my whole life's achievements on restoring Alemeth Forest to its original state.{nl}This research must succeed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001053	Anyone would be upset about losing their notes.{nl}But Sarma... seemed to be much more than upset at the loss.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001054	The contents of those notes might prove to be important evidence.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001055	If you do get caught, just say that it was a simple mistake.{nl}The important thing is to buy us some more time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001056	First, help Sarma with his experiments.{nl}I'll try to find some evidence in the meantime.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001057	The magic from the tombstone must be emancipated from the front.{nl}The front is the side with the letters on it, so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001058	It is finally time for my research to come to fruitation...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001059	I had merely panicked a bit because of the sudden attack.{nl}I am not frightened of such monsters!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001060	I am conducting research in order to restore the forest to its original state.{nl}Those fruits are inedible you see...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001061	It was hard getting a chance to talk to you because of Sarma.{nl}Now, I can tell you everything since he's gone.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001062	I can't believe he was researching how to control monsters...{nl}I'm having a hard time believing how a person could even {nl}think of doing so even after witnessing it with my two eyes.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001063	They've all left because of the fruits that are inedible no matter how large they are.{nl}But how could you turn your back on your hometown?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001064	What do you think the real purpose for Sarma's research?{nl}I just hope that I'm worrying over nothing...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001065	The villagers all believed in Sarma and his research...{nl}How could he do such a thing?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001066	You're an outsider that I haven't seen before.{nl}I don't know what you're doing here, but please don't interrupt my research.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001067	Everything is going as planned except for those monsters.{nl}They're hindering my research so much that it's become more than a mere nuisance.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001068	I wish to show you the research once it is complete.{nl}Of course I will show it to Gatre who's been helping me all along as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001069	At last, the day that my research reaches fruitation has come...{nl}It is a relief that I was able to receive help from someone as able as you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001070	Necromancer Lemija
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001071	Adomas is late...{nl}Where could he be?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001072	Where have Adomas and Faustas gone to when we have so much to do...{nl}Have you seen any Necromancers around here by any chance?
