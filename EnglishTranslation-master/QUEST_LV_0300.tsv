QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000084	Gather Poisonous Weeds
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000085	Svitrigaila tells you that, as a Revelator, it wouldn't be bad for you to help him commit suicide, and he asks you to gather some poisonous herbs for him.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000091	You gave Svitrigaila the poisonous herbs, and it appears that he ate them, but you don't see any change in him. Try speaking to him again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000092	Seeing as there was no effect on Svitrigaila when he ate the poisonous herbs, it must be that he needs to mix them with holy water first, and then eat them to get the desired result. Find the Cleric Master and get the holy water from him.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000093	Destroy the Terminal
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000094	Talk with Svitrigaila some more.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000102	According to Svitrigaila, you need to amplify the power of the explosive powder in order to destroy the next terminal, and for that, you'll need to scrape off and collect particles from petrified objects in this area.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000103	Blow up the Terminal
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000104	Use the explosive powder Svitrigaila gave you and the petrification particles you collected to blow up the second terminal.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000105	Ask Svitrigaila what you need to do to destroy the next terminal.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000106	Destroy the Terminal
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000107	Svitrigaila says that the third terminal will get knocked out if anything comes near it. Retrieve the core from the petrified monsters nearby and throw it at the terminal to destroy it.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000109	Now that you've gotten rid of all the terminals, return to Svitrigaila.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000112	Destroy the Soul Compactor
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000113	You have crafted Svitrigaila's Magic Orb. Now take the orb to the Soul Compactor.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000121	Who cares what happens to this body that I can't move, or even escape from.{nl}I just want to rest a little.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000122	You just need to gather the poisonous weeds from the area above us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000123	That area's known for its Bluebane...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000124	Thank you. Let me try eating these one by one...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000125	Just as I feared... I'm still here.{nl}I heard the Cleric Master has holy water that, when mixed with Bluebane, {nl}can easily kill any demon.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000127	Have a safe journey to Klaipeda.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000128	...?{nl}The soulkeeper of Dingofasil District?{nl}Isn't he a demon?

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000130	I will never involve myself in a demon's work.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000131	I see... I should have expected that...{nl}I was a fool to hope otherwise.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000132	If it comes down this, I guess I'll have to try that method now.{nl}Destroying the Soul Compactor that's here... The beings that sent me here told me.{nl}The Soul Compactor and I are one and the same. Why didn't I remember this until now?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000133	Somewhere in this area is a Soul Compactor that absorbs human souls.{nl}It condenses their energy and uses it.{nl}This is a really suitable location for the Soul Compactor because, {nl}even after the Petrifying Frost blew through, it's still bustling with the activity of the {nl}Knights of Kaliss, grave robbers, and the soldiers of the Royal Army.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000134	{nl}{nl}If I think about it, the beings that sent me here must have linked my life with the Soul Compactor so that I could collect souls for them forever. So if the Soul Compactor is destroyed, wouldn't I die with it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000135	The Soul Compactor has 3 terminals from which it absorbs souls.{nl}That bad feeling you had earlier was also a terminal trying to absorb your soul.{nl}For now, try to wipe out those terminals.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000136	{nl}If you succeed in destroying a terminal, you should be able to retrieve its core.{nl}You need to collect those cores to craft an orb that will help you destroy the Soul Compactor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000137	Good job. This core will be used to make an orb that will overload the mainframe of the Soul Compactor.{nl}Now I can feel my death drawing near.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000138	Try blowing up the second terminal.{nl}Here, I'll give you some explosives, but you'll need to scrape off some particles from petrified objects in this area to amplify the power of the explosives.{nl}Since the Petrifying Frost blows through here often, there are plenty of petrified objects everywhere.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000139	Again, you'll need to retrieve the core from this terminal too.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000140	Now there's only one terminal left.. I feel myself getting weaker...{nl}The last terminal is probably short-circuiting.{nl}Try getting cores from petrified monsters in the area and throwing them at the terminal.{nl}That should be enough to make it collapse.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000141	And of course, bring back the core from the last terminal.{nl}Condensed souls are concentrated within those cores... {nl}We just need to use them to craft an orb that will overload the Soul Compactor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000142	Now you've collected them all. Here, I'll give you the manual.{nl}Use this to craft the orb to overload the Soul Compactor.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000143	I just want to rest...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000144	Is this the last time? Really.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000145	Let's see if we have all the detonators.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000146	You've come... but it's already time for me to go.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000147	I feel drained.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000148	Yes. That's it. Give it to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000149	Notice/!/When you touch the device, it feels like your soul is being drained!{nl}You must find someone who can fix this situation!

QUEST_LV_0300_20150730_000157	As I expected, we have to get the Terminal Core again.{nl}Hmm... I'll cast a protection spell on you so the Terminal won't defeat you like before.{nl}I have enough strength left for that, at least.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000163	You need to move on to repair.{nl}Be careful of the Petrifying Frost.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000164	Holy water?{nl}What do you need it for?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000165	There is a demon who needs holy water at Dingofasil District?{nl}...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000166	{nl}I won't concern myself with your personal matters, but I can't help demons as a cleric.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000167	Maybe this is the only way...{nl}Destroying the Spirit Integration Device...{nl}The ones who sent me here told me that the Spirit Integration Device and I are one. {nl}{nl}How could I forget that?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000168	The Spirit Integration Device absorbs souls from 3 terminals.{nl}The curse from a while ago was the process to absorb souls.{nl}Let's destroy the terminals one by one.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000169	{nl}Then bring the core.{nl}Oh, I'll cast a spell on you so you won't be cursed again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000170	We should destroy the second terminal. {nl}I will give you some bombs, but to amplify the effects of the bombs, you will need some petrified water powder.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000171	We should get the Terminal Core this time as well.{nl}Hmm... the spell has been released so that we won't get hurt by the spell. I will lock it again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000172	Here it is.{nl}The broken detector can be easily fixed with these parts.{nl}If the parts don't stay in place very well, get some strings from the nearby monsters and use them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000173	The repair, itself, isn't that hard. It is hard to obtain necessary parts.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000174	You've come back from a long journey. So these are the parts.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000182	By the words of the Royal Army Guard Retia, let's look for the other guards who had been dispatched to the Coastal Fortress. If they got into an accident, please collect their keepsakes. The monsters might have taken them so it would be a good idea to hunt for the monsters at the Coastal Fortress.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000183	Return to Royal Army Guard Retia
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000184	The guards of the Royal Army have unfortunately died. You've collected their corpses so go back to Retia.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000185	Since you've collected all the corpses of the guards who left to the Coastal Fortress to fix the detector, it seems that you will be able to obtain some parts of the detector from Retia. Talk with her.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000212	Revelator! Are you okay?{nl}The Petrifying Frost, it's really dangerous.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000213	I am guiding the spirits that suffered from the Petrifying Frost long ago.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000214	But, the Petrifying Frost is the curse of the Demon Queen Gesti...{nl}It make us Kupoles turn into stone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000215	We should at least find out when the Petrifying Frost will blow.{nl}There are some petrification detectors which humans left behind, but some seem to be broken.{nl}Can you help me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000216	The detector you saw seems to be working well.{nl}Please look at how the other detectors are working.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000217	The Petrifying Frost turns everything into stone. Even spirits.{nl}We, Kupoles, are no exception.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000218	Ah, that's it.{nl}Two of them are broken.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000219	We better ask about the soldiers who created the detectors about them.{nl}I heard the person named Retia is the officer so we may receive some help from her.  
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000220	He is at Verkti Square.{nl}Human matters cannot be resolved by the Kupoles, so we are counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000221	Are you talking about the petrification detector at the Coastal Fortress?{nl}We are already aware of that.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000222	It hasn't arrived yet?{nl}I've already dispatched the soldiers there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000223	I don't have a good feeling about this.{nl}Due to numerous monster attacks here, we don't have additional forces to send.{nl}Can I ask you to follow the guards who were dispatched for the repair?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000224	Maybe they have been attacked at the Coastal Fortress.{nl}But, they are the guards of the kingdom. Their dead bodies should be brought here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000225	The Petrifying Frost is reported frequently at the entrance of the Coastal Fortress,{nl}so I think they will be around there. In case you find some corpses, please collect them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000226	I guess it was too late. Thanks for collecting the corpses.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000227	Please come back after fixing the petrification detector.{nl}I have something to say.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000228	I am counting on you to guide all the spirits to the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000229	Lastly, there's some story that they want to tell to the Revelator.{nl}You will want to know why humans are suffering from this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000230	The rumor that the Petrifying Frost is the sin of the revolt is just a made-up story.{nl}The curse came after the revolt so they may well think so.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000231	No, however. {nl}Everything was their plot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000232	The one who broke it first were the demons, however.{nl}That's the Petrifying Frost... they died and their spirits have become stone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000233	Demon Queen Gesti brought the curse of the petrification on this land,{nl}and the goddesses tried to save the humans. But, the demons asked us whether {nl}we had forgotten not to interfere with each other's matters and...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000234	Wait. This memory is too horrible..{nl}A horrible catastrophe has landed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000235	Like a big disaster that the goddess might abandon to save this petrified place.{nl}The Petrifying Frost... All of that... This is what we must suffer through to save that which we abandoned.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000236	I will try to save the spirits from now on.{nl}Since you fixed all the detectors, we will be able to guide the spirits to eternal rest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000237	We will do our best to guide each and every one of them.{nl}I hope the goddesses bless you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000238	I guess you can't trust me since a demon like me is asking you a favor.{nl}But, look at me closely. It doesn't matter if you laugh at me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000239	I've tried my best to escape for hundreds of years.{nl}But, the curse of the petrification is the power of the Demon Queen. {nl}This endless depression is suffocating me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000240	Even if you escape, you're still a traitor.{nl}You'll be called a "traitor" while at the feet of the colleagues who mocked you...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000241	If you cooperate towards my death, I will definitely remove your curse.{nl}I promise in the name of Giltine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000242	It doesn't matter what happens to my body.{nl}I just want to rest...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000243	The poisonous plant that grows up there would be able to take my life away.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000244	I will pray that a plant that is poisonous to humans brings me eternal rest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000245	Thanks. Now, I will pray for the end of my agonizing life.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000246	So nothing occurs as I expected.{nl}If that's the case... We can't say we are in distress. We just have to rely on the one that we demons want to eliminate.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000247	Please bring the holy water from the one who follows the call of the goddesses.{nl}That sacred power will lead me to death.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000248	I heard the Cleric Master handles the holy water.{nl}I don't know if he's going to give me any.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000249	Are you talking about holy water?{nl}I am sorry, but may I ask you where you are going to use it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000250	There are demons who need the holy water?{nl}I am sorry, but I can't help you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000251	I am not going to be involved in your personal matter.{nl}No matter what the reasons are, I can't help demons' matters as a priest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000252	As a priest, I can't cooperate on the tasks of the demons.{nl}I hope you understand this as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000253	So... that's it.{nl}Maybe, we came to expect something that we shouldn't expect.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000254	The people who I believed to be my colleagues betrayed me. {nl}Then, there is no reason for me to hold on to this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000255	The demon lord has ordered me to collect the spirits of humans that will be dedicated to the god.{nl}That's why we began working on creating the integrator which would collect the spirits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000256	The process was smooth, but I suffered from the Petrifying Frost.{nl}Frozen freak, they said while laughing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000257	That I will be the soure of magic of the integrator.{nl}How did I come to forget this...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000258	You must know by now.{nl}The curse that has been put on the barrier stone... we use it to pull spirits from humans.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000259	The spirits that were pulled will be gathered to the integrator and dedicated to the god.{nl}The god... it is like me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000260	The integrator is being protected by three barrier stones.{nl}Destroy the barrier stones down there and obtain the cores from them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000261	I will cast a spell on you so that you won't get cursed again.{nl}The integrator moves by consuming my vitality so it's easy for me. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000262	The guys who abandoned me and laughed at me can't be called our colleagues.{nl}I will get my revenge by killing them. I will make them regret that they treated me like a source of magic.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000263	Well done. My death is near.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000264	The next barrier stone is up there. {nl}We have to put in great power all at once. Like an explosion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000265	Okay... there was a grave robber among the ones who were sacrificed.{nl}I tried to lead myself into death using a bomb, but it was useless.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000266	We should not forget about the core of the barrier stone.{nl}To avoid being cursed again, I will cast a spell.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000267	How come I never thought about this.{nl}Maybe my loyalty has surpassed the fear of loneliness.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000268	The last barrier stone must be exploding by now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000269	As the monsters were being petrified, their last breaths were also solidified... Throw those against barrier stones.{nl}They will gradually collapse.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000270	The core of the barrier stone is composed of condensed spirits.{nl}We will make orbs by collecting those that would destroy the integrator.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000271	I will put the last of my power into the cores of the barrier stones which you've collected.{nl}Pull out monsters' detonators with this and make an orb.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000272	Of course, I will give you a method to make the orb.{nl}The orb that would destroy the integrator.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000273	And, please fulfill my last wish.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000274	I've handed over the method to make the orb with my power.{nl}It will be easy to make an orb.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000275	Succeeded...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000276	Do you know the meaning of the name Giltine?{nl}Her name means death. The only thing that I can rely on at the moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000277	I once thought that I didn't care what I turn myself into if it was for the demons long ago.{nl}But, only the Petrifying Frost blew to me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000278	I started to slowly harden over hundreds of years.{nl}My name has been erased from everyone's minds.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000279	Even if she doesn't bring me eternal rest, it will be better than now.{nl}I just want to rest...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000280	Death is coming to me.{nl}I feel good.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000281	Yes. That's it. Give it to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000282	Within the keepsakes you've found for me...{nl}There must be some parts that will fix the detector at the Coastal Fortress.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000283	Here it is. {nl}The repair shouldn't be that hard.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000284	The Royal Army was taught that they should be loyal and honorable to the kingdom.{nl}And to be committed to due diligence when engaging in their duties.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000285	You came back a long way.{nl}So these are the parts to fix the petrification detector.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000286	It must have been hard to obtain the parts, but the repair itself shouldn't be that hard.{nl}Let's return.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000287	Pillar
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000288	(It seems like something is written on the pillar.)
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000289	(It seems that some letters are visible, but I can't clearly see them.)
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000290	To be able to read the letters, you must have a piece of the symbol.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000291	{nl}You can obtain the piece of the symbol somewhere in Galeed Plateau.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000292	(Something is written, but is not legible.)
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000293	(It seems that something is written on it, but it can't be read in this condition.)
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000294	That ring was given to me by my mother.{nl}I want to go back home with it, back to where my mother is...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000295	Our house is in the inner castle district...{nl}Please... I want to go back home with the ring...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000296	Yes. Gailus Legwyn is my old friend...{nl}But even an old friend shouldn't just take a precious object and not return it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000297	If her father is dead, then she should pay for the debt!{nl}Besides, I didn't even see that lady named Justina.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000298	I don't care who she is. It doesn't matter as long as she brings back my object.{nl}I don't care if that woman really is his daughter or not.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000299	I'm not doing any more trades.{nl}Why do I have to experience this kind of shame?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000300	I want to see Justina...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000301	I feel like I age a hundred years whenever I deal with Pardoners.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000302	If I can get back what's mine, I won't return to this place.{nl}His daughter is a successful woman, so she can take care of it.{nl}You better not get involved with these guys.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000304	This place is a military strategic point and it is also a dangerous area.{nl}You should be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000305	It is hard to maintain the army after the supplies stopped coming from the lower land.{nl}The problem is that the circumstances down there are more severe.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000306	We better do our duty fast...{nl}We just have to hang tight a little longer...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000307	I am not sure how to return to the army.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000308	Soldier Baskez
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000309	It will be our end if we sleep here.{nl}We better move our unit a little bit.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000310	We are going to freeze to death instead of dying from hunger.{nl}Are there any better options?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000311	Thank you so much for saving me last time.{nl}I want to help you, but I am tied to the army...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000312	This place is too cold.{nl}You can clearly see that I can't even move my neck an inch.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000314	I have an important duty to do, but those guys are troubling me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000315	Mesafasla is suffering because of the monsters, though this place is also harsh.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000316	I was able to return to the army because of you. Thanks.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000317	I don't know why I volunteered myself to be a military courier.{nl}My tasks are becoming harder ever since the monsters went crazy.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000318	Supply Officer Ronda
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000319	Supplies are running out, but we still have many people.{nl}You know, I actually rather wish that they would all run away.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000320	We get some supplies from hunting the monsters nearby... It's not enough, though...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000321	There are some potatoes that are growing at Skaika Supply Route.{nl}It's not hard to pick them up...{nl}

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000323	I feel embarassed to have asked you this...{nl}I'm sorry, but I don't have any other choice.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000324	I won't have any strength to fight by just eating meat.{nl}Everyone knows it's important to eat a variety of food.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000325	Since this place is colder than other areas, it is important to consume nutritious food.{nl}As a supply officer, I am having a hard time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000326	An outsider is better at going down the mountains.{nl}You will either freeze to death or die from hunger.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000327	Although the kingdom has become famous, we are still soldiers.{nl}This is a military zone. Please leave if you are not an official.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000328	I heard that this place was used as a workshop.{nl}We are able to find old materials easily, but the problem is the food shortage.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000329	I am worried since the number of my men who are running away is increasing.{nl}Our supplies will last longer, but I am worried that I may become the only one left.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000337	If he didn't have a firm control over the workshop's warehouse, we wouldn't have suffered so much.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000684	Of course I won!{nl}But, I dropped his necklace into the sea which I've received as an evidence.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000685	Back then, I gave up since the sea was too deep...{nl}But I would be able to find it now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000686	If I can find it, I think I will be able to deal a blow to those who says I am a bluff.{nl}It is nearby Kranto Coast. {nl}You are a Corsair who is acknowledged by me, so you will be able to find it quickly.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000691	If you are a Doppelsoeldner, there is a task that you should do for the kingdom.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000694	The last contact was from Fasika Plateau.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000695	That's so unfortunate. They've probably been attacked by the demons.{nl}You have all my support since you became an important member of the Doppelsoeldner.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000696	Ah, please keep this a secret to the others.{nl}I will find another way to contact General Ramin.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000702	First, I need you to get me the materials, so I can prepare it.{nl}I will write down the necessary materials and the locations to get those materials.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000703	This will be enough.{nl}We were able to finish this quickly because of your help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000704	It will take some time before we can extract the substances...{nl}In the meantime, I will teach you alchemy.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000707	The Scout Master and I used be the best friends.{nl}However, our relationship now is not as close as it used to be.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000708	In an effort to become closer, I want to give a present...{nl}I want to give something that the Scout Master likes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000709	Are you prepared for what I am going to request of you?

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000711	But, what if the monsters die...{nl}Unfavorable flavors may get mixed unless you pull them out when they are alive.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000712	To give you a hint, you better catch someone from behind.{nl}Understood?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000713	You've collected enough of them as expected.{nl}By fulfilling this request, I can tell that you won't have a problem learning the last skill.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000714	There are many people who have the same level of competence like you...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000715	Well, alright.{nl}Though, you need to understand that this will cost a lot from you, {nl}if you want to learn this at your current level.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000716	I've been searching for the arrows that the first Fletcher Master created from a long time ago.{nl}Those arrows were given to Lydia Schaffen as a present.{nl}I am certain that these arrows contain some sort of special skill.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000717	Recently, I've obtained useful information about the whereabouts of those arrows...{nl}There is a person who is able to identify the true value of those arrows.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000718	So, I've heard that the arrows are at Galeed Plateau.{nl}They were used when facing against some violent monster, so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000719	Oh. I've only seen it for a short period of time, but I can tell how amazing it is.{nl}I want to do a research on this arrow immediately, {nl}but I've made a promise with you, so that's the first thing I'm going to do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000720	Okay... Let's get started.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000721	As a Falconer Master, I am always looking at different options to make Falconers stronger.{nl}Recently, I've been thinking how I can make those flying monsters of use to us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000722	Of course I am satisfied with my partner, Rith..{nl}I think these attempts are helpful to Falconers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000723	When we tame a hawk, maybe we should feed it something?{nl}I don't have high expectations, but we better go there and try it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000724	I've placed some food for you to try it on at least three different types of monsters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000725	Did we fail... {nl}I expected it though.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000726	Regardless of the result, I should reward you for your effort.{nl}The biggest reward I can give to you would be teaching you new skills.{nl}What do you think?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000727	Shoot at an enemy and hit it...{nl}That's one of the basics of a Schwarzer Reiter.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000728	So you want to learn new skills, huh? {nl}Hitting an enemy with our eyes closed? How does that sound?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000729	Hahaha. However, we aren't blind. {nl}We shouldn't go that far, right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000730	I'm liking your confidence!{nl}I like it so much that we're going to put it to the test.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000731	Your objective is to consecutively hit the targets with an accurate aim.{nl}If you are able to do that, I will acknowledge your skills.{nl}So... I'd say about 200 times? Hm, I think that's too easy for you?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000732	I knew it wasn't a bluff! It was the confidence, am I right?!{nl}As promised, I will gladly become your teacher.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000733	The way of a true Monk...{nl}One should push oneself to extreme limits and endure the harsh training.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000734	If you are willing to take the challenge, then we will start immediately.{nl}Talk to me once you are ready for it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000735	Hurry up and stop talking to me!{nl}If you don't defeat enough enemies within the time limit, I will count again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000736	Very good.{nl}Now is the time for you to learn something from me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000737	I know that you are ready to be a good Pardoner...{nl}But I'm kind of in big trouble.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000738	Well, those impious monsters ripped off the book of offerings.{nl}Because of that, I can't proceed with my other tasks.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000739	I will tell you the location if you can get me that preliminary book.{nl}I think of you as a trustworthy person since we are close...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000740	The preliminary book is at Elkosh Abbey Hospital.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000741	In order to prevent someone from taking them, I've hidden them in the books...{nl}And I've prepared several fake books, so I want you to find them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000742	This is correct place.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000743	Welcome.{nl}I am looking for someone who is willing to help me with my research.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000744	Four years have passed after Medzio Diena...{nl}The aftermath of this disaster hasn't gone down, but it's getting bigger instead.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000745	Especially the plants that have grown so big turned into monsters and dealt a lot of damage.{nl}I am continuously doing research to resolve this issue.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000746	If you can help me with my research, I will teach you the next level of the Druid.{nl}I believe this will be an adequate assignment for you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000747	Please get me samples from the plants who have turned into monsters.{nl}You can obtain more samples the stronger the monster is.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000748	I know that my request was not easy to complete, but you've done it!{nl}These samples that you have brought me are excellent and are helpful in my research.{nl}As promised, I will help you since you helped me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000749	I know what business you have with me...{nl}That aside, we have something more important going on right now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000750	Suddenly, evil energy has become stronger in the place I used to look at with divine power.{nl}Using Clairvoyance doesn't even work anymore for me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000751	I'm asking you if you could get rid of the evil energy that's lurking there?{nl}If you do, I promise you that I will help you reach the next level.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000752	The location is Galeed Plateau.{nl}Please put the Purification of Namott that I gave you to the area where the evil energy is strong. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000753	I knew you were the right person to do this.{nl}As promised, I will lead you to the next level of the Oracle.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000754	Good. Let's get started right away.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000755	You need to fight the monsters until the time limit expires.{nl}As you defeat stronger monsters, I will acknowledge that you've went through hard training..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000756	If you don't defeat them within the time limit, you start from scratch. {nl}Be cautious.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000757	Dragoon Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000758	A Dragoon should never move too far away from an enemy when in danger.{nl}The Dragoon needs to have the courage to fight harder, better, faster and stronger.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000759	We reject the courage of those who fight without skills.{nl}The path of the Dragoon is a difficult path.{nl}So if you've came here without a strong determination, I suggest you leave now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000760	Alright, let's see if you really are worthy enough to become one of us.{nl}Show me your skills.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000761	Your objective is to battle monsters and embrace the pain. Do not move away from them.{nl}That's the determination of a courageous Dragoon. {nl}So, attack and defeat the monsters even if you take damage from them. {nl}Good luck.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000762	What's this? We don't want anyone with a careless mind.{nl}Since I like you, I am giving you another chance. {nl}Come on, show me your courage and your skills!
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000763	Excellent. You did good.{nl}From this day forward, I will acknowledge you as a member of the Dragoons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000764	Are you interested in becoming a Templar?{nl}I can already tell that you are very smart for making this choice.{nl}Now, let me give you a walkthrough of what you need to be aware of.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000765	A Templar is a leader to many people. We need people with strong leadership skills.{nl}Especially during these times, a Templar's leadership is most likely required.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000766	Don't get me wrong, though. This is often misunderstood as 'authority'.{nl}No, I'm leaning more towards 'cooperation'.{nl}You should cooperate with your followers in order to maintain a group.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000767	Do you understand what I am trying to tell you?{nl}With that being said, let's see your skills as a Templar.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000768	A person in authority makes orders, but a Templar should make requests.{nl}Your task is to recruit five people and become their leader in that group.{nl}While being the leader of the group, you have to lead them for quite some time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000769	The fuel that drives people is the respect.{nl}So, to confirm if you possess this charm, I will put you up to the test.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000770	Oh, I absolutely do not like to be deceived by tricks or anything like that.{nl}Recruit five people all by yourself and become the leader of the group.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000771	Well done.{nl}You are certainly much more charming than I expected.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000772	It can be tough to make other people follow you.{nl}The more people following you, the tougher it becomes.{nl}It's not easy, but a Templar with great respect and admiration can pull it off.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000773	I will tell you the things that a Templar must have knowledge in.{nl}I hope you will make wise and careful decisions in the future, so do not forget this.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000774	Warlock Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000775	We will take any measures by any means for the goddesses...{nl}That is the strict rule that we, Warlocks, must abide by.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000776	There are many people who misunderstand our interpretations.{nl}A Warlock and its evil spirits are not equally contracted.{nl}We have to rule over them and able to control the evil spirits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000777	In order to do so, you need to possess strong magic able to rule and control the evil spirits.{nl}Unless... you want to get eaten up by them. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000778	Since you don't know these evil spirits that well like I do...{nl}I will give you a scroll that will wake them up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000779	Use this scroll on monsters at Valius' Eternal Resting Place to wake up the sleeping evil spirits.{nl}To add another part of this challenge, you need to defeat a monster and the evil spirits.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000780	Get rid of the poison with poison. {nl}Anything else that is evil should be gotten rid of by the evil spirits. {nl}I am waiting for the day when we, the Warlocks, are not needed anymore.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000781	Excellent.{nl}This is much better than I had expected.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000782	From now on, you will tread the path of the Warlock. {nl}Oh, and please remember this...{nl}If you don't stand on top of them, you will be consumed by them...{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000783	Featherfoot Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000784	I don't know how you found out about the curse of the Featherfoot, but...{nl}This curse should not be overused. Rather, it needs some detailed calculations.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000785	Of course, I can teach you if you still want to. However...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000786	Since you don't know anything about the curse, I ask you to take these incantation tools.{nl}I told you that it requires detailed calculations before using the curse.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000787	Find out what there is to lose and what there is to gain...{nl}Use these incantation tools to cast the curse on a monster to find out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000788	If you learn something here, you will become a great Featherfoot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000789	The curse should not be overused, but instead it requires some detailed calculations.{nl}Experience what the magic used by a Featherfoot is like with help of the tools.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000790	Now, do you have a broader understanding of the Featherfoot's curse?{nl}You should not consider it like the curse that is used by Demon Lords like Naktis.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000791	The arrows of the curse shall only be used on the enemies of the goddesses.{nl}For us, that is our most important guideline. Please keep that in mind.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000792	Cannoneer Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000793	You enrolled to become a Cannoneer? Good choice, hotshot.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000794	Listen up! The most important attribute of the Cannoneer is firepower, a lot of it!{nl}If a Cannoneer cannot distinguish between aerial attacks and ground attacks, {nl}he or she isn't a valuable asset to the team!{nl}Enemies that are flying in the air should only be attacked by aerial attacks,{nl}and enemies that are on the ground should only be attacked by ground attacks.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000795	I figured you should know about this if you want to become a skilled Cannoneer, like me.{nl}What about it, hotshot? You interested?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000796	Good! Alright, hotshot. {nl}I can only assume that you will remember what I will teach you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000797	Do you have a paper and pen with you? Remember this.{nl}There are many types of enemies, but the ones that are flying in the air are all aerial-type.{nl}In contrast, the ones that are moving on the ground are considered a walking-type.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000798	Alright, face against monsters with both these types.{nl}You need to understand how each enemy moves and which attacks are effective.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000799	The flying monsters are aerial-types and the ones that move on the ground are walking-types.{nl}Face against both types of monsters. Understood?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000800	Good.{nl}Was this a good lesson? Am I a good teacher?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000801	Alrighty then! Theoretically, you should know all the logic about what I've taught you.{nl}It's time to put the theory into practice!{nl}The skills of a Cannoneer are not easy, so make sure to focus!
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000802	Muskeeteer Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000803	A Muskeeteer should know how to handle a rifle.{nl}Not many enemies can stand against simultaneous firing by well trained Musketeers.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000805	One of the basic aspects of marksmanship is to procure range.{nl}Give it a shot. Attack an enemy at maximum range.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000806	It's not just extending the range, but to extend it up the {nl}maximum distance where you are able to shoot.{nl}I am going to put you to the test to see how well you perform.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000807	It's not just extending the range, but to extend it up the {nl}maximum distance where you are able to shoot.{nl}If you want to become a Musketeer, you will accept my challenge.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000986	It seems as if I am in a daze because of the monster attacks.{nl}I think I discarded invaluable research materials while I was tidying them up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000987	The discarded documents should be gathered at Menka Knoll... Could you look for them?{nl}I can't manage to get there because of the increase in monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000988	I'm sure that you'll be able to find them if you take a close look at the discarded documents there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000989	The documents you need to find is the Research Material List for Alemeth Forest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000990	You can leave the rest of the documents behind.{nl}Please check carefully not to get them mixed up with anything else.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000991	Did you check them carefully?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000992	It seems like you've brought the correct documents.{nl}Go see Sarma after you give me the documents.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000993	I think he's kept an eye on your skills.{nl}I think he wants to ask you something after seeing you help me out.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000994	Sarma
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000995	Ah, greetings.{nl}I assume you've heard of me from Gatre.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000996	I've been keeping a close eye on you since you helped Gatre.{nl}At first I was merely curious of an outsider here, but you seem to be quite talented.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000997	As you may be well aware of, it is hard to do any research because of the monsters.{nl}I think I'll be able to finish my research if you help me out a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000998	It's for the wellbeing of the people here so I beg that you help out.{nl}Of course I shall pay handsomely when the research is finished.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000999	I thank you.{nl}My first request is for you to gather the blood of Green Eldigos.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001000	I need to extract the blood from a live Green Eldigo for my research, but that's no easy task.{nl}I'll give you some Tranquilizer Powder to knock {nl}the Green Eldigos out and bring some blood back.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001001	So, how did it go?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001002	Very good. Excellent.{nl}I think I'd be confident in asking you to do more tasks.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001003	I'll go to the Forest of Prayer Entrance and prepare for the final experiment.{nl}You go and gather the ingredients needed for the last experiment.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001004	Gatre has the list for the ingredients I need for the final experiment so you can get it from him.{nl}I have faith in you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001005	Sarma said that he needed all of the ingredients on the list?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001006	Oh no, it seems as if he's already beginning the final experiment!{nl}We have to find more evidence before it is too late.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001007	It would be strange to not collect the ingredients without proper evidence.{nl}Collect the listed ingredients since you can't we can't risk him suspecting anything.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001008	Why don't we gather some evidence together since Sarma seems to be absent.{nl}I know just what to look for.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001009	There are research notes from a person that used to help Sarma's experiments.{nl}His name was Boldas... and is in a coma because of an unfortunate accident.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001010	Sarma had those notes until he lost them in a monster attack.{nl}Come to think of it, I think Sarma was especially nervous about losing those notes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001011	There may be important information in those notes.{nl}He lost the notes towards the Juice Collection Site, so try searching that area first.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001012	Don't forget the listed ingredients either.{nl}I'll do what Sarma asked in order to avoid suspicion.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001013	Do you have all of the ingredients?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001014	Hmm. There seems to be something missing...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001015	Ah! It seems that it's missing from the list.{nl}I thought I had written everything down, but mistakes where made...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001016	I'm sorry, but could you go get some fermented fruit tree sap from Gatre?{nl}I can't proceed with the experiment without it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001017	Sarma told you that he needed fermented fruit tree sap right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001018	He really has come close to finishing the experiments.{nl}You see, I had removed the sap from the list on purpose.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001019	By the way, how does Sarma's research seem to you?{nl}Did you find anything suspicious in the research notes?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001020	I think that's a good idea.{nl}We might be able to find some clues as to what Sarma is really up to.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001021	That was written in the notes?{nl}I'll need to take a look at the notes myself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001022	Oh my...{nl}If these notes are true, then Sarma definitely has other plans for his research.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001023	But the matter still stands that we don't have any actual proof.{nl}I'll look for some solid evidence if you can manage to stall the experiments a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001024	Take something that is similar to the sap in order to ruin Sarma's experiment.{nl}Meanwhile, I'll check all of his research documents.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001025	I'll give you this tree sap.{nl}All you have to do is to go to the Research Material Warehouse {nl}and find something that looks similar to this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001026	He has to mix all the ingredients before commencing the last stage anyways.{nl}So he won't be able to tell them apart as long as they look similar.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001027	Is this water from... near Pelke Shrine Ruins?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001028	I've heard that something bad happened there...{nl}Well, I suppose it will be alright.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001029	Take this to Sarma since they look almost identical at a glance.{nl}I'll take a peek at his research documents and try to find out his true purpose.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001030	Be careful just in case.{nl}I'll get to you as soon as I find something.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001031	What took you so long in bringing me one more ingredient?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001032	Well, it seems as if you've brought the proper ingredient.{nl}This is the last stage of the experiment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001033	Now all that is left is to but this on the Transmutation Magic Circle and inserting magic.{nl}I've set it so that anyone can power it with magic, so you should have no trouble. {nl}Now go and power the magic circle.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001034	T-That's... because I have other things to do.{nl}I have to leave records of the experiment and observe the situation you see.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001035	Now stop stalling and go power up the Transmutation Magic Circle.{nl}All you have to do is put the ingredients on the circle {nl}and emancipate the magic from the tombstone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001036	But remember that the magic in the tombstone can only be emancipated from the front.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001037	Has the liquid properly been created?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001038	Ahah.{nl}It seems that I finally have results for this research.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001039	Now all I have to do is check to see if the liquid has the intended effect.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001040	Thanks to you, I've been able to get the research, which had been progressing slowly, this far.{nl}With this, we'll be able to restore the enlargened fruit trees back to normal.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001041	How about you spray the liquid onto the trees yourself since you've helped me so far.{nl}If properly made, it will make the trees go back to their original states.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001042	Here, I'll give you some of the liquid.{nl}We'll be able to see if it has any effect immediately.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001043	Try spraying it on the Pile of Leaves just ahead of you.{nl}You'll be able to see something quite interesting.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001044	I'm sorry.{nl}I wasn't able to catch Sarma.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001045	Thankfully, the liquid wasn't created as Sarma planned.{nl}Even though he seems to think that it is perfect.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001046	Sarma's original plan was to create monsters that he could command.{nl}Thankfully, they don't seem to listen to him since we switched the ingredients a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001047	I'll go looking for Sarma.{nl}Even though the liquid is a failure, it's still quite dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001048	I hope that the hidden items will be found and used by whomever sees this inside the pot.{nl}There is another pot at the Old Camp that shows the location of the hidden items.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001049	Monster attacks have been too frequent lately.{nl}That's why Sarma's research is being delayed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001050	Don't forget to read the last part of the instruction manual.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001051	It will be hard to find the documents at Menka Knoll if you don't read them carefully.{nl}There's a lot of documents that are actually being disposed there as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001052	I've put my whole life's achievements on restoring Alemeth Forest to its original state.{nl}This research must succeed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001053	Anyone would be upset about losing their notes.{nl}But Sarma... seemed to be much more than upset at the loss.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001054	The contents of those notes might prove to be important evidence.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001055	If you do get caught, just say that it was a simple mistake.{nl}The important thing is to buy us some more time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001056	First, help Sarma with his experiments.{nl}I'll try to find some evidence in the meantime.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001057	The magic from the tombstone must be emancipated from the front.{nl}The front is the side with the letters on it, so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001058	It is finally time for my research to come to fruitation...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001059	I had merely panicked a bit because of the sudden attack.{nl}I am not frightened of such monsters!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001060	I am conducting research in order to restore the forest to its original state.{nl}Those fruits are inedible you see...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001061	It was hard getting a chance to talk to you because of Sarma.{nl}Now, I can tell you everything since he's gone.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001062	I can't believe he was researching how to control monsters...{nl}I'm having a hard time believing how a person could even {nl}think of doing so even after witnessing it with my two eyes.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001063	They've all left because of the fruits that are inedible no matter how large they are.{nl}But how could you turn your back on your hometown?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001064	What do you think the real purpose for Sarma's research?{nl}I just hope that I'm worrying over nothing...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001065	The villagers all believed in Sarma and his research...{nl}How could he do such a thing?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001066	You're an outsider that I haven't seen before.{nl}I don't know what you're doing here, but please don't interrupt my research.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001067	Everything is going as planned except for those monsters.{nl}They're hindering my research so much that it's become more than a mere nuisance.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001068	I wish to show you the research once it is complete.{nl}Of course I will show it to Gatre who's been helping me all along as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001069	At last, the day that my research reaches fruitation has come...{nl}It is a relief that I was able to receive help from someone as able as you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001070	Necromancer Lemija
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001071	Adomas is late...{nl}Where could he be?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001072	Where have Adomas and Faustas gone to when we have so much to do...{nl}Have you seen any Necromancers around here by any chance?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001073	It would have been hard even if we all worked together...{nl}But now, doing so is impossible.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001074	That lord lieutenant... He deserves to be attacked by monsters just like them.{nl}I'm only holding back because the mayor is too.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001075	The goddesses are so merciless...{nl}I had only started to collect coral after giving up fishing for a living...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001076	I think everyone is shocked by the lord lieutenant.{nl}Well... At least I'm glad that things turned out alright in the end.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001077	Just look at them.{nl}They were attacked by monsters trying to gather tributes...{nl}It's just so wrong.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001078	I'll be fine as long as I get some proper rest thanks to the first aid.{nl}You've been a great help.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001079	It's just pathetic.{nl}We don't even have basic amenities, but we're worrying about making tributes...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001080	That lord lieutenant will bring the wrath of the goddesses upon himself soon enough.{nl}He not only tried to get more tributes for himself, but also disgraced the lord.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001081	There is nothing more important to a merchant than credibility.{nl}I need to acquire the necessary coral in time... but it seems like I'm in trouble.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001082	I've heard. You've dealt with the terrifying monster that the lord lieutenant summoned.{nl}I wish that someone like you was in our merchant alliance.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001083	Don't stray too far from here if you can help it.{nl}The monster density increases so much that it's too dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001084	I never even thought that my colleagues were also in league with the lord lieutenant...{nl}I'm still numb when I think of all those years we've served together.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001085	Please stay here where it's safe if possible.{nl}There's no way for us to help if you stray too far away from here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001086	We're going to transport that lord lieutenant to the lord soon.{nl}I doubt that he'll get off easy...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001087	Please refrain from going too far away because there has been an increase of monsters.{nl}We won't be able to guarantee your safety due to our orders.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001088	An outsider helped out with something that we should have done ourselves...{nl}This is shameful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001089	Do you think I won't do anything after all of this humility? Wait and see. {nl}I'll show the merchant alliance and the refugees here who gets the last laugh some day!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001090	This guy, he still seem to be delusional.{nl}Does he really not know what situation he is in?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001091	It's all gone upside down because of that lord lieutenant and a few soldiers.{nl}I'm certain that they'll make inquiries into us as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001092	Merchant Alliance Worker
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001093	It was nice having a bit of a rest, but we weren't quite at ease either.{nl}I guess we can finally go to the customers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001094	I haven't been working here long, but that is a sight to behold.{nl}An ocean without any water... I've never seen anything like it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001095	I've heard that coral is really popular.{nl}I think it's said to be used in very expensive medicines... {nl}How much do you think it will cost?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001096	I guess anything can happen when the world is in such disarray.{nl}He's lucky the people here are gentle, he'd be thoroughly beaten if it was back where I'm from.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001097	What's going on?{nl}There are people willing to work and soldiers to protect them, {nl}yet we can't get the coral because of monsters?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001098	This used to be the bottom of the sea, but they say {nl}that all the water was drained after Medzio Diena.{nl}It's quite a sight don't you think?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001099	It's chilling to think that the lord lieutenant was the reason we weren't able to gather coral.{nl}I'm glad it's over now. All well that ends well as they say.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001100	People like us have never even held a sword before, so all we can do is to envy your skills.{nl}Isn't it impressive that our leader found out that it {nl}was the lord lieutenant who was behind all of this?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001101	It's a shame about what happened to Faustas... But his crimes cannot be forgiven.{nl}He murdered... he murdered Adomas.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001102	I'm planning on carrying out the rest of the mission.{nl}I'll have to tell the master about what happened... But I don't feel too comfortable.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001103	Search for the Monk
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001104	It seems as if returning to the annex is out of the question.{nl}Look for the monk that's trapped in the principal building.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001105	You have found a labeled reagent bottle in a pile of leaves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001106	Base reagent. Nahash Sample.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001107	{nl}Look for the reagent's owner.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001108	A tent that appears to have been attacked by monsters... Check to see what happened?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001109	Missing Lucienne
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001110	Lucienne is missing!{nl}It seems as if she has gone to the Ownerless Reclaimed Land to use the reagent.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001111	Searching past the Wall
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001112	It seems as if only Dominikas can pass through the black wall.{nl}Dominikas seems to be hiding something beyond the wall and lying about it.{nl}Search past the wall.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001113	Elgos Monk
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001114	I'm so... hungry...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001115	Starved
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001116	It seems as if there is nothing more to eat.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001117	Lucienne Winterspoon
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001118	Thank you so much for saving me!{nl}Whew, I was in a tight spot with my tent being attacked and all.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001119	Oh, my name is Lucienne Winterspoon by the way.{nl}I am a member of the Winterspoon family which is renown for its alchemy prowess.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001120	Vaidotas. You know him right?{nl}Alchemist Master Vaidotas is my older cousin.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001121	Have you heard that Vaidotas was kidnapped by the Vubbes?{nl}I mean, he's the Alchemist Master... {nl}I think I was more ashamed of the kidnapping than he was.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001122	That's why I've decided that I should take his place.{nl}It's obvious that I'm more suitable for the position don't you think?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001123	The family elders are holding me back though.{nl}Would you believe that they're saying that they can't {nl}acknowledge my skill without distinct research results!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001124	That's why I came here.{nl}I'm trying to do some research on why the regions near Nahash Forest{nl}received less damage than other places on Medzio Diena.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001125	But I've been unable to make much headway because there are so many monsters.{nl}It turns out that the only reason it was damaged less is because the baserock is more solid.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001126	Then I discovered something amazing in Nahash Forest!{nl}There was an enormous plant rooted to the Ownerless Reclaimed Land, you see.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001127	I thought it was perfect for my experiments because it wouldn't react to most substances.{nl}Think about it! Making a reagent that can get rid of such a large plant.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001128	I'll be able to restore damaged regions like Orsha or the Thorn Forest back to normal...{nl}It might even open a path to being able to prevent a second Medzio Diena from happening.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001129	Don't you think that the family elders will also acknowledge me as well?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001130	The problem is that the over abundant monster population is hindering my research.{nl}There should be less monsters if I could get to Pamesti Village...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001131	Of course. You seemed to be quite skilled back there...{nl}I'm sorry, but could you get me to Pamesti Village?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001132	I promise I won't forget you if you help me out this time after I become the Alchemist Master!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001133	Thanks! You've brought me to the village safely.{nl}Now I have to get ready for the experiments again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001134	...Oh! Whoops!{nl}I must have dropped my base reagent somewhere {nl}while I was running away from the testing tent...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001135	I can't do any more experiments without it, what a stupid mistake.{nl}What should I do...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001136	Yes! That's it!{nl}How on earth did you get a hold of it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001137	Oh... I must have dropped it in the tent I was conducting experiments in.{nl}It's a relief to have it back. Thank you so much. You're absolutely the best!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001138	Now I have to collect the remaining ingredients.{nl}I can get most of the herbs on my own, but I don't think I can take on the Blue Spion by myself...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001139	So do you think that you could get some Spion Tree Leaves for me?{nl}I'll try to gather the other herbs in the meantime.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001140	Thanks a lot.{nl}Let's meet up back here once we've each gathered the ingredients.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001141	You're back earlier than I expected.{nl}I hope you didn't have too hard a time dealing with the Blue Spion.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001142	Now all I have to do is to mix the reagent with these ingredients.{nl}The only problem is that the monsters seem to be attracted to the smell of the reagent.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001143	Could you deal with any monsters that happen to come near me while I mix the reagent?{nl}So that I can focus entirely on mixing the reagent.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001144	It's finally finished! Thank you so much. {nl}I couldn't have dreamed of finishing the reagent without your help!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001145	Now all that's left is to test the reagent.{nl}Luckily, I've seen an appropriate branch near the Herb Broker Tent.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001146	Tree vines don't usually grow in Nahash Forest, but that place seems to be the exception.{nl}Strange isn't it? It almost seems like someone is raising them there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001147	It just doesn't seem right just like that enormous plant.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001148	Well whatever the case, that tree vine seems to be perfect to test the reagent on.{nl}How about doing the last experiment together since we've crafted the reagent together? 
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001149	Did you see that? The vine grew and then crumbled!{nl}It's a success! Our reagent actually worked!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001150	I can't believe that I completed a reagent without the help of Vaidotas...{nl}I'm so happy. The next Alchemist Master will be me when I show the family this reagent!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001151	So. Let's go the the Ownerless Reclaimed Land. {nl}I'm sure that we'll be able to get rid of the enormous {nl}plant there and stop the plants from expanding further.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001152	Alchemist Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001153	Lucienne Winterspoon...{nl}May I ask how you came to learn of the name of that troublemaker?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001154	What? You've brought me a reagent that she made in Nahash Forest?{nl}Please give that to me. What has she concocted up this time...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001155	...Oh dear. {nl}Did you perhaps test this reagent? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001156	This reagent accelerates plant growth.{nl}The plant will crumble if it doesn't have the strength to withstand it but if it does...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001157	We don't have time for this.{nl}Knowing Lucienne, she might have already gone to use the reagent somewhere.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001158	I'll give you this counteragent. Please hurry and give this to Lucienne.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001159	What took you so long?{nl}You said you'd ask Vaidotas didn't you?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001160	Having a healthy amount of scholarly ambition is something to be commemorated.{nl}But passion past her skills is not good for Lucienne.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001161	...Okay. I guess I was wrong this time.{nl}Something bad could have happened without Vaidotas' help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001162	That doesn't mean that I've lost to Vaidotas though!{nl}Don't you know that failure is the mother of success?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001163	I've failed miserably this time so I'm going to get a great breakthrough soon!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001164	There's no time for this.{nl}I think I can do the rest of the experiments by myself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001165	Farewell then. I thank you for all the help you've given me. {nl}I never forget my debts, so I will repay it one day by helping you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001166	No... Wait...{nl}Why is Vaidotas being brought up in this?!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001167	It's me who succeeded in the experiment, so why should Vaidotas get to see this?{nl}I've mixed this reagent, so why should Vaidotas...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001168	Is it because the vine we tested it on grew a bit?{nl}What does that have to do with anything. It's gone thanks to my reagent!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001169	...If it bothers you that much, you go by yourself.{nl}I don't want to go. Do as you please.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001170	Even though it's a bit infuriating, but Vaidotas took {nl}a look at my reagent's ingredients and mix ratio.{nl}It seems that I should have used Spion Teeth instead of the leaves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001171	I can get the rest of the materials, but Spions are still to much for me...{nl}Could you get me some Spion Teeth?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001172	Well... It would be nice if this mix ratio succeeds..{nl}It will mean that Vaidotas is wrong if it fails so...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001173	It would seem rude to not proceed with the experiment when he's being so considerate...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001174	Thanks. {nl}I'm going to humiliate Vaidotas after succeeding and improving the reagent!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001175	Are you planning on going elsewhere?{nl}Hm... Well then...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001176	I took a look at the soil from a farm on the Ownerless Reclaimed Land, and it was superb.{nl}I think that if I plant some experimental herbs there, they'll do well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001177	I'll give you the herb seeds. {nl}Could you plant them if you happen to pass by the Ownerless Reclaimed Land?{nl}Come on, you can help me out that much more can't you?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001178	I wouldn't have been able to get this far with the research without you.{nl}Even though I don't want to admit it, V... Vaidotas helped as well...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001179	Villager Nella
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001180	Thank you for saving us at the monastery.{nl}I don't know what would have happened to us with that swindler if it wasn't for you...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001181	Still, the swindler's incantation seems to be having a bit of an effect.{nl}We haven't been attacked by monsters for a while.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001182	Well, that doesn't mean that we can live in harmony with the monsters.{nl}We don't know when we'll be attacked by monsters because the incantation wears off either.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001183	Could you help deal with the monsters near the town?{nl}It'll be much safer if you could help out a little.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001184	The village has been totally destroyed while we were at the monastery.{nl}Well this... I suppose it was our own fault getting tricked like that.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001185	Thank you.{nl}Oh, I don't think you'll have to worry about the rest of the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001186	Lucienne Winterspoon said that she'll craft us monster repellant while she stays here.{nl}I hope you'll stay safe on your travels.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001187	Welcome. Brother.{nl}Have you come to be redeemed by us of the Tree of Truth?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001188	If so, welcome.{nl}I was just educating the believers of our creed.{nl}How about you join us for a moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001189	Good. {nl}Now, I shall begin the sermon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001190	Oh yes... It might be a bit dizzy at first.{nl}That is all part of the process in receiving the Divine Tree's blessing.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001191	How was your first sermon about the creed? {nl}Was it alright?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001192	Good, good.{nl}I welcome you once more.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001193	Although the Divine Tree is benevolent, redemption does not come for free.{nl}You must labor for the chance to be redeemed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001194	Helping other believers might be a good place to start since you are new.{nl}I hope to see you soon.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001195	Greetings. Brother.{nl}Have you received the Demon Soul Orb from Dominikas?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001196	The demons will not attack you on sight if you hold an orb filled with their souls.{nl}It seems as if you have yet to receive the orb from Dominikas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001197	I have an extra Soul Orb.{nl}But... you'll have to fill it with demon souls yourself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001198	Still, you won't have to worry about demons attacking you once it's filled with demon souls.{nl}The benevolent Divine Tree shall protect you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001199	I've learned that although demons are our enemies, they are also to be redeemed just like us.{nl}We will all become one in the blessings of the Divine Tree.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001200	I see you've filled the orb.{nl}How was it? I assume the demons didn't attack you on the way back?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001201	What? You were attacked?{nl}That's strange. It is most likely due to your lack of faith.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001202	Ah, look at the time...{nl}Pardon me, I must prepare to attend an important ritual.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001203	Welcome. You're the newcomer, right?{nl}I am selecting scriptures here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001204	To us, the goddesses are immoral as only the Divine Tree can offer true redemption.{nl}We no longer need the old scriptures that worship the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001205	What do we do with the useless scriptures?{nl}We usually gather them and burn them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001206	Thank you for saving me!{nl}Of course, this is all because of the blessing of the Divine Tree.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001207	Why do you think the demons attacked us?{nl}That is strange... This has never happened before.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001208	Farewell then... I need to attend a ritual.{nl}Make sure you're not late either, brother. I will see you later.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001209	Villager James
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001210	Oh, so you are the newcomer.{nl}It's a pleasure to meet you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001211	I am purifying the corrupted power of the goddess with the red blood of the demons. {nl}However, it seems that I've run out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001212	Normally Dominikas gets it for me but he seems to be busy at the moment.{nl}Not to mention the fact that we are currently under {nl}their protection so we can't attack them either.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001213	That's why I want you to go get some red demon blood.{nl}As a recruit you can do this much, no?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001214	Thank you.{nl}Demon blood has the special power so it can purify the corrupted power of the goddess.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001215	Look around you, all of this was the result of my purification.{nl}How about it, beautiful isn't it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001216	Well it's about time I leave.{nl}You're free to wander the monastery but try not to go near {nl}the black wall in the Annex Laboratory up there.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001217	That wall is full of holy energy so that only those chosen {nl}by the Divine Tree such as Dominikas can go there.{nl}Well then, see you later.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001218	...How did you get in here?{nl}This is a sacred place that only those who are chosen by the Divine Tree may enter.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001219	Oh my, it appears that the Divine Tree has already chosen you.{nl}I knew you were something special the moment I laid my eyes upon you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001220	To think that you were chosen the moment you joined, this is quite an amazing turn of events.{nl}There is a very important ritual coming up... a ritual to bestow the Divine Tree's blessings.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001221	All the other followers are waiting at the passage that leads to the annex.{nl}Although I must go ahead in order to prepare for the ritual, please take your time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001222	Hurry and deliver this.{nl}I can no longer stand to see the power of the goddess being corrupted.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001223	I feel an evil presence coming from the vines that Dominikas left behind.{nl}To think that our monastery might have been covered in such a thing, how frightening.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001224	Is there any way to get rid of those vines?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001225	Hmm...You say that you need a particular reagent to get rid of the vines?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001226	You've arrived at just the right time.{nl}The reagent that Vaidotas was working on is done.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001227	Here!{nl}I'll call it "Lucienne's Special Reagent"!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001228	...What's wrong?{nl}It's real this time! I made sure it's safe this time!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001229	Even if you can't trust me you should trust Vaidotas!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001230	Welcome back.{nl}Please hurry, I don't want to look at the terrible vines any longer.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001231	That's Winterspoon for you!{nl}It's almost like that vine was never there, thank you so much, Revelator!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001232	Sorry for making you help us so much...{nl}We owe you our sincere thanks.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001233	I am talking about the scripture from the Tree of Truth sect left by Dominikas.{nl}It turns out that impious thing still remain in the monastery.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001234	If you see the fake scripture, could you bring it to me?{nl}We're too short-handed to spare anyone at the moment...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001235	Those at the Tree of Truth sect... corrupted the power of the goddess...{nl}This is just blasphemy to the goddess!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001236	So you've found the fake scripture. Thank you.{nl}Give it to me and I will take care of it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001237	S...Stop!{nl}I will do whatever you ask me, so please stop!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001238	Should I just join the Tree of Truth sect?{nl}If I did, would I be able to escape this hunger?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001239	Lies...{nl}If not... How... The black wall...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001240	It seems that he's been undernourished for a long time.{nl}I can't talk to him now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001241	Thank you so much...{nl}I am so sorry for misunderstanding you. I thought something was going wrong...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001242	After I regained my consciousness, I felt this mysterious energy from you.{nl}What happened?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001243	Ah... So you're the Revelator.{nl}I guess this is why the black wall couldn't block you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001244	Thank you. I was able to survive because of you.{nl}Dominikas... He's more cruel than the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001245	It hasn't been a long time since Dominikas visited the Elgos Monastery.{nl}I thought he was just an accompanying monk.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001246	Not so long after he came here, the tree vines and the {nl}demons suddenly swept the monastery annex.{nl}The villagers fled there... But, he stopped them appropriately.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001247	When I think about it, it was all a facade.{nl}The raid of the tree vines and the sudden attacks of the demons...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001248	As the villagers started to follow him, he quickly showed his true nature.{nl}He asked us to create a sinister idol and believe in the Divine Tree.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001249	Of course, we resisted... But he locked us into that black wall.{nl}He gave us just enough water to stay alive and tried to convert us to his religion.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001250	I felt so painful since I didn't know what to do.{nl}Ah... The abbot!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001251	The abbot must be locked inside the monastery.{nl}I was hoping that the goddesses would protect us... {nl}But we will be in trouble if we don't quickly give you the food.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001252	Elgos Abbot
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001253	This energy... Yes, it's you. The Revelator.{nl}It seems the goddess finally answered my prayer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001254	Ah, nothing. If the other monks are alright, the food will be okay...{nl}I don't think I'll be able to swallow the food.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001255	He's too old... Is he going to be alright...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001256	As expected, Revelator, you're not blocked by the black wall.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001257	The sinister idol that was created by Dominikas in front of Pagarba Chapel...{nl}The black wall started to cover the monastery because of that idol.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001258	If we destroy that sinister idol...{nl}There might be a good chance that the whole wall may disappear.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001259	I just don't know how I can destroy it...{nl}There is nothing I can think of at the moment.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001260	No, wait...{nl}I can sense the demons' souls from you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001261	That sphere you have...{nl}Is a demon's soul locked inside it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001262	That's it.{nl}Maybe we can use this to destroy the sinister idol.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001263	The idea is to purify the demons' souls and use their power.{nl}Unfortunately, we lack the right amount of souls to destroy the idol.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001264	Can you fill it with a little bit more of the demons' souls?{nl}As you already may know, defeating demons will automatically absorb their souls.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001265	The demons are strong so... I guess that their souls are strong as well.{nl}My sacred energy is not strong enough to purify this much power.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001266	We should somehow borrow the power of holy water...{nl}Like I told you before though, I have nothing at the moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001267	I am so sorry, but can you get me Holy Water from the Priest Master in Klaipeda?{nl}If we have enough holy water, we'll be able to purify the demons' fallen souls.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001268	Please use the statue of Goddess Vakarine near Viyme Fountain.{nl}You can quickly come back from Klaipeda.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001269	With this, you'll be able to purify the souls contained within the Soul Sphere.{nl}Now, give me a moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001270	Since the power of a demon's soul is strong, the residual power after purification possesses strength as well.{nl}This power has the capability to destroy the sinister idol.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001271	Put the purified Soul Sphere's power into the sinister idol.{nl}I hope the idol can't endure this...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001272	Finally!{nl}Now, we can be freed from the black wall.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001273	It's been such a long time...{nl}I think my prayer to the goddess was not in vain...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001274	Now, we'll need to focus on the main culprit of the Tree of Truth sect, Dominikas...{nl}Everything will be over once we drive him out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001275	Please lend me your power a little longer.{nl}Even if we have the methods to catch him, we can't use our powers {nl}since the villagers have been possessed from being tortured so long...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001276	He seems to have some sort of power that allows him to control plants.{nl}I have to warn you because he is not to be underestimated.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001277	Dominikas... He ran away...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001278	We shouldn't worry too much.{nl}It's a big blow that we drove out the Tree of Truth sect from the Elgos Monastery.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001279	And the monsters instead of plants' explosion, I guess it stopped since the spell was unstable.{nl}We were able to protect the villagers because of you.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001280	When we get better, we will clean up the monastery.{nl}Of course, we should drive out the demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001281	Even if the world collapses, we believe in you...{nl}You give us the power to endure.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001282	I don't want to imagine what would have happened without you...{nl}On behalf of the whole monastery, we greatly appreciate your help
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001283	You've done it!{nl}The black wall disappeared...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001284	Thank you for saving the monastery.{nl}Ah, is the abbot alright?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001285	...So that is it. {nl}Your faith is as strong as I imagined.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001286	Good! Anything. {nl}Just tell me what I can do for you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001287	What? {nl}So the villagers think we ran away after abandoning the monastery?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001288	Those people at the Tree of Truth sect... {nl}They locked others inside and alienated them...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001289	Can you go to the villagers with me?{nl}If you are with me, all misunderstandings will be solved.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001290	Hmm... It seems that the villagers found out the true identity of Dominikas.{nl}It is fortunate that the task was solved easier than expected...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001291	I will send the villagers back to the village.{nl}I really appreciate that you've reclaimed the Elgos Monastery from the Tree of Truth sect.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001292	The demons here are very strong. {nl}Be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001293	Don't underestimate the power of the sinister idol.{nl}Be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001294	Now, the Revelator will continue the journey by following the will of the goddess.{nl}But before you leave, can you do me one more favor for this old man?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001295	Although I got rid of the Tree of Truth sect...{nl}The evil demons still prevail.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001296	If you lend me your power, we'll be able to drive out the demons much faster.{nl}Can you defeat the demons here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001297	There is something that is bothering me.{nl}I think driving out the Tree of Truth sect was wonderful, but...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001298	Dominikas ran away.{nl}I think he may come back by leading the Tree of Truth sect...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001299	I want to prepare something for this...{nl}Can you help me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001300	If Dominikas comes back again...{nl}Then, I will not stand idly by.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001301	Thank you. {nl}I can relax now because of you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001302	Good. You should do it.{nl}I was actually going to Veyrhas Hall to burn the scripture...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001303	It is better to see it once than to hear it a hundred times.{nl}Let's go together. Brother.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001304	I didn't know that one of people of the Winterspoon family came to Nahash Forest.{nl}Even so, since you know this person, he or she must be reliable.{nl}I'm counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001305	I can't exactly remember what I did back then.{nl}It's as if I was possessed by something...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001306	Yes! {nl}I wouldn't have done such a disrespectful act with a conscious mind.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001307	I will apologize to the other monks later.{nl}I can't believe what I did.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001308	Look around you.{nl}Don't you think it's beautiful?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001309	The red blood of the demons contains special powers.{nl}That's why only their blood can wash away the corrupted power of the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001310	The Tree of Truth sect turned the monastery into a complete mess...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001311	We have to clean up the blood of the demons and tidy up the scripture...{nl}We have many things to do.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001312	It will be effective!{nl}Even so... If it goes wrong, you should tell me... For sure...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001313	Revelator, I am eternally thankful to you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001314	Dominikas opened my eyes to a new light.{nl}Only the Divine Tree can save us...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001315	I need to save my power since we don't know when {nl}the Tree of Truth sect will rush into the monastery.{nl}I really thank you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001316	How could we lose the monastery to heresy like the Tree of Truth sect...{nl}I feel sorry for the goddess and I am thankful to her.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001317	I won't be deceived by the lies of the goddess anymore.{nl}You also think so, right?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001318	You really are...{nl}You might be the envoy that was sent by the goddess...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001319	What's strange is that Dominikas often visited Pagarba Chapel.{nl}It could very well mean that he may have hidden something important there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001320	If you hide there, you will definitely manage to ambush Dominikas.{nl}I will pray for you in the name of the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001321	As we cleaned up the monastery...{nl}I found a bunch of the Soul Spheres that were left by Dominikas.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001322	Can you remember when you broke the sinister idol?{nl}How about I put the demon souls into the sphere and purify them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001323	I will give you the Soul Sphere if you could defeat the demons with these, please.{nl}You can put the souls into this sphere.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001324	One day, I will become the Alchemist Master!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001325	I'll receive help from Vaidotas until I become the Alchemist Master.{nl}It's not because I lost to Vaidotas, it's just that I'm trying to use him!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001326	Really!!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001327	I sense something strange in the villagers. As he said, let's help the villagers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001328	Believe in the Divine Tree and let it save you.{nl}The door of the Tree of Truth sect is always open.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001329	Fake goddesses, untruthful doctrines... Are you sure that your belief in them has become quite strong?{nl}But that's the wrong path to salvation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001330	Tell me when you are ready.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001331	I regret that I may have done something wrong due to hunger.{nl}If Dominikas came instead of you... I guess we won't be able to go back...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001332	I am worried about the abbot.{nl}He is old... I hope the goddesses take care of him...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001333	Ahah... No matter how much I think, there is no way.{nl}Now, everything may be ruined...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001334	I haven't seen you before.{nl}What has brought you this far?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001335	It doesn't matter.{nl}If there's nothing special, can you listen to this old man will you?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001336	This was... originally a sea...{nl}We were fishers who caught fishes in this sea.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001337	But, as you can see...{nl}The land suddenly soared upwards.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001338	At first, I was thinking whether I should quit fishing, but... it soon turned out alright.{nl}I've earned a lot of money by picking up corals. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001339	The monsters were, without a doubt, a bit scary, but the lord was there to help us.{nl}The lord sent her army and the Lord Lieutenant in exchange for a offering.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001340	But not too long ago, the monsters went crazy.{nl}We couldn't pick up the corals and even had to evacuate.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001341	Of course, we have told the Lord Lieutenant about this.{nl}However, he said protecting the town and defeating the monsters {nl}were two different things, and the latter would cost additional tributes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001342	We've ran out of the corals that we've collected. {nl}The merchants are waiting for us... What should we do...{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001343	I am just saying it is.{nl}Thank you for listening to the complaints of an old man.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001344	Hmm... Are you the rumored Revelator?{nl}I've heard you possess quite some talented skills.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001345	Have you heard of the coral named Lhu'uvik?{nl}It's a valuable coral used for creating magical tools or for finding magic principles.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001346	I've come all this way to trade it...{nl}As you probably see, I am in trouble.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001347	There is nothing more important than the schedules and the promises of a merchant.{nl}If we go empty-handed like this, we will suffer from tremendous damage.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001348	It's not only us, but it also counts for those villagers.{nl}If it continues like this, they will lose their jobs and {nl}wander around looking for other places to live.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001349	I want to borrow your power to help those poor villagers.{nl}Can you help me so that they can start collecting coral again?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001350	Thank you for accepting.{nl}First, that lieutenant doesn't want to receive anything besides the corals for tributes.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001351	Eventually, we will have to get rid of the monsters so that the villagers can gather corals.{nl}You are the only one I can trust, get rid of them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001352	I hope this clears up...{nl}In case something happens, while you are taking care of it, {nl}I will send a person to look at the status of the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001353	It will be great if we could just drive out the monsters, but...{nl}Something's up.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001354	Oh, you've come back already?{nl}You're just as great as I've heard.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001355	I knew it wouldn't be that easy.{nl}It's so strange that many monsters are rushing in so quickly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001356	This is not just related to the monsters. There must be a different reason.{nl}I will investigate this seperately. Can you ask people here if they saw something strange?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001357	You would think the Lord Lieutenant would be the first one to help, but no!{nl}He would rather waste his time threatening us... How strange.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001358	If it was just a matter of taxing additional tributes,{nl}why doesn't the Lord Lieutenant take some measures.{nl}Anyway, how did the investigation go?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001359	So as the number of monsters increased, the strange smell started to spread.{nl}Hmm...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001360	I can't think that the monsters are not related to the smell.{nl}Can you check where that smell is coming from?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001361	If we are lucky enough, we might be able to find the source of the smell.{nl}If you find it, please bring it to me. I will get rid of it right away.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001362	I am counting on you.{nl}Please check the coast for spots where the smell is coming from.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001363	The smell and the monsters...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001364	Just as I thought! In the contents of the pouch was a powder that allures monsters.{nl}Somebody must have deliberately used them to draw the monsters in.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001365	If the smell disappears, there will be no reason for the monsters to go crazy.{nl}Can you dig out the same pouches from the pit?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001366	I will find out more about the pouch in the meantime.{nl}I don't know yet whether it suddenly came or if someone buried it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001367	Oh my god... This many...{nl}I can see why so many monsters are being drawn in.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001368	Someone is definitely disturbing the coral harvesting.{nl}I don't know why, but whoever it is must be evil.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001369	Yes.{nl}I told you that the Lord Lieutenant is little strange.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001370	It would be quite efficient of the Lord Lieutenant for him to go out and defeat the monsters.{nl}Even if this delays the tribute delivery a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001371	Yet, he didn't do it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001372	If he knows defeating the monsters is a waste of time...{nl}I think everything is coming together, now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001373	If what I am thinking is correct, the Lord Lieutenant will try to steal the tributes.{nl}However we don't have the evidence to support that claim.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001374	Alright... Let's answer our suspicions right now. Do we lure the suspect out?{nl}I want you to be responsible for the most important role.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001375	I've told the Lord Lieutenant in advance.{nl}The smell was spreading badly in the pit, making it unable to bear.{nl}I've gotten rid of the source and he thanked me for that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001376	In the meantime, please hide with the mayor.{nl}Of course, the soldier who will catch the culprit should join. {nl}He should act like an observer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001377	Of course, we can't rule out that some of the soldiers may have had a hand in this...{nl}But, you don't have to worry since Basilius is reliable and a very close friend of mine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001378	Anyway, since the lieutenant found out that all the pouches were removed...{nl}He will appear again and bury the pocket.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001379	Let's strike all at once, then.{nl}I will block the retreat route in case something happens. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001380	I am counting on you then.{nl}When you go, I will start my task as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001381	You're safe.{nl}Don't worry, the lieutenant was caught with the villagers.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001382	What a cruel and cunning man. Cowardly and dishonorable as well. {nl}He also ratted other soldiers out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001383	As I expected, they were stealing the tributes.{nl}They lured the monsters and began to steal in earnest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001384	He was blinded by greed and endangered everyone...{nl}I am well acquainted with the lord. Let me take the other soldiers to her.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001385	Due to your help, I was able to keep the schedule and start picking up the corals again.{nl}Thank you so much. You've saved us and the villagers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001386	After you have removed all the pouches from the Lhu'uvik Coral Reef,{nl}the number of monsters have decreased quite significantly.{nl}Such a blessing... It's truly a blessing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001387	But what if some pouches are still out there...{nl}The monsters are coming more slowly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001388	Thank you.{nl}You keep helping us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001389	You are a godsend to us.{nl}Without you, we would have turned into refugees once again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001390	You found them all? {nl}What a relief.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001391	Hmm, maybe... This is just an idea.{nl}But, how about about we throw the powder that came from the pouches away from the pit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001392	Then, the monsters will be directed there. Right?{nl}Can you help us out?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001393	Near the Atskiles Cay would be the ideal spot.{nl}Godspeed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001394	As mayor, it's embarrassing, but I almost gave up on everything.{nl}Whatever it is, I think we made the right choice with staying put.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001395	A large number of monsters came? {nl}Damn it... It was very effective, but it puts us in danger.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001396	I am so sorry to give you a hard task.{nl}I'll tell everyone not to touch the pouch.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001397	That coral... Where did you get it?{nl}That's called Arnim. It's a very important coral used in medicine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001398	There must be a habitat near the place where you obtained it...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001399	I am sorry, but can you look for their habitat?{nl}If you could look for the habitat of the Arnim coral, it would help the villagers a lot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001400	If you could find the habitat of the Arnim coral, it would be of great help to the villagers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001401	Nugara Sandbank?{nl}That deep... We will have hard time extracting it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001402	We better let the refugees know. We should find a way together.{nl}Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001403	I am sorry, but can you help us out?{nl}We have many wounded, but the medicine ran out... {nl}Things are getting worse the longer we go without help...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001404	We've already used all the medicine the merchants could offer,{nl}and we have no way of getting any more.{nl}We can make an ointment if we have the ingredients...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001405	Please, get me Greentoshell Shell Fragments and Blue Lapasape Mosses.{nl}With those I can make an emergency ointment for the injuries.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001406	It's not a severe cut, but if we leave it, it will decay.{nl}There are many people hurt, but I can't do a thing...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001407	Thank you. Thank you so much.{nl}This will help you a lot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001408	I am sorry. I found a small box that was dropped on the wrecked ship...{nl}Do you know anything about it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001409	Ahah... So you don't know.{nl}This is sealed with magic so it can't be opened.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001410	Something important seems to be inside...{nl}Can you help me open the box?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001411	The device that can unseal the box must have been on that ship with it.{nl}But we only have gotten the box. So, we have no idea from where it came from.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001412	It must be buried in somewhere near the wrecked ship or the area near it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001413	What could possibly be inside it? For someone to go this far to seal it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001414	What is this bag?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001415	Ah, there is a small magical stone in the bag!{nl}Thank you for finding it for me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001416	What's going to come out? {nl}I hope it's some jewelry or an accessory...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001417	The Lord Lieutenant was behind all this? {nl}I would teach him a lesson myself, but the lord will do a better job.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001418	I am so sorry to disturb you...{nl}Can I ask you something?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001419	At least, we can take some comfort in the fact that we do not have to be on the run again.{nl}Our normal lives will return. This is too good to be true.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001420	Now, everything is screwed up.{nl}Our coral picking is ruined, and our village is finished for...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001421	Everything was suspicious.{nl}The soldiers wouldn't leave if they didn't receive tributes; does it make any sense?{nl}It's good that you solved all of this.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001422	Although we said we'd pay on the behalf of the townspeople,{nl}the soldiers would only leave if given tributes.{nl}Without any means to gather the coral that composed the tributes,{nl}the townspeople couldn't catch a break...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001423	What should we do...?{nl}We should quickly gather some coral and hurry back...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001424	I told them that there are many monsters, but they still went and got hurt.{nl}We are so desperate, but it seems the tributes are more important for the lieutenant than people.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001425	This pouch was buried in the spot where the smell was coming from?{nl}Let's see...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001426	Since so many monsters are attacking, the number of wounded is increasing in turn.{nl}We don't have enough medicine...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001427	If it weren't you...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001428	I knew it was strange.{nl}It was a smell we couldn't understand.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001429	These are hard times.{nl}The deadline is coming up, but we can't get any coral...
