QUEST_LV_0300_20150323_000004	I'm not blaming the goddesses and the priests.{nl}But I think it's too much when they tell us to just trust them and wait.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150323_000005	The seals in the village are supposed to be sealed - that's why they're called seals, {nl}so what's the big deal? The priests are just trying to scare us for no reason.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000084	Gather Poisonous Weeds
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000085	Svitrigaila tells you that, as a Revelator, it wouldn't be bad for you to help him commit suicide, and he asks you to gather some poisonous herbs for him.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000091	You gave Svitrigaila the poisonous herbs, and it appears that he ate them, but you don't see any change in him. Try speaking to him again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000092	Seeing as there was no effect on Svitrigaila when he ate the poisonous herbs, it must be that he needs to mix them with holy water first, and then eat them to get the desired result. Find the Cleric Master and get the holy water from him.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000093	Destroy the Terminal
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000094	Talk with Svitrigaila some more.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000102	According to Svitrigaila, you need to amplify the power of the explosive powder in order to destroy the next terminal, and for that, you'll need to scrape off and collect particles from petrified objects in this area.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000103	Blow up the Terminal
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000104	Use the explosive powder Svitrigaila gave you and the petrification particles you collected to blow up the second terminal.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000105	Ask Svitrigaila what you need to do to destroy the next terminal.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000106	Destroy the Terminal
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000107	Svitrigaila says that the third terminal will get knocked out if anything comes near it. Retrieve the core from the petrified monsters nearby and throw it at the terminal to destroy it.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000109	Now that you've gotten rid of all the terminals, return to Svitrigaila.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000112	Destroy the Soul Compactor
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000113	You have crafted Svitrigaila's Orb. Now take the orb to the Soul Compactor.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000121	Who cares what happens to this body that I can't move, or even escape from.{nl}I just want to rest a little.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000122	You just need to gather the poisonous weeds from the area above us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000123	That area's known for its Bluebane...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000124	Thank you. Let me try eating these one by one...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000125	Just as I feared... I'm still here.{nl}I heard the Cleric Master has holy water that, when mixed with Bluebane, {nl}can easily kill any demon.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000127	Have a safe journey to Klaipeda.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000128	...?{nl}The soulkeeper of Dingofasil District?{nl}Isn't he a demon?

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000130	I will never involve myself in a demon's work.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000131	I see... I should have expected that...{nl}I was a fool to hope otherwise.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000132	If it comes down this, I guess I'll have to try that method now.{nl}Destroying the Soul Compactor that's here... The beings that sent me here told me.{nl}The Soul Compactor and I are one and the same. Why didn't I remember this until now?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000133	Somewhere in this area is a Soul Compactor that absorbs human souls.{nl}It condenses their energy and uses it.{nl}This is a really suitable location for the Soul Compactor because, {nl}even after the Petrifying Frost blew through, it's still bustling with the activity of the {nl}Knights of Kaliss, grave robbers, and the soldiers of the Royal Army.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000134	{nl}{nl}If I think about it, the beings that sent me here must have linked my life with the Soul Compactor so that I could collect souls for them forever. So if the Soul Compactor is destroyed, wouldn't I die with it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000135	The Soul Compactor has 3 terminals from which it absorbs souls.{nl}That bad feeling you had earlier was also a terminal trying to absorb your soul.{nl}For now, try to wipe out those terminals.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000136	{nl}If you succeed in destroying a terminal, you should be able to retrieve its core.{nl}You need to collect those cores to craft an orb that will help you destroy the Soul Compactor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000137	Good job. This core will be used to make an orb that will overload the mainframe of the Soul Compactor.{nl}Now I can feel my death drawing near.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000138	Try blowing up the second terminal.{nl}Here, I'll give you some explosives, but you'll need to scrape off some particles from petrified{nl}objects in this area to amplify the power of the explosives.{nl}Since the Petrifying Frost blows through here often, there are plenty of petrified objects {nl}everywhere.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000139	Again, you'll need to retrieve the core from this terminal too.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000140	Now there's only one terminal left... I feel myself getting weaker...{nl}The last terminal is probably short-circuiting.{nl}Try getting cores from petrified monsters in the area and throwing them at the terminal.{nl}That should be enough to make it collapse.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000141	And of course, bring back the core from the last terminal.{nl}Condensed souls are concentrated within those cores... {nl}We just need to use them to craft an orb that will overload the Soul Compactor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000142	Now you've collected them all. Here, I'll give you the manual.{nl}Use this to craft the orb to overload the Soul Compactor.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000143	I just want to rest...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000144	Is this the last time? Really.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000145	Let's see if we have all the detonators.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000146	You've come... but it's already time for me to go.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000147	I feel drained.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000148	Yes. That's it. Give it to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000149	Notice/!/When you touch the device, it feels like your soul is being drained!{nl}You must find someone who can fix this situation!

QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000163	You need to move on to repair.{nl}Be careful of the Petrifying Frost.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000164	Holy water?{nl}What do you need it for?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000165	There is a demon who needs holy water at Dingofasil District?{nl}...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000166	I won't concern myself with your personal matters, but I can't help demons as a cleric.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000167	Maybe this is the only way...{nl}Destroying the Spirit Integration Device...{nl}The ones who sent me here told me that the Spirit Integration Device and I are one. {nl}{nl}How could I forget that?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000168	The Spirit Integration Device absorbs souls from 3 terminals.{nl}The curse from a while ago was the process to absorb souls.{nl}Let's destroy the terminals one by one.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000169	Then bring the core.{nl}Oh, I'll cast a spell on you so you won't be cursed again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000170	We should destroy the second terminal. {nl}I will give you some bombs, but to amplify the effects of the bombs, {nl}you will need some petrified water powder.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000171	We should get the core of the terminal this time as well.{nl}Hmm... the spell has been released so that we won't get hurt by the spell. I will lock it again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000172	Here it is.{nl}The broken detector can be easily fixed with these parts.{nl}If the parts don't stay in place very well, get some strings from the nearby monsters and {nl}use them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000173	The repair, itself, isn't that hard. It is hard to obtain necessary parts.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000174	You've come back from a long journey. So these are the parts.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000182	By the words of the Royal Army Guard Retia, let's look for the other guards who had been {nl}dispatched to the Coastal Fortress. If they got into an accident, please collect their keepsakes. {nl}The monsters might have taken them so it would be a good idea to hunt for the monsters{nl}at the Coastal Fortress.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000213	I am guiding the spirits that suffered from the Petrifying Frost long ago.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000214	But the Petrifying Frost is the curse of the Demon Queen Gesti...{nl}It make us Kupoles turn into stone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000215	We should at least find out when the Petrifying Frost will blow.{nl}There are some petrification detectors which humans left behind, but some seem to be broken.{nl}Can you help me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000216	The detector you saw seems to be working well.{nl}Please look at how the other detectors are working.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000217	The Petrifying Frost turns everything into stone. Even spirits.{nl}We, Kupoles, are no exception.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000218	Ah, that's it.{nl}Two of them are broken.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000219	We better ask about the soldiers who created the detectors about them.{nl}I heard the person named Retia is the officer so we may receive some help from her.  
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000220	He is at Verkti Square.{nl}Human matters cannot be resolved by the Kupoles, so we are counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000221	Are you talking about the petrification detector at the Coastal Fortress?{nl}We are already aware of that.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000222	It hasn't arrived yet? {nl}I've already dispatched the soldiers there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000223	I don't have a good feeling about this.{nl}Due to numerous monster attacks here, we don't have additional forces to send.{nl}Can I ask you to follow the guards who were dispatched for the repair?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000224	Maybe they have been attacked at the Coastal Fortress.{nl}But, they are the guards of the kingdom. Their dead bodies should be brought here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000225	The Petrifying Frost is reported frequently at the entrance of the Coastal Fortress,{nl}so I think they will be around there. In case you find some corpses, please collect them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000226	I guess it was too late. Thanks for collecting the corpses.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000227	Please come back after fixing the petrification detector.{nl}I have something to say.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000228	I am counting on you to guide all the spirits to the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000229	Lastly, there's some story that they want to tell to the Revelator.{nl}You will want to know why humans are suffering from this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000230	The rumor that the Petrifying Frost is the sin of the revolt is just a made-up story.{nl}The curse came after the revolt so they may well think so.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000231	No, however. {nl}Everything was their plot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000232	The ones who broke it first were the demons, however.{nl}That's the Petrifying Frost... they died and their spirits have become stone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000233	Demon Queen Gesti brought the curse of the petrification on this land,{nl}and the goddesses tried to save the humans. But, the demons asked us whether {nl}we had forgotten not to interfere with each other's matters and...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000234	Wait. This memory is too horrible..{nl}A horrible catastrophe has landed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000235	Like a big disaster that the goddess might abandon to save this petrified place.{nl}The Petrifying Frost... All of that... This is what we must suffer through to save that which {nl}we abandoned.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000236	I will try to save the spirits from now on.{nl}Since you fixed all the detectors, we will be able to guide the spirits to eternal sleep.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000237	We will do our best to guide each and every one of them.{nl}I hope the goddesses bless you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000238	I guess you can't trust me since a demon like me is asking you a favor.{nl}But, look at me closely. It doesn't matter if you laugh at me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000239	I've tried my best to escape for hundreds of years.{nl}But, the curse of the petrification is the power of the Demon Queen. {nl}This endless depression is suffocating me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000240	Even if you escape, you're still a traitor.{nl}You'll be called a "traitor" while at the feet of the colleagues who mocked you...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000241	If you cooperate towards my death, I will definitely remove your curse.{nl}I promise in the name of Giltine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000242	It doesn't matter what happens to my body.{nl}I just want to rest...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000243	The poisonous plant that grows up there would be able to take my life away.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000244	I will pray that a plant that is poisonous to humans brings me eternal rest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000245	Thanks. Now, I will pray for the end of my agonizing life.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000246	So nothing occurs as I expected.{nl}If that's the case... We can't say we are in distress. We just have to rely on the one{nl}that we demons want to eliminate.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000247	Please bring the holy water from the one who follows the call of the goddesses.{nl}That sacred power will lead me to death.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000248	I heard the Cleric Master handles the holy water.{nl}I don't know if he's going to give me any.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000249	Are you talking about holy water?{nl}I am sorry, but may I ask you where you are going to use it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000250	There are demons who need the holy water?{nl}I am sorry, but I can't help you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000251	I am not going to be involved in your personal matter.{nl}No matter what the reasons are, I can't help a demons' matters as a priest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000252	As a priest, I can't cooperate on the tasks of the demons.{nl}I hope you understand this as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000253	So... that's it.{nl}Maybe, we came to expect something that we shouldn't expect.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000254	The people who I believed to be my colleagues betrayed me. {nl}Then, there is no reason for me to hold on to this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000255	The Demon Lord has ordered me to collect the spirits of humans that will be dedicated to God.{nl}That's why we began working on creating the integrator which would collect the spirits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000256	The process was smooth, but I suffered from the curse of the Petrifying Frost.{nl}Frozen freak, they said while laughing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000257	That I will be the soure of magic of the integrator.{nl}How did I come to forget this...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000258	You must know by now.{nl}The curse that has been put on the barrier stone... we use it to pull spirits from humans.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000259	The spirits that were pulled will be gathered to the integrator and dedicated to the god.{nl}The god... it is like me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000260	The integrator is being protected by three barrier stones.{nl}Destroy the barrier stones down there and obtain the cores from them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000261	I will cast a spell on you so that you won't get cursed again.{nl}The integrator moves by consuming my vitality so it's easy for me. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000262	The guys who abandoned me and laughed at me can't be called our colleagues.{nl}I will get my revenge by killing them. I will make them regret that they treated me {nl}like a source of magic.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000263	Well done. My death is near.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000264	The next barrier stone is up there. {nl}We have to put in great power all at once. Like an explosion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000265	Okay... there was a grave robber among the ones who were sacrificed.{nl}I tried to lead myself into death using a bomb, but it was useless.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000266	We should not forget about the core of the barrier stone.{nl}To avoid being cursed again, I will cast a spell.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000267	How come I never thought about this.{nl}Maybe my loyalty has surpassed the fear of loneliness.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000268	The last barrier stone must be exploding by now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000269	As the monsters were being petrified, their last breaths were also solidified... {nl}Throw those against barrier stones.{nl}They will gradually collapse.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000270	The core of the barrier stone is composed of condensed spirits.{nl}We will make orbs by collecting those that would destroy the integrator.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000271	I will put the last of my power into the cores of the barrier stones which you've collected.{nl}Pull out monsters' detonators with this and make an orb.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000272	Of course, I will give you a method to make the orb.{nl}The orb that would destroy the integrator.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000273	And, please fulfill my last wish.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000274	I've handed over the method to make the orb with my power.{nl}It will be easy to make an orb.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000275	Succeeded...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000276	Do you know the meaning of the name Giltine?{nl}Her name means death. The only thing that I can rely on at the moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000277	I once thought that I didn't care what I turn myself into if it was for the demons long ago.{nl}But, only the Petrifying Frost blew to me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000278	I started to slowly harden over hundreds of years.{nl}My name has been erased from everyone's minds.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000279	Even if she doesn't bring me eternal rest, it will be better than now.{nl}I just want to rest...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000280	Death is coming to me.{nl}I feel good.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000281	Yes. That's it. Give it to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000282	Within the keepsakes you've found for me...{nl}There must be some parts that will fix the detector at the Coastal Fortress.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000283	Here it is. {nl}The repair shouldn't be that hard.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000284	The Royal Army was taught that they should be loyal and honorable to the kingdom.{nl}And to be committed to due diligence when engaging in their duties.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000285	You came back a long way.{nl}So these are the parts to fix the petrification detector.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000286	It must have been hard to obtain the parts, but the repair itself shouldn't be that hard.{nl}Let's return.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000287	Pillar
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000288	(It seems like something is written on the pillar.)
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000289	(It seems that some letters are visible, but I can't clearly see them.)
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000290	To be able to read the letters, you must have a piece of the symbol.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000291	{nl}You can obtain the piece of the symbol somewhere in Galeed Plateau.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000292	(Something is written, but is not legible.)
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000293	(It seems that something is written on it, but it can't be read in this condition.)
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000294	That ring was given to me by my mother.{nl}I want to go back home with it, back to where my mother is...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000295	Our house is in the inner castle district...{nl}Please... I want to go back home with the ring...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000296	Yes. Gailus Legwyn is my old friend...{nl}But even an old friend shouldn't just take a precious object and not return it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000297	If her father is dead, then she should pay for the debt!{nl}Besides, I didn't even see that lady named Justina.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000298	I don't care who she is. It doesn't matter as long as she brings back my object.{nl}I don't care if that woman really is his daughter or not.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000299	I'm not doing any more trades.{nl}Why do I have to experience this kind of shame?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000300	I want to see Justina...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000301	I feel like I age a hundred years whenever I deal with Pardoners.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000302	If I can get back what's mine, I won't return to this place.{nl}His daughter is a successful woman, so she can take care of it.{nl}You better not get involved with these guys.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000304	This place is a military strategic point and it is also a dangerous area.{nl}You should be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000305	It is hard to maintain the army after the supplies stopped coming from the lower land.{nl}The problem is that the circumstances down there are more severe.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000306	We better do our duty fast...{nl}We just have to hang tight a little longer...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000307	I am not sure how to return to the army.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000308	Soldier Baskez
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000309	It will be our end if we sleep here.{nl}We better move our unit a little bit.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000310	We are going to freeze to death instead of dying from hunger.{nl}Are there any better options?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000311	Thank you so much for saving me last time.{nl}I want to help you, but I am tied to the army...

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000315	Mesafasla is suffering because of the monsters, though this place is also harsh.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000316	I was able to return to the army because of you. Thanks.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000317	I don't know why I volunteered myself to be a military courier.{nl}My tasks are becoming harder ever since the monsters went crazy.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000319	Supplies are running out, but we still have many people.{nl}You know, I actually rather wish that they would all run away.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000320	We get some supplies from hunting the monsters nearby... It's not enough, though...

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000324	I won't have any strength to fight by just eating meat.{nl}Everyone knows it's important to eat a variety of food.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000325	Since this place is colder than other areas, it is important to consume nutritious food.{nl}As a supply officer, I am having a hard time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000326	An outsider is better at going down the mountains.{nl}You will either freeze to death or die from hunger.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000327	Although the kingdom has become famous, we are still soldiers.{nl}This is a military zone. Please leave you are not an official.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000328	I heard that this place was used as a workshop.{nl}We are able to find old materials easily, but the problem is the food shortage.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000329	I am worried since the number of my men who are running away is increasing.{nl}Our supplies will last longer, but I am worried that I may become the only one left.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000521	Damn, theres nothing we can do.{nl}We better just follow their instructions for now.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000570	She is so disgraceful. The woman named Albinas...{nl}I don't know why she broke the tombstone.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000571	We were making a tombstone that would help the goddesses.{nl}We are going to collect the sacred energy and {nl}send it to the goddesses through the tombstone.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000572	We're going to collapse easily if we don't have something to rely on.{nl}That's why the belief of the goddesses is more important.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000573	I don't have any energy.{nl}I am investigating about the differences in views between Nestoses and Anastoses... {nl}I miss my research room.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000574	There is only one belief, but the views can be diverse.{nl}Like Nestoses and Anastoses there.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000581	I've heard that the demons are impersonating Anastoses.{nl}But, we are not going to argue for such matters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000582	We Anastoses are focusing more on the realities than Nestoses.{nl}We can't just do nothing while waiting for the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000583	However we all serve the goddesses and focus on our faith.{nl}That's why we are on our pilgrimage.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000684	Of course I won!{nl}However, I said I dropped the necklace I recieved as evidence from the guy into the sea.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000685	Back then, I gave up because the sea was too deep...{nl}Even now I'm not sure if I can still find it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000686	If I can find it, I think I will be able to deal a blow to those who says I am a bluff.{nl}It's near Kranto Coast. I recognized you as a Corsair, so you should be able to find it quickly.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000691	If you are a Doppelsoeldner, there is a task that you should do for the kingdom.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000694	The last contact we had was receieved from Fasika Plateau.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000695	That's so unfortunate. They've probably been attacked by the demons.{nl}Anyways, you have all of my support now that you've {nl}become a valuable member of the Doppelsoeldners.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000712	To give you a little hint, this is something you do behind their backs.{nl}Understood?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000713	You've collected enough of them as expected.{nl}By fulfilling this request, I can tell that you won't have a problem learning the last skill.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000715	Well, alright.{nl}Though, you need to understand that this will be very difficult for you {nl}if you want to learn this at your current level.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000716	I've been searching for the arrows that the first Fletcher Master created a long time ago.{nl}Those arrows were given to Lydia Schaffen as a present.{nl}I think they contain some sort of advanced technology.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000717	Recently, I've obtained useful information about the whereabouts of those arrows...{nl}There is a person who is able to identify the true value of those arrows.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000718	I've heard they were at Galeed Plateau.{nl}However, they were used when facing some violent monster, so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000719	Oh. I've only seen it for a short period of time, but I can tell how amazing it is.{nl}I want to do some research on this arrow immediately, {nl}but I've made a promise with you, so that's the first thing I'm going to do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000720	Okay... Let's get started.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000722	Of course I am satisfied with my partner, Rith..{nl}I think these attempts are helpful to Falconers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000723	When we tame a hawk, maybe we should feed it something?{nl}I don't have high expectations, but we better go there and try it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000724	I've placed some food for you to try it on at least three different types of monsters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000725	Did we fail... {nl}I expected it though.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000726	Regardless of the result, I should reward you for your effort.{nl}The biggest reward I can give to you would be teaching you new skills.{nl}What do you think?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000727	Shoot at an enemy and hit it...{nl}That's one of the basics of a Schwarzer Reiter.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000728	So you want to learn new skills, huh? {nl}Hitting an enemy with our eyes closed? How does that sound?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000729	Hahaha. However, we aren't blind. {nl}We shouldn't go that far, right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000730	I'm liking your confidence!{nl}I like it so much that we're going to put it to the test.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000731	Your objective is to accurately hit the targets multiple times.{nl}If you're able to do that, I will acknowledge your skills.{nl}So... I'd say about 200 times? Personally I think thats quite easy.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000732	I knew it wasn't a bluff! It was the confidence, am I right?!{nl}As promised, I will gladly become your teacher.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000733	The way of a true Monk...{nl}One should push oneself to extreme limits and endure the harsh training.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000734	If you are willing to take the challenge, then we will start immediately.{nl}Talk to me once you are ready for it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000735	If I were you I'd hurry up.{nl}If you don't defeat enough enemies within the time limit, we'll start from the beginning again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000736	Very good.{nl}Now is the time for you to learn something from me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000737	I know that you are ready to be a good Pardoner...{nl}But I'm kind of in big trouble.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000738	Well, those impious monsters ripped apart the book of offerings.{nl}Because of that, I can't proceed with my other tasks.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000739	I will tell you the location if you can get me that first book.{nl}I think of you as a trustworthy person since we are close...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000740	The first book is at Elkosh Abbey Hospital.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000741	In order to prevent someone from taking them, I've hidden them in the books...{nl}And I've prepared several fake books, so I want you to find them.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000744	Four years have passed after Medzio Diena...{nl}The aftermath of this disaster hasn't gone down at all, instead it's grown larger.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000745	Especially the plants that have grown so big turned into monsters and dealt a lot of damage.{nl}I am continuously doing research to resolve this issue.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000746	If you can help me with my research, I will teach you the next level of the Druid.{nl}I believe this will be an adequate assignment for you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000747	Please get me samples from the plants who have turned into monsters.{nl}You can obtain more samples the stronger the monster is.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000750	Suddenly, the evil energy has become stronger in the place I used to look {nl}at using divine power. Using Clairvoyance doesn't even work anymore for me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000751	I'm asking you if you could get rid of the evil energy that's lurking there?{nl}If you do, I promise you that I will help you reach the next level.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000752	The location is Galeed Plateau.{nl}Please put the Purification of Namott that I gave you to the area {nl}where the evil energy is strong. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000753	I knew you were the right person to do this.{nl}As promised, I will lead you to the next level of the Oracle.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000754	Good. Let's get started right away.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000755	You need to fight the monsters until the time limit expires.{nl}As you defeat stronger monsters, I will acknowledge that you've went through hard training..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000756	If you don't defeat them within the time limit, you start from scratch. {nl}Be cautious.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000757	Dragoon Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000758	A Dragoon should never move too far away from an enemy when in danger.{nl}The Dragoon needs to have the courage to fight harder, better, faster, and stronger.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000759	We reject the courage of those who fight without skills.{nl}The path of the Dragoon is a difficult path.{nl}So if you've come here without a strong sense of determination, I suggest you leave now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000760	Alright, let's see if you really are worthy enough to become one of us.{nl}Show me your skills.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000761	Your objective is to battle monsters and embrace the pain. Do not move away from them.{nl}That's the determination of a courageous Dragoon. {nl}So, attack and defeat the monsters even if you take damage from them. {nl}Good luck.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000762	What's this? We don't want anyone with a careless mind.{nl}Since I like you, I am giving you another chance. {nl}Come on, show me your courage and your skills!

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000765	A Templar is a leader to many people. We need people with strong leadership skills.{nl}Especially during these times, a Templar's leadership is the most likely required.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000766	Don't get me wrong, though. This is often misunderstood as 'authority'.{nl}No, I'm leaning more towards 'cooperation'.{nl}You should cooperate with your followers in order to maintain a group.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000767	Do you understand what I am trying to tell you?{nl}With that being said, let's see your skills as a Templar.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000768	A person in authority makes orders, but a Templar should make requests.{nl}Your task is to recruit five people and become their leader in that group.{nl}While being the leader of the group, you have to lead them for quite some time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000769	The fuel that drives people is the respect.{nl}So, to confirm if you possess this charm, I will put you up to the test.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000770	Oh, I absolutely do not like to be deceived by tricks or anything like that.{nl}Recruit five people all by yourself and become the leader of the group.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000771	Well done.{nl}You are certainly much more charming than I expected.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000772	It can be tough to make other people follow you.{nl}The more people following you, the tougher it becomes.{nl}It's not easy, but a Templar with great respect and admiration can pull it off.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000773	I will tell you the things that a Templar must have knowledge in.{nl}I hope you will make wise and careful decisions in the future, so do not forget this.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000774	Warlock Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000775	We will take any measures by any means for the goddesses...{nl}That is the strict rule that we, Warlocks, must abide by.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000776	There are many people who misunderstand our interpretations.{nl}A Warlock and its evil spirits are not equally contracted.{nl}We have to rule over them and able to control the evil spirits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000777	In order to do so, you need to possess strong magic able to rule and control the evil spirits.{nl}Unless... you want to end up consumed by them. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000778	Since you don't know these evil spirits as well as I do...{nl}I will give you a scroll that will wake them up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000779	Use this scroll on monsters at Valius' Eternal Resting Place{nl}to wake up the sleeping evil spirits.{nl}To add another part of this challenge, you need to defeat a monster and the evil spirits.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000780	Get rid of the poison with poison. {nl}Anything else that is evil should be gotten rid of by the evil spirits. {nl}I am waiting for the day when we, the Warlocks, are not needed anymore.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000781	Excellent.{nl}This is much better than I had expected.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000782	From now on, you will tread the path of the Warlock. {nl}Oh, and please remember this...{nl}If you don't stand on top of them, you will be consumed by them...{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000783	Featherfoot Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000784	I don't know how you found out about the curse of the Featherfoot, but...{nl}This curse should not be overused. Rather, it needs some detailed calculations.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000785	Of course, I can teach you if you still want to. However...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000786	Since you don't know anything about the curse, I ask you to take these incantation tools.{nl}I told you that it requires detailed calculations before using the curse.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000787	Find out what there is to lose and what there is to gain...{nl}Use these incantation tools to cast the curse on a monster to find out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000788	If you learn something here, you will become a great Featherfoot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000789	The curse should not be overused, but instead it requires some detailed calculations.{nl}Experience what the magic used by a Featherfoot is like with help of the tools.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000790	Now, do you have a broader understanding of the Featherfoot's curse?{nl}You should not consider it like the curse that is used by Demon Lords like Naktis.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000791	The arrows of the curse shall only be used on the enemies of the goddesses.{nl}For us, that is our most important guideline. Please keep that in mind.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000792	Cannoneer Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000793	You enrolled to become a Cannoneer? Good choice, hotshot.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000795	I figured you should know about this if you want to become a skilled Cannoneer, like me.{nl}What about it, hotshot? You interested?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000796	Good! Alright, hotshot. {nl}I can only assume that you will remember what I will teach you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000797	Do you have a paper and pen with you? Remember this.{nl}There are many types of enemies, but the ones that are flying in the air are all aerial-type.{nl}In contrast, the ones that are moving on the ground are considered a walking-type.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000798	Alright, face against monsters with both these types.{nl}You need to understand how each enemy moves and which attacks are effective.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000799	The flying monsters are aerial-types and {nl}the ones that move on the ground are walking-types.{nl}Face against both types of monsters. Understood?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000800	Good.{nl}Was this a good lesson? Am I a good teacher?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000801	Alrighty then! Theoretically, you should know all the logic about what I've taught you.{nl}It's time to put the theory into practice!{nl}The skills of a Cannoneer are not easy, so make sure to focus!
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000802	Musketeer Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000803	A Musketeer should know how to handle a rifle.{nl}Not many enemies can stand against simultaneous firing by well trained Musketeers.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000805	One of the basic aspects of marksmanship is to procure range.{nl}Give it a shot. Attack an enemy at maximum range.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000806	It's not just extending the range, but to extend it up the {nl}maximum distance where you are able to shoot.{nl}I am going to put you to the test to see how well you perform.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000807	It's not just extending the range, but being able to extend it up the {nl}maximum distance where you are still able to shoot.{nl}If you want to become a Musketeer, you will accept my challenge.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000981	Um... I know this may sound rude, but could you help me a bit more?{nl}It's a really simple task, but I can see myself getting robbed by monsters again...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000982	You just have to tidy up the research materials you've retrieved {nl}in the Tidying Chest at the Temporary Research Facility.{nl}I'm sure I can be at ease with someone of your skill doing it... Would it be too much to ask?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000983	Thank you so much!{nl}I'll give you the instruction manual so don't forget {nl}to check the last part before you start tidying up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000984	There is a strict order to tidying it...{nl}So, don't forget to read it thoroughly!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000985	Thank you so much.{nl}I'm glad I asked you for help.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000986	It seems as if I am in a daze because of the monster attacks.{nl}I think I discarded invaluable research materials while I was tidying them up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000987	The discarded documents should be gathered at Menka Knoll... Could you look for them?{nl}I can't manage to get there because of the increase in monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000988	I'm sure that you'll be able to find them if you take a close look at the {nl}discarded documents there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000989	The documents you need to find is the Research Material List for Alemeth Forest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000990	You can leave the rest of the documents behind.{nl}Please check carefully not to get them mixed up with anything else.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000991	Did you check them carefully?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000992	It seems like you've brought the correct documents.{nl}Go see Sarma after you give me the documents.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000993	I think he's kept an eye on your skills.{nl}I think he wants to ask you something after seeing you help me out.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000994	Sarma
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000995	Ah, greetings.{nl}I assume you've heard of me from Gatre.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000996	I've been keeping a close eye on you since you helped Gatre.{nl}At first I was merely curious of an outsider here, but you seem to be quite talented.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000997	As you may be well aware of, it is hard to do any research because of the monsters.{nl}I think I'll be able to finish my research if you help me out a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000998	It's for the wellbeing of the people here so I beg that you help out.{nl}Of course I shall pay handsomely when the research is finished.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000999	I thank you.{nl}My first request is for you to gather the blood of Green Eldigos.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001000	I need to extract the blood from a live Green Eldigo for my research, but that's no easy task.{nl}I'll give you some Tranquilizer Powder to knock {nl}the Green Eldigos out and bring some blood back.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001001	So, how did it go?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001002	Very good. Excellent.{nl}With the skills you've shown me, I think I can be confident in assigning you more tasks.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001003	I'll go to the Forest of Prayer Entrance and prepare for the final experiment.{nl}You can go and gather the ingredients needed for the last experiment.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001004	Gatre has the list for the ingredients I need for the final experiment so you can get it from him.{nl}I have faith in you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001005	Sarma said that he needed all of the ingredients on the list?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001006	Oh no, it seems as if he's already beginning the final experiment!{nl}We have to find more evidence before it's too late.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001007	It would be strange to not collect the ingredients without proper evidence.{nl}Collect the listed ingredients since you can't risk him suspecting anything.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001008	Why don't we gather some evidence together since Sarma seems to be absent.{nl}I know just what to look for.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001009	There are research notes from a person that used to help Sarma's experiments.{nl}His name was Boldas... and is in a coma because of an unfortunate accident.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001010	Sarma had those notes until he lost them in a monster attack.{nl}Come to think of it, I think Sarma was especially nervous about losing those notes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001011	There may be important information in those notes.{nl}He lost the notes towards the Juice Collection Site, so try searching that area first.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001012	Don't forget the listed ingredients either.{nl}I'll do what Sarma asked in order to avoid suspicion.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001013	Do you have all of the ingredients?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001014	Hmm. There seems to be something missing...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001015	Ah! It seems that it's missing from the list.{nl}I thought I had written everything down, but mistakes where made...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001016	I'm sorry, but could you go get some fermented fruit tree sap from Gatre?{nl}I can't proceed with the experiment without it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001017	Sarma told you that he needed fermented fruit tree sap right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001018	He really has come close to finishing the experiments.{nl}You see, I had removed the sap from the list on purpose.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001019	By the way, how does Sarma's research seem to you?{nl}Did you find anything suspicious in the research notes?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001020	I think that's a good idea.{nl}We might be able to find some clues as to what Sarma is really up to.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001021	That was written in the notes?{nl}I'll need to take a look at the notes myself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001022	Oh my...{nl}If these notes are true, then Sarma definitely has other plans for his research.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001023	But the matter still stands that we don't have any actual proof.{nl}I'll look for some solid evidence if you can manage to stall the experiments for a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001024	Take something that is similar to the sap in order to ruin Sarma's experiment.{nl}Meanwhile, I'll check all of his research documents.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001025	I'll give you this tree sap.{nl}All you have to do is to go to the Research Material Warehouse {nl}and find something that looks similar to this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001026	He has to mix all the ingredients before commencing the last stage anyways.{nl}So he won't be able to tell them apart as long as they look similar.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001027	Is this water from... near Pelke Shrine Ruins?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001028	I've heard that something bad happened there...{nl}Well, I suppose it will be alright.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001029	Take this to Sarma since they look almost identical at a glance.{nl}I'll take a peek at his research documents and try to find out his true purpose.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001030	Be careful just in case.{nl}I'll get to you as soon as I find something.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001031	What took you so long in bringing me one more ingredient?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001032	Well, it seems as if you've brought the proper ingredient.{nl}This is the last stage of the experiment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001033	Now all that is left is to put this on the Transmutation Magic Circle and add magic.{nl}I've set it so that anyone can power it with magic, so you shouldn't have trouble. {nl}Now go and power the magic circle.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001034	T-That's... because I have other things to do.{nl}I have to leave records of the experiment and observe the situation you see.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001035	Now stop stalling and go power up the Transmutation Magic Circle.{nl}All you have to do is put the ingredients on the circle {nl}and emancipate the magic from the tombstone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001036	But remember that the magic in the tombstone can only be emancipated from the front.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001037	Has the liquid properly been created?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001038	Ahah.{nl}It seems that I finally have results for this research.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001039	Now all I have to do is check to see if the liquid has the intended effect.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001040	Thanks to you, I've been able to get the research, which had been progressing slowly, this far.{nl}With this, we'll be able to restore the enlarged fruit trees back to normal.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001041	How about you spray the liquid onto the trees yourself since you've helped me so far?{nl}If it has been properly made, it will make the trees go back to their original states.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001042	Here, I'll give you some of the liquid.{nl}We'll be able to see if it has any effect immediately.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001043	Try spraying it on the Pile of Leaves just ahead of you.{nl}You'll be able to see something quite interesting.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001044	I'm sorry.{nl}I wasn't able to catch Sarma.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001045	Thankfully, the liquid wasn't created as Sarma planned.{nl}Even though he seems to think that it is perfect.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001046	Sarma's original plan was to create monsters that he could command.{nl}Thankfully, they don't seem to listen to him since we switched the ingredients a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001047	I'll go looking for Sarma.{nl}Even though the liquid is a failure, it's still quite dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001048	I hope that the hidden items will be found and used by whomever sees this inside the pot.{nl}There is another pot at the Old Camp that shows the location of the hidden items.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001049	Monster attacks have been too frequent lately.{nl}That's why Sarma's research is also being delayed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001050	Don't forget to read the last part of the instruction manual.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001051	It will be hard to find the documents at Menka Knoll if you don't read them carefully.{nl}There's a lot of documents that are actually being disposed there as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001052	I've put my whole life's achievements on restoring Alemeth Forest to its original state.{nl}This research must succeed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001053	Anyone would be upset about losing their notes.{nl}But Sarma... seemed to be much more than upset at the loss.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001054	The contents of those notes might prove to be important evidence.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001055	If you do get caught, just say that it was a simple mistake.{nl}The important thing is to buy us some more time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001056	First, help Sarma with his experiments.{nl}I'll try to find some evidence in the meantime.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001057	The magic from the tombstone must be emancipated from the front.{nl}The front is the side with the letters on it, so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001058	It is finally time for my research to come to fruition...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001059	I had merely panicked a bit because of the sudden attack.{nl}I am not frightened of such monsters!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001060	I'm conducting research in order to restore the forest to its original state.{nl}Those fruits are inedible you see...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001061	It was hard getting a chance to talk to you because of Sarma.{nl}Now, I can tell you everything since he's gone.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001062	I can't believe he was researching how to control monsters...{nl}I'm having a hard time believing how a person could even {nl}think of doing so even after witnessing it with my two eyes.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001063	They've all left because the fruits were inedible even though they were so large.{nl}But how could you turn your back on your hometown?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001064	What do you think the real purpose for Sarma's research is?{nl}I just hope that I'm worrying over nothing...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001065	The villagers all believed in Sarma and his research...{nl}How could he do such a thing?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001066	You're an outsider that I haven't seen before.{nl}I don't know what you're doing here, but please don't interrupt my research.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001067	Everything is going as planned except for those monsters.{nl}They're hindering my research so much that it's become more than a mere nuisance.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001068	I wish to show you the research once it's complete.{nl}Of course I will show it to Gatre who's been helping me all along as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001069	At last, the day that my research reaches fruition has come...{nl}It is a relief that I was able to receive help from someone as able as you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001070	Necromancer Lemija
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001071	Adomas is late...{nl}Where could he be?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001072	Where have Adomas and Faustas gone to when we have so much to do...{nl}Have you seen any Necromancers around here by any chance?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001073	It would have been hard even if we all worked together...{nl}But now, doing so is impossible.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001074	That Lord Lieutenant... He deserves to be attacked by monsters just like them.{nl}I'm only holding back because the mayor is too.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001075	The goddesses are so merciless...{nl}I had only started to collect coral after giving up fishing for a living...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001076	I think everyone is shocked by the Lord Lieutenant.{nl}Well... At least I'm glad that things turned out alright in the end.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001077	Just look at them.{nl}They were attacked by monsters trying to gather tributes...{nl}It's just so wrong.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001078	I'll be fine as long as I get some proper rest thanks to the first aid.{nl}You've been a great help.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001079	It's just pathetic.{nl}We don't even have basic amenities, but we're worrying about making tributes...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001080	That Lord Lieutenant will bring the wrath of the goddesses upon himself soon enough.{nl}He not only tried to get more tributes for himself, but also disgraced the lord.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001081	There is nothing more important to a merchant than credibility.{nl}I need to acquire the necessary coral in time... but it seems like I'm in trouble.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001082	I've heard. You've dealt with the terrifying monster that the Lord Lieutenant summoned.{nl}I wish that someone like you was in our merchant alliance.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001083	Don't stray too far from here if you can help it.{nl}The monster density increased so much that it's too dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001084	I never would've thought that my colleagues were also in league with the Lord Lieutenant...{nl}My head's still numb when I think of all those years we've served together.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001085	Please stay here where it's safe, if possible.{nl}There's no way for us to help if you stray too far away from here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001086	We're going to transport that Lord Lieutenant to the lord soon.{nl}I doubt that he'll get off easy...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001087	Please refrain from going too far away because there has been an increase of monsters.{nl}We won't be able to guarantee your safety due to our orders.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001088	An outsider helped out with something that we should have done ourselves...{nl}This is shameful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001089	Do you think I won't do anything after all of this humility? Wait and see. {nl}I'll show the merchant alliance and the refugees here who gets the last laugh some day!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001090	This guy, he still seem to be delusional.{nl}Does he really not know what situation he is in?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001091	It's all gone upside down because of that Lord Lieutenant and a few soldiers.{nl}I'm certain that they'll make inquiries into us as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001092	Merchant Alliance Worker
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001093	It was nice having a bit of a rest, but we weren't quite at ease either.{nl}I guess we can finally go to the customers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001094	I haven't been working here long, but that is a sight to behold.{nl}An ocean without any water... I've never seen anything like it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001095	I've heard that coral is really popular.{nl}I think it's said to be used in very expensive medicines... {nl}How much do you think it is worth?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001096	I guess anything can happen when the world is in such disarray.{nl}He's lucky the people here are gentle, he'd be thoroughly beaten if it was back where I'm from.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001097	What's going on?{nl}There are people willing to work and soldiers to protect them, {nl}yet we can't get the coral because of monsters?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001098	This used to be the bottom of the sea, but they say {nl}that all the water was drained after Medzio Diena.{nl}It's quite a sight don't you think?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001099	It's chilling to think that the Lord Lieutenant was the reason we weren't able to gather coral.{nl}I'm glad it's over now. All's well that ends well as they say.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001100	People like us have never even held a sword before, so all we can do is to envy your skills.{nl}Isn't it impressive that our leader found out that it {nl}was the Lord Lieutenant who was behind all of this?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001101	It's a shame about what happened to Faustas... But his crimes cannot be forgiven.{nl}He murdered... he murdered Adomas.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001102	I'm planning on carrying out the rest of the mission.{nl}I'll have to tell the master about what happened... But I don't feel too comfortable.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001103	Search for the Monk
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001104	It seems as if returning to the annex is out of the question.{nl}Look for the monk that's trapped in the principal building.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001105	You have found a labeled reagent bottle in a pile of leaves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001106	Base reagent. Nahash Sample.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001107	{nl}Look for the reagent's owner.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001108	A tent that appears to have been attacked by monsters... Check to see what happened?

QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001110	Lucienne is missing!{nl}It seems as if she has gone to the Ownerless Reclaimed Land to use the reagent.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001111	Searching past the Wall
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001112	It seems as if only Dominikas can pass through the black wall.{nl}Dominikas seems to be hiding something beyond the wall and lying about it.{nl}Search past the wall.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001113	Elgos Monk
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001114	I'm so... hungry...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001115	Starved
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001116	It seems as if there is nothing more to eat.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001117	Lucienne Winterspoon
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001118	Thank you so much for saving me!{nl}Whew, I was in a tight spot with my tent being attacked and all.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001119	Oh, my name is Lucienne Winterspoon by the way.{nl}I am a member of the Winterspoon family which is renown for its alchemical prowess.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001120	Vaidotas. You know him right?{nl}Alchemist Master Vaidotas is my older cousin.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001121	Have you heard that Vaidotas was kidnapped by the Vubbes?{nl}I mean, he's the Alchemist Master... {nl}I think I was more ashamed of the kidnapping than he was.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001122	That's why I've decided that I should take his place.{nl}Don't you think it's obvious that I'm more suitable for the position?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001123	The family elders are holding me back though.{nl}Would you believe that they're saying that they can't {nl}acknowledge my skill without distinct research results!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001124	That's why I came here.{nl}I'm trying to do some research on why the regions near Nahash Forest{nl}received less damage than other places on Medzio Diena.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001125	But I've been unable to make much headway because there are so many monsters.{nl}It turns out that the only reason it was damaged less is because the bedrock is more solid.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001126	Then I discovered something amazing in Nahash Forest!{nl}There was an enormous plant rooted to the Ownerless Reclaimed Land, you see.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001127	I thought it was perfect for my experiments because it wouldn't react to most substances.{nl}Think about it! Making a reagent that can get rid of such a large plant.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001128	I'll be able to restore damaged regions like Orsha or the Thorn Forest back to normal...{nl}It might even open a path to being able to prevent a second Medzio Diena from happening.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001129	Don't you think that the family elders will also acknowledge me as well?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001130	The problem is that the over abundant monster population is hindering my research.{nl}There should be less monsters if I could get to Pamesti Village...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001131	Of course. You seemed to be quite skilled back there...{nl}I'm sorry, but could you get me to Pamesti Village?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001132	I promise I won't forget you if you help me out this time after I become the Alchemist Master!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001133	Thanks! You've brought me to the village safely.{nl}Now I have to get ready for the experiments again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001134	...Oh! Whoops!{nl}I must have dropped my base reagent somewhere {nl}while I was running away from the testing tent...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001135	I can't do any more experiments without it, what a stupid mistake.{nl}What should I do...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001136	Yes! That's it!{nl}How on earth did you get a hold of it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001137	Oh... I must have dropped it in the tent I was conducting experiments in.{nl}It's a relief to have it back. Thank you so much. You're absolutely the best!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001138	Now I have to collect the remaining ingredients.{nl}I can get most of the herbs on my own, but I don't think I can take on the Blue Spion by myself...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001139	So do you think that you could get some Spion Tree Leaves for me?{nl}I'll try to gather the other herbs in the meantime.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001140	Thanks a lot.{nl}Let's meet up back here once we've finish gathering the ingredients.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001141	You're back earlier than I expected.{nl}I hope you didn't have too hard a time dealing with the Blue Spion.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001142	Now all I have to do is to mix the reagent with these ingredients.{nl}The only problem is that the monsters seem to be attracted to the smell of the reagent.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001143	Could you deal with any monsters that happen to come near me while I mix the reagent?{nl}So that I can focus entirely on mixing the reagent.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001144	It's finally finished! Thank you so much. {nl}I couldn't have dreamed of finishing the reagent without your help!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001145	Now all that's left is to test the reagent.{nl}Luckily, I've seen an appropriate vine near the Herb Broker Tent.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001146	Tree vines don't usually grow in Nahash Forest, but that place seems to be the exception.{nl}Strange isn't it? It almost seems like someone is raising them there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001147	It just doesn't seem right just like that enormous plant.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001148	Well whatever the case, that tree vine seems to be perfect to test the reagent on.{nl}How about doing the last experiment together since we've crafted the reagent together? 
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001149	Did you see that? The vine grew and then crumbled!{nl}It's a success! Our reagent actually worked!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001150	I can't believe that I completed a reagent without the help of Vaidotas...{nl}I'm so happy. The next Alchemist Master will be me when I show the family this reagent!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001151	So. Let's go the the Ownerless Reclaimed Land. {nl}I'm sure that we'll be able to get rid of the enormous {nl}plant there and stop the plants from expanding further.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001152	Alchemist Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001153	Lucienne Winterspoon...{nl}May I ask how you came to learn of the name of that troublemaker?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001154	What? You've brought me a reagent that she made in Nahash Forest?{nl}Please give that to me. What has she concocted up this time...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001155	...Oh dear. {nl}Did you perhaps test this reagent? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001156	This reagent accelerates plant growth.{nl}The plant will crumble if it doesn't have the strength to withstand it but if it does...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001157	We don't have time for this.{nl}Knowing Lucienne, she might have already gone to use the reagent somewhere.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001158	I'll give you this counteragent. Please hurry and give this to Lucienne.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001159	What took you so long?{nl}You said you'd ask Vaidotas didn't you?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001160	Having a healthy amount of scholarly ambition is something to be commemorated.{nl}But passion past her skills is not good for Lucienne.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001161	...Okay. I guess I was wrong this time.{nl}Something bad could have happened without Vaidotas' help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001162	That doesn't mean that I've lost to Vaidotas though!{nl}Don't you know that failure is the mother of success?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001163	I've failed miserably this time so I'm going to get a great breakthrough soon!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001164	There's no time for this.{nl}I think I can do the rest of the experiments by myself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001165	Farewell then. I thank you for all the help you've given me. {nl}I never forget my debts, so I will repay it one day by helping you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001166	No... Wait...{nl}Why is Vaidotas being brought up in this?!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001167	It's me who succeeded in the experiment, so why should Vaidotas get to see this?{nl}I've mixed this reagent, so why should Vaidotas...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001168	Is it because the vine we tested it on grew a bit?{nl}What does that have to do with anything. It's gone thanks to my reagent!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001169	...If it bothers you that much, you go by yourself.{nl}I don't want to go. Do as you please.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001170	Even though it's a bit infuriating, but Vaidotas took {nl}a look at my reagent's ingredients and mix ratio.{nl}It seems that I should have used Spion Teeth instead of the leaves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001171	I can get the rest of the materials, but Spions are still to much for me...{nl}Could you get me some Spion Teeth?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001172	Well... It would be nice if this mix ratio succeeds..{nl}It will mean that Vaidotas is wrong if it fails so...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001173	It would seem rude to not proceed with the experiment when he's being so considerate...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001174	Thanks. {nl}I'm going to humiliate Vaidotas after succeeding and improving the reagent!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001175	Are you planning on going elsewhere?{nl}Hm... Well then...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001176	I took a look at the soil from a farm on the Ownerless Reclaimed Land, and it was superb.{nl}I think that if I plant some experimental herbs there, they'll do well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001177	I'll give you the herb seeds. {nl}Could you plant them if you happen to pass by the Ownerless Reclaimed Land?{nl}Come on, you can help me out just a bit more can't you?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001178	I wouldn't have been able to get this far with the research without you.{nl}Even though I don't want to admit it, V-Vaidotas helped as well...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001179	Villager Nella
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001180	Thank you for saving us at the monastery.{nl}I can't imagine what that swindler would've done to us if it wasn't for you...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001181	Still, the swindler's incantation seems to be having a bit of an effect.{nl}We haven't been attacked by monsters for a while.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001182	Well, that doesn't mean that we can live in harmony with the monsters.{nl}We also don't know when we'll be attacked by the monsters again because the incantation's effect will wear off later.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001183	Could you help deal with the monsters near the town?{nl}It'll be much safer if you could help out a little.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001184	The village has been totally destroyed while we were trapped at the monastery.{nl}Well this... I suppose it was our own fault for getting tricked like that.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001185	Thank you.{nl}Oh, I don't think you'll have to worry about the rest of the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001186	Lucienne Winterspoon said that she'll craft us monster repellant while she stays here.{nl}I hope you'll stay safe on your travels.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001187	Welcome. Brother.{nl}Have you come to be redeemed by us of the Tree of Truth?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001188	If so, welcome.{nl}I was just educating the believers of our creed.{nl}How about you join us for a moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001189	Good. {nl}Now, I shall begin the sermon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001190	Oh yes... It might be a bit dizzy at first.{nl}That is all part of the process in receiving the Divine Tree's blessing.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001191	How was your first sermon about the creed? {nl}Was it alright?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001192	Good, good.{nl}I welcome you once more.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001193	Although the Divine Tree is benevolent, redemption does not come for free.{nl}You must work for the chance to be redeemed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001194	Helping other believers might be a good place to start since you are new.{nl}I hope to see you soon.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001195	Greetings. Brother.{nl}Have you received the Demon Soul Orb from Dominikas?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001196	The demons will not attack you on sight if you hold an orb filled with their souls.{nl}It seems as if you have yet to receive the orb from Dominikas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001197	I have an extra Soul Orb.{nl}But... you'll have to fill it with demon souls yourself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001198	Still, you won't have to worry about demons attacking you once it's filled with demon souls.{nl}The benevolent Divine Tree shall protect you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001199	I've learned that although demons are our enemies, they are also to be redeemed just like us.{nl}We will all become one in the blessings of the Divine Tree.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001200	I see you've filled the orb.{nl}How was it? I assume the demons didn't attack you on the way back?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001201	What? You were attacked?{nl}That's strange. It is most likely due to your lack of faith.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001202	Ah, look at the time...{nl}Pardon me, I must prepare to attend an important ritual.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001203	Welcome. You're the newcomer, right?{nl}I am selecting scriptures here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001204	To us, the goddesses are immoral as only the Divine Tree can offer true redemption.{nl}We no longer need the old scriptures that worship the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001205	What do we do with the useless scriptures?{nl}We usually gather them and burn them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001206	Thank you for saving me!{nl}Of course, this is all because of the blessing of the Divine Tree.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001207	Why do you think the demons attacked us?{nl}That is strange... This has never happened before.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001208	Farewell then... I need to attend a ritual.{nl}Make sure you're not late either, brother. I will see you later.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001209	Villager James
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001210	Oh, so you are the newcomer.{nl}It's a pleasure to meet you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001211	I am purifying the corrupted power of the goddesses with the red blood of the demons. {nl}However, it seems that I've run out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001212	Normally Dominikas gets it for me but he seems to be busy at the moment.{nl}Not to mention the fact that we are currently under {nl}their protection so we can't attack them either.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001213	That's why I want you to go get some red demon blood.{nl}As a recruit you can do this much, no?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001214	Thank you.{nl}Demon blood has a special power that can purify the corrupted power of the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001215	Look around you, all of this was the result of my purification.{nl}How about it, beautiful isn't it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001216	Well it's about time I leave.{nl}You're free to wander the monastery but try not to go near {nl}the black wall in the Annex Laboratory up there.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001217	That wall is full of holy energy so that only those chosen {nl}by the Divine Tree such as Dominikas can go there.{nl}Well then, see you later.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001218	...How did you get in here?{nl}This is a sacred place that only those who are chosen by the Divine Tree may enter.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001219	Oh my, it appears that the Divine Tree has already chosen you.{nl}I knew you were something special the moment I laid my eyes upon you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001220	To think that you were chosen the moment you joined, this is quite an amazing turn of events.{nl}There is a very important ritual coming up... a ritual to bestow the Divine Tree's blessings.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001221	All the other followers are waiting at the passage that leads to the annex.{nl}Although I must go ahead in order to prepare for the ritual, please take your time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001222	Hurry and deliver this.{nl}I can no longer stand to see the corrupted power of the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001223	I feel an evil presence coming from the vines that Dominikas left behind.{nl}To think that our monastery might have been covered in such a thing, how frightening.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001224	Is there any way to get rid of those vines?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001225	Hmm...You say that you need a particular reagent to get rid of the vines?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001226	You've arrived at just the right time.{nl}The reagent that Vaidotas was working on is done.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001227	Here!{nl}I'll call it "Lucienne's Special Reagent"!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001228	...What's wrong?{nl}It's real this time! I made sure it's safe this time!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001229	Even if you can't trust me you should trust Vaidotas!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001230	Welcome back.{nl}Please hurry, I don't want to look at the terrible vines any longer.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001231	That's Winterspoon for you!{nl}It's almost like that vine was never there, thank you so much, Revelator!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001232	Sorry for making you help us so much...{nl}We owe you our sincere thanks.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001233	I am talking about the scripture from the Order of the Tree of Truth left by Dominikas.{nl}It turns out that the impious thing still remains in the monastery.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001234	If you see the fake scripture, could you bring it to me?{nl}We're too short-handed to spare anyone at the moment...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001235	Those at the Order of the Tree of Truth... to think they would corrupt the power of the goddesses...{nl}This is just blasphemy to the goddesses!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001236	So you've found the fake scripture. Thank you.{nl}Give it to me and I will take care of it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001237	S-Stop...!{nl}I will do whatever you ask me, so please stop!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001238	Should I just join the Order of the Tree of Truth?{nl}If I did, would I be able to escape this hunger?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001239	Lies...{nl}If not... How... The black wall...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001240	It seems that he's been malnourished for a long time.{nl}I can't talk to him now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001241	Thank you so much...{nl}I am so sorry for misunderstanding you. I thought something was going wrong...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001242	After I regained my consciousness, I felt this mysterious energy from you.{nl}What happened?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001243	Ah... So you're the Revelator.{nl}I guess this is why the black wall couldn't block you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001244	Thank you. I was able to survive because of you.{nl}Dominikas... He's more cruel than the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001245	It hasn't been a long time since Dominikas visited the Elgos Monastery.{nl}I thought he was just an accompanying monk.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001246	Not so long after he came here, the tree vines and the {nl}demons suddenly swept the monastery annex.{nl}The villagers fled there... But, he stopped them appropriately.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001247	When I think about it, it was all a facade.{nl}The raid of the tree vines and the sudden attacks of the demons...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001248	As the villagers started to follow him, he quickly showed his true nature.{nl}He asked us to create a sinister idol and believe in the Divine Tree.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001249	Of course, we resisted... But he locked us into that black wall.{nl}He gave us just enough water to stay alive and tried to convert us to his religion.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001250	I felt so painful since I didn't know what to do.{nl}Ah... The abbot!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001251	The abbot must be locked inside the monastery.{nl}I was hoping that the goddesses would protect us... {nl}But we will be in trouble if we don't quickly give you the food.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001252	Elgos Abbot
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001253	This energy... Yes, it's you. The Revelator.{nl}It seems the goddesses finally answered my prayer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001254	Ah, nothing. If the other monks are alright, the food will be okay...{nl}I don't think I'll be able to swallow the food.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001255	He's too old... Is he going to be alright...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001256	As expected, Revelator, you're not blocked by the black wall.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001257	The sinister idol that was created by Dominikas in front of Pagarba Chapel...{nl}The black wall started to cover the monastery because of that idol.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001258	If we destroy that sinister idol...{nl}There might be a good chance that the whole wall may disappear.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001259	I just don't know how I can destroy it...{nl}There is nothing I can think of at the moment.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001260	No, wait...{nl}I can sense the demons' souls from you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001261	That sphere you have...{nl}Is a demon's soul locked inside it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001262	That's it.{nl}Maybe we can use this to destroy the sinister idol.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001263	The idea is to purify the demons' souls and use their power.{nl}Unfortunately, we lack the right amount of souls to destroy the idol.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001264	Can you fill it with a little bit more of the demons' souls?{nl}As you already may know, defeating demons will automatically absorb their souls.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001265	Without a doubt the demons are strong... that's why I guess that their souls are strong as well.{nl}My sacred energy is not strong enough to purify this much power.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001266	We should somehow borrow the power of holy water...{nl}Like I told you before though, I have nothing at the moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001267	I am so sorry, but can you get me Holy Water from the Priest Master in Klaipeda?{nl}If we have enough holy water, we'll be able to purify the demons' fallen souls.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001268	Please use the statue of Goddess Vakarine near Viyme Fountain.{nl}You can quickly come back from Klaipeda.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001269	With this, you'll be able to purify the souls contained within the Soul Sphere.{nl}Now, give me a moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001270	Since the power of a demon's soul is strong, the residual power after purification possesses strength as well.{nl}This power has the capability to destroy the sinister idol.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001271	Put the purified Soul Sphere's power into the sinister idol.{nl}I hope the idol can't endure this...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001272	Finally!{nl}Now, we can be freed from the black wall.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001273	It's been such a long time...{nl}I think my prayer to the goddesses was not in vain...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001274	Now, we'll need to focus on the main culprit of the Order of the Tree of Truth, Dominikas...{nl}Everything will be over once we drive him out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001275	Please lend me your power a little longer.{nl}Even if we have the methods to catch him, we can't use our powers {nl}since the villagers have been possessed from being tortured so long...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001276	He seems to have some sort of power that allows him to control plants.{nl}I sincerely warn you that he is not to be underestimated.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001277	Dominikas... He ran away...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001278	We shouldn't worry too much.{nl}It's a big blow that we drove out the Order of the Tree of Truth from the Elgos Monastery.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001279	And the monsters instead of plants' explosion, I guess it stopped since the spell was unstable.{nl}We were able to protect the villagers because of you.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001280	When we get better, we will clean up the monastery.{nl}Of course, we should drive out the demons as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001281	Even if the world collapses, we believe in people like you who give hope...{nl}You give us the power to endure.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001282	I don't want to imagine what would've happened without you...{nl}On behalf of the whole monastery, we greatly appreciate your help.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001283	You've done it!{nl}The black wall disappeared...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001284	Thank you for saving the monastery.{nl}Ah, is the abbot alright?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001285	...So that is it. {nl}Your faith is as strong as I imagined.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001286	Good! Anything. {nl}Just tell me what I can do for you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001287	What? {nl}So the villagers think we ran away after abandoning the monastery?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001288	Those people at the Order of the Tree of Truth... {nl}They locked others inside and alienated them...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001289	Can you go to the villagers with me?{nl}If you are with me, all misunderstandings will be solved.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001290	Hmm... It seems that the villagers found out the true identity of Dominikas.{nl}It is fortunate that the task was solved easier than expected...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001291	I will send the villagers back to the village.{nl}I really appreciate that you've reclaimed the Elgos Monastery from the Order of the Tree of Truth.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001292	The demons here are very strong. {nl}Be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001293	Don't underestimate the power of the sinister idol.{nl}Be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001294	Now, the Revelator will continue the journey by following the will of the goddesses.{nl}But before you leave, can you do me one more favor for this old man?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001295	Although we got rid of the Order of the Tree of Truth...{nl}The evil demons still prevail.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001296	If you lend me your power, we'll be able to drive out the demons much faster.{nl}Can you defeat the demons here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001297	There is something that is bothering me.{nl}I think driving out the Order of the Tree of Truth was wonderful, but...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001298	Dominikas ran away.{nl}I think he may come back by leading the Order of the Tree of Truth...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001299	I want to prepare something for this...{nl}Can you help me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001300	If Dominikas comes back again...{nl}Then, I will not stand idly by.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001301	Thank you. {nl}I can relax now because of you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001302	Good. You should do it.{nl}I was actually going to Veyrhas Hall to burn the scripture...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001303	It's better to see it once than to hear it a hundred times.{nl}Let's go together. Brother.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001304	I didn't know that one of people of the Winterspoon family came to Nahash Forest.{nl}Even so, since you know this person, he or she must be reliable.{nl}I'm counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001305	I can't exactly remember what I did back then.{nl}It's as if I was possessed by something...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001306	Yes! {nl}I wouldn't have done such a disrespectful act with a conscious mind.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001307	I will apologize to the other monks later.{nl}I can't believe what I did.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001308	Look around you.{nl}Don't you think it's beautiful?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001309	The red blood of demons contain special powers.{nl}That's why only their blood can wash away the corrupted power of the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001310	The Order of the Tree of Truth turned the monastery into a complete mess...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001311	We have to clean up the blood of the demons and tidy up the scripture...{nl}We have many things to do.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001312	It will be effective!{nl}Even so... If it goes wrong, you should tell me... For sure...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001313	Revelator, I am eternally thankful to you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001314	Dominikas opened my eyes to a new light.{nl}Only the Divine Tree can save us...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001315	I need to save my power since we don't know when {nl}the Order of the Tree of Truth will attack the monastery again.{nl}I really thank you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001316	How could we lose the monastery to a heresy like the Order of the Tree of Truth...{nl}I am sorry to the goddess and I am thankful to her.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001317	I won't be deceived by the lies of the goddess anymore.{nl}You also think so, right?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001318	You really are...{nl}You might be the envoy that was sent by the goddess...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001319	What's strange is that Dominikas often visited Pagarba Chapel.{nl}It could very well mean that he may have hidden something important there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001320	If you hide there, you will definitely manage to ambush Dominikas.{nl}I will pray for you in the name of the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001321	As we cleaned up the monastery...{nl}I found a bunch of the Soul Spheres that were left by Dominikas.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001322	Can you remember when you broke the sinister idol?{nl}How about I put the demon souls into the sphere and purify them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001323	I will give you the Soul Sphere if you could defeat the demons with these, please.{nl}You can put the souls into this sphere.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001324	One day, I will become the Alchemist Master!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001325	I'll receive help from Vaidotas until I become the Alchemist Master.{nl}It's not because I lost to Vaidotas, it's just that I'm trying to use him!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001326	Really!!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001327	I sense something strange in the villagers. As he said, let's help the villagers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001328	Believe in the Divine Tree and let it save you.{nl}The door of the Order of the Tree of Truth is always open.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001329	Fake goddesses, untruthful doctrines... Are you sure that your belief in them has become quite strong?{nl}But that's the wrong path to salvation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001330	Tell me when you are ready.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001331	I regret that I may have done something wrong due to hunger.{nl}If Dominikas came instead of you... we wouldn't have been able to go back...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001332	I am worried about the abbot.{nl}He is old... I hope the goddesses take care of him...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001333	Ahah... No matter how much I think, there is no way.{nl}Now, everything may be ruined...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001334	I haven't seen you before.{nl}What has brought you this far?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001335	It doesn't matter.{nl}If you have time, could you listen to this old man for a while?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001336	This was... originally a sea...{nl}We were fishers who caught fishes in this sea.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001337	But, as you can see...{nl}The land suddenly soared upwards.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001338	At first, I was thinking whether I should quit fishing, but... it soon turned out alright.{nl}I've earned a lot of money by picking up corals. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001339	The monsters were, without a doubt, a bit scary, but the lord was there to help us.{nl}The lord sent her army and the Lord Lieutenant in exchange for a offering.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001340	But not too long ago, the monsters went crazy.{nl}We couldn't pick up the corals and even had to evacuate.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001341	Of course, we have told the Lord Lieutenant about this.{nl}However, he said protecting the town and defeating the monsters {nl}were two different things, and the latter would cost additional tributes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001342	We've ran out of the corals that we've collected. {nl}The merchants are waiting for us... What should we do...{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001343	I'm just saying it is.{nl}Thank you for listening to the complaints of an old man.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001344	Hmm... Are you the rumored Revelator?{nl}I've heard you possess quite talented skills.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001345	Have you heard of the coral named Lhu'uvik?{nl}It's a valuable coral used for creating magical tools or for finding magic principles.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001346	I've come all this way to trade it...{nl}But as you can probably see, I've gotten in to trouble.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001347	There is nothing more important than the schedules and the promises of a merchant.{nl}If we go empty-handed like this, we will suffer from tremendous damage.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001348	It's not only us, but it also counts for those villagers.{nl}If it continues like this, they will lose their jobs and {nl}be forced to look for other places to live.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001349	I want to borrow your power to help those poor villagers.{nl}Can you help me so that they can start collecting coral again?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001350	Thank you for accepting.{nl}First, that lieutenant doesn't want to receive anything besides the corals for tributes.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001351	Eventually, we will have to get rid of the monsters so that the villagers can gather corals.{nl}You are the only one I can trust, please get rid of them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001352	I hope this clears things up...{nl}In case something happens, while you are taking care of it, {nl}I will send a person to look at the status of the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001353	It will be great if we could just drive out the monsters, but...{nl}Something's up.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001354	Oh, you've come back already?{nl}You're just as great as I've heard.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001355	I knew it wouldn't be that easy.{nl}It's so strange that many monsters are rushing in so quickly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001356	This is not just related to the monsters. There must be a different reason.{nl}I will investigate this seperately. Can you ask people here if they saw anything strange?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001357	You would think the Lord Lieutenant would be the first one to help, but no!{nl}He would rather waste his time threatening us... How strange.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001358	If it was just a matter of taxing additional tributes,{nl}why doesn't the Lord Lieutenant take some measures.{nl}Anyway, how did the investigation go?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001359	So as the number of monsters increased, the strange smell started to spread.{nl}Hmm...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001360	I can't think that the monsters are not related to the smell.{nl}Can you check where that smell is coming from?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001361	If we are lucky enough, we might be able to find the source of the smell.{nl}If you find it, please bring it to me. I will get rid of it right away.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001362	I am counting on you.{nl}Please check the coast for spots where the smell is coming from.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001363	The smell and the monsters...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001364	Just as I thought! In the contents of the pouch was a powder that allures monsters.{nl}Somebody must have deliberately used them to draw the monsters in.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001365	If the smell disappears, there will be no reason for the monsters to go crazy.{nl}Can you dig out the same pouches from the pit?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001366	I will find out more about the pouch in the meantime.{nl}I don't know yet whether it someone left it on accident or on purpose.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001367	Oh my god... This many...{nl}I can see why so many monsters are being drawn in.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001368	Someone is definitely disturbing the coral harvesting.{nl}I don't know why, but whoever behind it must be evil.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001369	Yes.{nl}I told you that the Lord Lieutenant is little strange.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001370	It would've been quite efficient if the Lord Lieutenant would personally go out and defeat the monsters.{nl}Even if this delays the tribute delivery a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001371	Yet, he didn't do it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001372	If he knows defeating the monsters is a waste of time...{nl}I think everything is coming together, now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001373	If what I am thinking is correct, the Lord Lieutenant will try to steal the tributes.{nl}However we don't have the evidence to support that claim.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001374	Alright... Let's answer our suspicions right now. Do we lure the suspect out?{nl}I want you to be responsible for the most important role.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001375	I've told the Lord Lieutenant in advance.{nl}The smell was spreading badly in the pit, making it unable to bear.{nl}I've gotten rid of the source and he thanked me for that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001376	In the meantime, please hide with the mayor.{nl}Of course, the soldier who will catch the culprit should join. {nl}He should act like an observer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001377	Of course, we can't rule out that some of the soldiers may have had a hand in this...{nl}But, you don't have to worry since Basilius is reliable and a very close friend of mine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001378	Anyway, since the Lord Lieutenant found out that all the pouches were removed...{nl}He will appear again and bury the pocket.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001379	Let's strike all at once, then.{nl}I will block the retreat route in case something happens. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001380	I am counting on you then.{nl}When you go, I will start my task as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001381	You're safe.{nl}Don't worry, the Lord Lieutenant was caught with the villagers.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001382	What a cruel and cunning man. Cowardly and dishonorable as well. {nl}He also ratted other soldiers out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001383	As I expected, they were stealing the tributes.{nl}They lured the monsters and began to steal in earnest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001384	He was blinded by greed and endangered everyone...{nl}I am well acquainted with the lord. Let me take the other soldiers to her.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001385	Due to your help, I was able to keep to the schedule and start picking up the corals again.{nl}Thank you so much. You've saved us and the villagers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001386	After you have removed all the pouches from the Lhu'uvik Coral Reef,{nl}the number of monsters have decreased quite significantly.{nl}Such a blessing... It's truly a blessing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001387	But what if some pouches are still out there...{nl}The monsters are coming more slowly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001388	Thank you.{nl}You keep helping us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001389	You are a godsend to us.{nl}Without you, we would have turned into refugees once again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001390	You found them all? {nl}What a relief.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001391	Hmm, maybe... This is just an idea,{nl}but how about we throw the powder from the pouches away from the pit?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001392	Then, the monsters will be directed there. Right?{nl}Can you help us out?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001393	Near the Atskiles Cay would be the ideal spot.{nl}Godspeed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001394	As mayor, it's embarrassing, but I almost gave up on everything.{nl}Whatever it is, I think we made the right choice with staying put.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001395	A large number of monsters came? {nl}Damn it... It was very effective, but it puts us in danger.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001396	I am so sorry to give you a hard task.{nl}I'll tell everyone not to touch the pouch.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001397	That coral... Where did you get it?{nl}That's called Arnim. It's a very important coral used in medicine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001398	There must be a habitat near the place where you obtained it...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001399	I am sorry, but can you look for their habitat?{nl}If you could look for the habitat of the Arnim coral, it would help the villagers a lot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001400	If you could find the habitat of the Arnim coral, it would be of great help to the villagers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001401	Nugara Sandbank?{nl}That deep... We will have hard time extracting it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001402	We better let the refugees know. We should find a way together.{nl}Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001403	I am sorry, but can you help us out?{nl}A lot of us are wounded, but we're short on medicine... {nl}Things are getting worse the longer we go without help...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001404	We've already used all the medicine the merchants could offer,{nl}and we have no way of getting any more.{nl}We can make an ointment if we have the ingredients...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001405	Please, get me Greentoshell Shell Fragments and Blue Lapasape Mosses.{nl}With those I can make an emergency ointment for the injuries.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001406	It's not a severe cut, but if we leave it, it will decay.{nl}There are many people hurt, but I can't do a thing...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001407	Thank you. Thank you so much.{nl}This will help you a lot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001408	I am sorry. I found a small box that looked like it fell from a wrecked ship...{nl}Do you know anything about it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001409	Ahah... So you don't know.{nl}This is sealed with magic so it can't be opened.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001410	Something important seems to be inside...{nl}Can you help me open the box?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001411	The ship that this box was on probably also has the device to unseal it.{nl}But we have only found the box. So, we have no idea from which ship it came from.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001412	It must be buried somewhere around the wrecked ship or the area near it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001413	What could possibly be inside it for someone to go this far to seal it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001414	What is this bag?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001415	Ah, there is a small magical stone in the bag!{nl}Thank you for finding it for me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001416	What's going to come out? {nl}I hope it's some jewelry or an accessory...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001417	The Lord Lieutenant was behind all this? {nl}I would teach him a lesson myself, but the lord will do a better job.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001418	I am so sorry to disturb you...{nl}Can I ask you something?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001419	At least we can take some comfort in the fact that we don't have to be on the run again.{nl}Our normal lives will return. This is too good to be true.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001420	Now, everything is screwed up.{nl}Our coral picking is ruined, and our village is finished for...

QUEST_LV_0300_20160323_001982	You took care of all the dangerous magic circles. Talk to Lutas.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_001983	There's still work to be done, it seems.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_001984	I see everything is settled.{nl}I can only thank you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_001985	I've received the information and will proceed accordingly.{nl}Please rely that.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_001986	Thanks to you I can safely return to my hometown.{nl} Meeting you really was the greatest blessing of my life.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_001987	The demon remnants are still everywhere.{nl}It's going to take a while for the soldiers to recover...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_001988	Wizard Tulis
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_001989	Thank you for helping with my research.{nl}I can do it on my own from now on.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_001990	If we can use this, it could really help us find the goddess.{nl}Sorry for being so sensitive earlier.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_001991	Village Priest Chaleims
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_001992	The goddess have not abandoned us!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_001993	Just do as Argis says.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_001994	Villager Deailan
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_001995	We need to get some herbs growing around here to cure our people...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_001996	Villager Argis
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_001997	I waited for the day this curse would be gone...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_001998	Villager Emils
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_001999	When will the suffering end...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002000	Please, destroy the statues in Kadumel Cliff and rid us of this suffering...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002001	Jamelhan
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002002	We need medicine.{nl}Too many people are wounded and we don't have enough antiseptic.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002003	I saw some wild ginger plants on the way here, maybe we can use that.{nl}It stings a little but... It's better than nothing.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002004	They grow in Barga Base.{nl}There are many monsters there, so you'll need to be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002005	That's the only place they grow like that.{nl}But, I mean, if they're good...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002006	You brought in the good ones.{nl}Good job.{nl}We all owe you one.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002007	Soldier Guylens
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002008	S-s-stop!{nl}Are you travelling through here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002009	This area is too cold and dangerous to walk through without preparation.{nl}And... um... I'm sorry.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002010	We're offering supplies to travelers who come through here.{nl}Go inside and look for the Assistant Commander.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002011	It's been long since we've seen a traveler.{nl}You must be tired, coming all the way here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002012	Talk to the Assistant Commander to receive some supplies.{nl}Don't refuse them and... Safe travels.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002013	Ibre Plateau is a very cold, dangerous place.{nl}Without firewood to keep you warm and plenty of food, you'll have a hard time making it through your journey.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002014	Go see Supply Soldier Herntas by the bridge that goes to Uzsaldi Plateau.{nl}Tell him I sent you and he will give you some supplies.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002015	Our troops have plenty to deal with, so don't worry.{nl}Now, if you'll excuse me... {nl}Have a nice trip.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002016	Don't feel too concerned for our troops.{nl}Just worry about your own safety.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002017	Did the Assistant Commander send you?{nl}I was just... organizing these traveler supplies.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002018	The supplies are at Valaska...{nl}Wait, no.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002019	Here, take these supplies.{nl}They'll be of great use whilst you're travelling through the Plateau.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002020	Uh... Oh. I'm sorry, would you go back to the Assistant Commander?{nl}There's something missing. Talon will tell you about it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002021	Herntas sent you?{nl}Ah... I see. Can't be helped, then.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002022	The rest of the supplies aren't organized yet, you see.{nl}It really can't be helped.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002023	I guess it's best if you go get the rest of the supplies yourself.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002024	We have a warehouse in Valaska Hillside.{nl}Tell Supply Soldier Delyn there that I sent you and get the supplies.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002025	I'm sorry.{nl}We can't help it either.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002026	I'm sorry.{nl}I'm really sorry...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002027	I don't expect you to forgive me.{nl}I know the goddess won't easily take me to her side even when I die!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002028	But... Still, I hope you'll listen.{nl}We're going to die at the hands of the demons anyway... Just listen to me, then you can decide what to do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002029	After Medzio Diena, all contact from the kingdom suddenly stopped.{nl}Without news of operations or reports, the troops themselves were crushed...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002030	Then, Demon Centaurus appeared with his vassals.{nl}He said he would spare our lives if we agreed to his deal.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002031	He told us to find and kill the one called the Revelator. {nl}In return, he would keep us alive and fed...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002032	We didn't even know what a Revelator was.{nl}Besides, who would come to a dangerous place like this?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002033	We decided to take the chance and keep living.{nl}The lives of our very troops were at stake so we had no choice.{nl}We just had to survive no matter how...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002034	Some did try to escape, of course.{nl}But each one of them... was made into a gruesome example of what could happen to us...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002035	Yes... We prayed every day that no one would come...{nl}But then you... I don't know what to tell you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002036	I've lost my honor as member of the Royal Army, and my own life now.{nl}If I keep you safe, will I be able to repent...?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002037	Go.{nl}They'll come running as soon as they find out one of the vassals is dead.{nl}Go, now!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002038	Soldier Callans
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002039	You already prepared the trap?{nl}Wow...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002040	The bomb I have isn't powerful enough.{nl}If we're to set it up over there... Even without the proper calculations, I don't see it being enough.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002041	Oh, you will?{nl}Then please bring me some Black Stones from Uzsaldi Plateau.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002042	I'll be here preparing to enhance the bomb meanwhile.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002043	This bomb wasn't made to kill, you see.{nl}If we don't work on it, this will be nothing but a joke to the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002044	Oh, this is it.{nl}Just a wait a while.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002045	Finished.{nl}I had to rush it so it's not too stable, but it's definitely powerful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002046	Now, for the next step.{nl}We need to set up this bomb somewhere the demons will walk by.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002047	Will you?{nl}Let's go together, then.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002048	Be careful with it.{nl}I did manage to enhance the bomb, but since I had to rush it, it's not very stable.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002049	Thank you so much.{nl}Now... the operation begins.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002050	What are you doing? Why don't you run?{nl}We disobeyed the demons, they'll be here any second!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002051	Do you really mean it?{nl}You want us to... defeat the demons together?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002052	We were going to hurt you!{nl}I thought you would at least resent us... instead you make humbled criminals of us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002053	Alright.{nl}If I'm going to die, I might as well repent to you while I can.{nl}The thing that worries me is that... everyone is terrified of Centaurus.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002054	I realised what it is we were missing.{nl}You awoke that in us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002055	Yes... I remember now.{nl}We are the Royal Army!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002056	Never did we imagine an operation of this caliber.{nl}With someone as strong as you on our side, I'm not afraid to put my life at risk.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002057	My plan is to attract as many demons as possible to the trap to reduce their numbers.{nl}But we can't let a monster get caught instead and ruin the plan.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002058	The operation is taking place at Uzsaldi Plateau.{nl}Will you take care of the monsters around the trap?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002059	This trap wasn't easy to set, it would be a shame to see it ruined by monsters.{nl}I'm counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002060	Slowly we're getting ready to fight the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002061	First we need to lure the demons with wooden fences.{nl}The soldiers are busy with other tasks, so I want to ask you to do it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002062	My debt to you just keeps growing.{nl}You can get the fences from the supplies box in front of Herntas.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002063	If only we can make this work...{nl}We could finally escape the clutches of the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002064	Are the fences ready?{nl}Good.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002065	Now we just need Soldier Callans to set up the trap to begin the operation...{nl}He's a little late.{nl}It'd be great if you could help him, just in case.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002066	Alright. We're ready.{nl}The soldiers sent to spread false information to the demons already reported back, too.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002067	They say Centaurus is coming this way.{nl}And apparently he's furious.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002068	Everything's running smoothly.{nl}I just hope we succeed...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002069	Is it... over?{nl}I can finally return as soldier of the Kingdom... It's been so hard...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002070	I would have lived a miserable life if it weren't for you.{nl}Thank you!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002071	We might have escaped the demons, but this is far from over.{nl}They probably don't even know we're alive back in the Kingdom...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002072	We need a way to contact the Kingdom!{nl}Then we can think about going back to our families.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002073	But how do we tell them about this...{nl}It's not easy.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002074	Are you talking about Uska from Klaipeda?{nl}If so, then... please, do me the favor!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002075	Telling Uska about what happened to our troops should be enough.{nl}That and... we're ready to take responsibility for the things we did.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002076	You mean the troops were still alive?{nl}That's a relief to hear.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002077	We ought to get them back to their hometowns but...{nl}Given the urgency of their situation, we will first make sure to send them supplies.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002078	Thank you for reporting this information.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002079	Hopefully Uska will be able to help us...{nl}As for our punishment... I'm not sure.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002080	You have no idea how we feel right now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002081	Uska is sending us supplies?{nl}That's a relief. To think I can go back to my hometown too...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002082	And...{nl}No word about our punishment?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002083	You left that out on purpose?{nl}You really... I get why there's no match for the Revelators now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002084	I'm sorry... and thank you for speaking on behalf of our troops!{nl}Your favor will not be forgotten.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002085	Soldier Guylens
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002086	There's nowhere colder than this place.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002087	Thanks to you we defeated Centaurus...{nl}But his vassals are still around.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002088	Our soldiers are too exhausted from the battle.{nl}But now that we have freedom... we need to protect it at all costs...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002089	Will you really?{nl}My debt to you just keeps growing.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002090	Here we have to battle not just monsters but the freezing cold, so it's never easy.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002091	If only we can pull through this...{nl}There'll be nothing else holding us down!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002092	You brought us a lot of relief, but I'm still worried about the remaining vassals.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002093	Who're you?{nl}The monsters are coming.{nl}Aren't you going to run away like those cowardly soldiers?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002094	Me?{nl}I'm going to try and pull through it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002095	Wow, you're pretty good.{nl}Defeating that huge monster all by yourself, now that's impressive!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002096	Oh, I just remembered.{nl}I was supposed to finish my damage report but the monsters got me distractred.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002097	I'm sorry, but would you take care of the wounded miners for me?{nl}You can use the herbs from before to make the antiseptic.{nl}Sorry for the trouble.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002098	The miners are over to the left.{nl}Thank you!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002099	Soldier Andre
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002100	If we do nothing, all my fellow soldiers could die.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002101	We need to save them as soon as possible...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002102	Let's see... I don't think we have enough people for the Dimensional Stone.{nl}What do we do...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002103	There weren't enough of us to stop all the demons coming out of Kaleimas.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002104	We would have been exterminated if it weren't for Assistant Commander Vilas.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002105	How's the healing process?{nl}Looks like you talked to the miners, too.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002106	As you know, we're too short on people.{nl}Especially since the soldiers, who we need the most, all ran away in fear.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002107	If only we knew where the Dimensional Stone was, I think we can make do with the workers we have...{nl}The problem is the monsters.{nl}Nothing but an annoyance...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002108	If you help us out with this, we can do the rest.{nl}For now I marked some areas that look promising.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002109	Lezsa Hill has the highest probability.{nl}Go there and use this detector to find the Dimensional Stone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002110	Make sure to mark the spot so we can find it later.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002111	If it weren't for the monsters it would be a lot easier.{nl}As for the demons... I don't even want to talk about those.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002112	You really saved us here.{nl}Your help has been precious to the Kedoran Alliance.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002113	Oh, and I'm very grateful for your help, {nl}but please don't tell anyone about the Dimensional Stone.{nl}Last time some baron opened this weird door and... let's just say it wasn't pretty.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002114	I guess that's it...{nl}You're a Revelator, we're followers of the goddess; {nl}I'm sure we'll meet again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002115	Why did we come to this dangerous place, you wonder...{nl}First of all, I work for the Kedoran Merchant Alliance.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002116	This is actually a secret, but anyways.{nl}If I tell you this then you'll have to help us out, though.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002117	So, what do you say? It'd be great if you could help.{nl}It's all in the name of the goddess, no personal gains to be had from this.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002118	If you're a Revelator I think it's fine to tell you anyways. {nl}It's all because of the Dimensional Stone, you see.{nl}With it, you can travel between dimensions.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002119	I see you're not getting it.{nl}Neither do we, actually.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002120	We at the Kedoran Alliance are just doing as the goddess told us.{nl}She said the world needed us, so we're just fulfilling that role as best as we can.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002121	If the demons get ahold of it we know it's not gonna end well so we've been working in secret...{nl}But our workers and soldiers all ran away, in fear of the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002122	Even if we send out a letter for more personnel, it's gonna take a while.{nl}The only miner workers left are terrified as well... We're in big trouble.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002123	Good.{nl}First, would you clear out some monsters around here?{nl}We can't have another one like before coming our way.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002124	Thank you for helping the Kedoran Alliance.{nl}I knew finding the Dimensional Stone was gonna be hard. {nl}I never thought I'd have to risk my life over it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002125	I think they've calmed down now.{nl}Now, shall we start...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002126	What is it?{nl}Is it because I look like I'm doing something different from everybody else?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002127	Well of course.{nl}As the competent wizard I am, I was specifically hired by the Alliance.{nl} So yes, my work here is different.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002128	Can't you tell?{nl}I'm researching ores, of course.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002129	If you have time to be asking, why don't you be useful and help me?{nl}Oh, right.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002130	I need something similar to glass.{nl}Blue Cronewt Needler Crystals.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002131	I need to analyze the ore's components, but I can't do that without the crystals.{nl}Understood?{nl}Go on, then.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002132	I wouldn't be this mad if my bag hadn't been completely destroyed by monsters.{nl}What are you doing?{nl}Hurry and get me the crystals.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002133	The Kedoran Alliance was too slow and the monsters took over...{nl}Bad luck all over.{nl}Now, give that to me already.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002134	Let's see, hm...{nl}The Dimensional Stone is full of impurities...{nl}I wonder what they're made of...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002135	What?{nl}You want to know about the Dimensional Stone?{nl}Does that mean you were... eavesdropping earlier?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002136	Alright.{nl}I'll tell you, just tone down your voice.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002137	Jamelhan says this plain-looking stone has the power to cross dimensions.{nl}Isn't it exciting?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002138	I think that if used correctly... {nl}The Dimensional Stone can take us to the place where the goddesses are.{nl}I have no idea how to use its power, though.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002139	Since you helped me find out about the impurities in the Stone...{nl}I guess I can start to find out more about it now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002140	You aren't just gonna leave after I told you all of that, are you?{nl}Why don't you give me a hand here?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002141	These impurities can interfere with the power of the Dimensional Stone,{nl} so they need to be removed.{nl}That'll be easier if I can find out what the impurities are made of.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002142	I'm going to extract some pure magic from Magic Stones and have it react with the impurities.{nl}I should be able to infer what they're made of depending on how they react.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002143	There are some Magic Stones south of the stairs in these hills. Would you get me some?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002144	Did you bring back some stones?{nl}Or didn't you leave yet?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002145	These should be enough.{nl}I'll use the stones you brought to find out just what these impurities are.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002146	I found out what the Dimensional Stone's impurities are made of.{nl}In order to extract them, hm... It's a little complicated, but I need some materials.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002147	Luckily all I need is from monsters, which definitely aren't lacking around here.{nl}I'll give you a scroll.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002148	Use this on monsters to temporarily alter their essence, and then...{nl}you need to defeat them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002149	Collect their essence and bring it to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002150	The effects of the scroll don't last too long.{nl}It was made in a rush, so please understand.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002151	You're back. Thank you.{nl}Now I just need... some samples.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002152	I need to know what the Dimensional Stone reacts to.{nl}So I want to test it on some samples.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002153	The samples aren't a problem... The problem is the reagent. I don't have enough.{nl}Would you go to Gado Way and collect some Tini Salivary Glands?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002154	Bring them to me as soon as you get them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002155	None of this would be a problem if I still had my bag.{nl}Where are those glands? Is it gonna take long?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002156	Here they are, Tini Salivary Glands.{nl}I'm still a little short on research supplies, but I'll get by on my own from now on.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002157	This story has been told in our village since long ago.{nl}Our village was built by the workers from Kaleimas Prison, a prison nearby.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002158	Their peace didn't last long... an epidemic started to spread one day.{nl}The skin would fall off the body, it was a gruesome disease...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002159	Thankfully Maven, who was passing by, cured the disease with a holy relic...{nl}And that relic has been passed on by the people of our village ever since...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002160	But now... Not long ago, Demon Centaurus appeared with his vassals.{nl}He raised statues around the village and cursed it with a disease...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002161	We created a Purification Sphere with Maven's holy relic and succeeded in destroying some of the statues.{nl}But of course, Centaurus did not like that...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002162	We thought they would end us, but all they did was destroy the Sphere.{nl}It's as if they're observing the disease.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002163	We suffer every day...{nl}Our lives cannot end under the demons' watch, but they can't go on under it, either.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002164	Please, I beg you...{nl}Rid us of the cursed statues and the demons, and cure us of this disease.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002165	The person who defeated that group of demons... was you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002166	Oh... Arntas.{nl}I can't tell if ending the curse is possible now...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002167	Your plan is to destroy the village's surveillance spheres, right?{nl}I'm afraid we have no choice, considering our situation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002168	My body hasn't recovered yet... Please go to Dvejoti Cliff for me and collect black stones.{nl}There's a lot of monsters there so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002169	There was a demon attack and some soldiers still can't leave the base.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002170	They need to be rescued.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002171	We were all just waiting for the day we would return to the goddess...{nl}Can we really escape the curse this time?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002172	You're back.{nl}Can I have them?{nl}It's time to give them hell.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002173	There, it's finished.{nl}I had to rush it so it's a little rough; please be careful with it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002174	Just set up the bomb by the surveillance sphere and run to a safe place.{nl}I used up all the black stones on it, so there's no way to control the power.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002175	If it works, go see Priest Chaleims.{nl}We almost succeeded once, so he knows what to do next; he will let you know.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002176	I don't want to live like this anyore.{nl}If we fail again this time I'll...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002177	That was a nice explosion!{nl}Now to make the Purification Sphere before the demons get here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002178	You did it!{nl}Hurry and go to Priest Chaleims!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002179	This isn't the first time I'm making a Purification Sphere, it won't be difficult.{nl}I do require some materials, however... Would you bring me some White Spion essence?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002180	I'll stay here and prepare.{nl}If we fail this time... we'll never be able to escape this life.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002181	You did well.{nl}We have the materials now, all we need is divine energy to make the Purification Sphere.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002182	We need the divine energy from Maven's holy relic... to charge the sphere with it.{nl}Originally the sphere was in our village...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002183	But the demons took it to Sventimas Exile and Kadumel Cliff.{nl}That's how powerful Maven's divine energy was.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002184	A lot of time has passed now, the divine force in it will have weakened.{nl}It's buried under the snow, thankfully, so the demons can't see it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002185	Thank you.{nl}Artnas will give you the detection orb and absorption orb.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002186	This is the most important step of our plan...{nl}I pray for your success.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002187	To think that, once again, we're using the Maven relics...{nl}I wonder if Maven knew then?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002188	You collected the energy.{nl}That's splendid!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002189	And yet... No news of Artnas.{nl}I hope nothing serious has happened... Hmm...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002190	If you find Artnas, please come back to the village.{nl}We don't know what the demons will do if they find out we destroyed their surveillance sphere.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002191	Thankfully Arntas was just a little startled and will recover with some rest.{nl}The demons seem to have caught on to us however, it would be best to move.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002192	We'll make the Purification Sphere at the altar in Besde Shores.{nl}I will see you there.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002193	You came.{nl}The monsters and the demons seem to have found out that we're up to something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002194	Please keep an eye out while I make the Purification Sphere.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002195	Finished!{nl}The Purification Sphere is complete!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002196	All that's left now is destroying the cursed statues.{nl}Take the Purification Sphere to the statues and the divine energy within it will destroy them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002197	The problem is the statues are being guarded by an army of demons.{nl}The only one able to get pass them... is you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002198	If there's any hope left for us, that's you.{nl}Please... free us from this unbearable misery.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002199	You've done it!{nl}At last... we're free from our dreadful misery...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002200	But it's not over yet.{nl}There are three more cursed statues in Kadumel Cliff.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002201	All three must be destroyed in order to end the curse.{nl}And if the demons find out your identity, they'll only make things harder for us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002202	So please!{nl}Please... destroy the remaining statues.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002203	A bomb?{nl}With the right materials, sure, I can make a bomb.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002204	My skin is still burnt but...{nl}If this curse ever ends I'll help you with whatever you need.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002205	Really?{nl}My... The goddess did not abandon us...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002206	First we need to destroy the surveillance spheres in the village so we can move freely.{nl}They were set up by the demons to monitor us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002207	We've tried before, but were caught by the demons.{nl}But you... I know you can do it if you try.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002208	Go meet Argis at the village.{nl}He knows about bombs, he can help you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002209	What are you doing in this cursed place?{nl}Everyone in this village is suffering from a horrendous disease.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002210	I wish I could at least relieve the pain...{nl}But I'm too ill to even go looking for herbs...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002211	Do you mean it?{nl}You don't know how thankful I am...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002212	Bring me some Sikljien herbs if you can.{nl}They grow on the edge of Kadumel Cliff.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002213	I'm in so much pain... it hurts to even move.{nl}The most I can do is cool my fever with the cold breeze.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002214	I'm sick of constantly talking about how much I'm suffering.{nl}But these herbs... I'm grateful for them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002215	We're already suffering from the curse, and now the monsters...{nl}Please.{nl}I just want my mind to be at ease...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002216	I can't even escape from this village.{nl}Because of the demons...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002217	Thank you!{nl}Now if only this curse were to disappear...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002218	Eugh... Run!{nl}The demons are coming!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002219	You saved my life.{nl}Seeing you defeat all those demons... There's no way you're just a normal person.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002220	We're being mercilessly attacked by demons from Kalejimas Prison.{nl}Our troops were retreating back towards Sventimas Exile.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002221	But then we were caught in an ambush and only three of us managed to escape this way.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002222	I want to go and rescue the rest of our troops but...{nl}I'm tired from the battle and I'm wounded...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002223	You say you're going to save our troops?{nl}That's extremely brave of you but...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002224	{nl}We're incredibly outnumbered!{nl}Do you still want to go...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002225	{nl}Alright.{nl}Our troops will be at the Smekla Base, unable to move.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002226	The way to the Base is occupied by demons, so be careful.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002227	You're my only hope now.{nl}Please... save our troops.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002228	Assistant Commander Vilas
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002229	A civilian?{nl}How does a civilian end up here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002230	Who are you?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002231	I hope everyone's safe...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002232	I see. Andre...{nl}By the way, did you see anything that looks like a black wall on your way here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002233	You passed through the black wall?{nl}How on earth did you do that?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002234	We're can't move from here because we couldn't pass over that wall.{nl}We'll never get away from here unless we find a way.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002235	We need to know what that wall is so we can either destroy it or break through it.{nl}So we sent Scout Boas to the Lamdyti Workshop.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002236	If you help Boas, we can find out a lot faster.{nl}Please do me that favor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002237	Scout Boas
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002238	Are you a demon?!{nl}Reveal yourself!!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002239	Oh, you were sent by Assistant Commander Vilas?{nl}But... how did you pass through the black wall...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002240	I mean, that's not important now.{nl}But that black wall... it's definitely strange.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002241	I saw some demons guarding an unknown magic device down the road south of the Lamdyti Workshop.{nl}I wonder if that has anything to do with it...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002242	I did try to blow it up with a bomb, but it didn't even budge.{nl}I think we need something more powerful.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002243	I'll go and get more bombs.{nl}Meanwhile, will you gather some black stones?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002244	The black stones around here are good for enhancing bombs.{nl}Please do me that favor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002245	You got the stones.{nl}I'll get them ready in no time.{nl}Just wait a little while.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002246	I think they're powerful enough now.{nl}Now, to destroy the magic device.{nl}You go first, I'll catch up soon.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002247	I think this time we can destroy it.{nl}The thing is... what if the problem is not the magic device?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002248	I knew it!{nl}There's no way that would survive my bombs.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002249	I wonder if the wall is gone now... We should go back to the troops!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002250	You're just who I wanted to see!{nl}The black wall disappeared and we're ready to retreat.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002251	Are we out now...?{nl}Thanks to you we all managed to retreat in safety.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002252	Losing to the demons in Steel Heights was a shame but...{nl}At least we get to live to see tomorrow.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002253	By the way...{nl}Are you perhaps headed to Kalejimas Prison?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002254	Be careful if go that way.{nl}The demons who nearly finished us all came from there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002255	Anyways, I have to thank you.{nl}May the grace of the goddess be with you!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002256	Every time the wind blows it feels like my flesh is being ripped apart.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002257	I'm suddenly reminded of my parents' potato dumplings.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002258	Soldier Hyrance
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002259	How much longer will we have to stay here...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002260	Soldier Kuijlen
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002261	This unbearable cold is a bigger enemy to us than the monsters themselves.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002262	This place is unbearably cold and full of dangerous monsters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002263	Soldier Heulen
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002264	How much longer do we have to stay...? I want to go home now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002265	The monsters, the cold... I'm so exhausted.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002266	I feel extremely thankful and sorry for the soldiers who have endured this far.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002267	I'm so grateful to these soldiers who always follow my orders even in these harsh conditions.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002268	If we didn't do as the demons said we'd be dead by now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002269	Being threatened by the demons was really hard on us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002270	We were determined to refuse when the demons offered to give us supplies in exchange for killing the Revelator, but when they threatened to kill us instead if we didn't do it, we had no choice but to obey.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002271	We wanted to resist the demons, but we knew that we couldn't defeat them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002272	We didn't want to kill anyone... {nl}But we also didn't want to die.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002273	Now we're as good as dead anyway.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002274	You should run while you still can.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002275	I'm really sorry. We would be dead if we had refused to obey the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002276	If only we weren't short on supplies, this wouldn't have happened...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002277	After we accepted the demons' orders, we prayed that no one would come to Ibre Plateau.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002278	We're just as good as dead to the demons now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002279	When we stopped getting supplies, I wanted to run away. {nl}But I couldn't bear to leave my fellow soldiers behind.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002280	We'd be dead if we hadn't obeyed the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002281	I wonder why the Assistant Commander wants to see us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002282	What does the Assistant Commander want to say to us?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002283	The Assistant Commander must have something important to say to us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002284	It sounds like the Assistant Commander has made an important decision.{nl}We'll have to go and see him.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002285	I think the Assistant Commander made a decision.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002286	I wonder why the Assistant Commander wants to see us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002287	We're the Kedoran Merchant Alliance.{nl}We supplied materials to the Great Cathedral, the Mage Tower, the Great Goddess Statue in Fedimian, and many other historical construction projects.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002288	You could say we're the backbone of history itself.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002289	Everything we thrive for is the will of the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002290	Mine Worker
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002291	I came all the way here on the promise of a high pay...{nl}I had no idea it would be this dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002292	I wouldn't have applied if I knew how dangerous this place was...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002293	They didn't even hire a soldier to protect us, how can they ask us to work here?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002294	I managed to survive the monster attack, but some experimentation tools were destroyed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002295	If it weren't for that attack I wouldn't be having such a hard time right now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002296	We managed to ward off the demons earlier but if they attack again we'll be completely exterminated.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002297	We don't have enough soldiers to survive another attack from the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002298	The black wall disappeared. We're able to retreat now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002299	We should leave before the demons attack again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002300	Right, right. Are you by chance the Revelator?{nl}I heard that someone called the Revelator came to Fedimian and is helping other people.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002301	As expected.{nl}I can see why you're so talented now.{nl}It seems the goddesses haven't abandoned us yet!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002302	The smell and the monsters...{nl}I think I'm on to something.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002303	Dievdirbys Asel
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002304	You... I don't think we've met before.{nl}Sorry for being so direct, but can I ask you a favor?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002305	I was attacked by monsters on my way here.{nl}I should have chased them away but... I can't move now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002306	Oh! Thank you.{nl}You can bring me some herbs then. I now a type that's good for wounds.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002307	Although I'm not too familiar with this area.{nl}But the owl sculptures in Zaliavin Valley should know where to find those herbs.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002308	I hate that I can't move because of the monsters...{nl}And that I have to ask this favor to a stranger... I'm sorry.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002309	The broken owl sculptures you see around here... They don't answer when you talk to them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002310	You say the owl sculptures are broken and don't answer?{nl}What on earth happened there...?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002311	I'm actually here by request of the Dievdirbys Master.{nl}I was tasked with checking the condition of the statues, so I come here about once a month.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002312	I don't think they would be attacked by monsters...{nl}Strange. I should go there myself.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002313	The owl sculptures aren't answering.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002314	If these statues aren't repaired soon, the number of lost spirits will only grow bigger.{nl}But I'm barely able to stand as it is... This is some problem we have here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002315	I'm so sorry.{nl}You're the only one I can depend on right now so I have to ask.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002316	Please do me this favor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002317	This is terrible.{nl}I feel a strange energy, too...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002318	I'll have a look; please wait here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002319	Uh? Why are there cuts on the backs of the statues...?{nl}There's an evil energy coming from here. This is not the work of monsters...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002320	I wonder if it's a curse...{nl}It looks like the evil energy is attracting monsters to this area.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002321	This won't be easy, it seems.{nl}It's hard enough to deal with evil energy, but the big problem is repairing the statues.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002322	Not only do they have cuts, there's broken parts here and there that need to be fixed.{nl}Even with the right materials... the chances look slim.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002323	Thank you for your precious help.{nl}I'll ask you to gather some sticky liquid and broken bows from monsters nearby.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002324	I'm still very wounded, but I can deal with the repair job.{nl}What kind of Dievdirbys would I be if I couldn't?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002325	Oh, you got them.{nl}I'll just tend to the cuts and broken parts and we can move on to the purification.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002326	My body feels like it's about to return to the goddess...{nl}I just hope I have enough strength to repair the statues.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002327	I've never seen anything like this.{nl}The evil energy isn't disappearing. This could be a curse more powerful than anything I know...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002328	I need to observe the other statues to look for clues, but it's impossible like this.{nl}May I ask you to gather some herbs for me that I can use as a painkiller?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002329	Thank you, I'll trust you to do it.{nl}You can bring me some Yellow Sapous, they're found on the north side of the valley.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002330	I'd get proper treatment if only the statues were okay...{nl}This was all very unexpected.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002331	Thank you. For all your favors.{nl}I think, however... there's something strange here...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002332	I've seen many statues destroyed by demons or broken by monsters...{nl}But none had this awful curse that won't disappear.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002333	I should check the other statues, anyways.{nl}I can move to some extent now, I just pray that the goddess will help me make it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002334	I'm going to rest for a while before I head to Miglos Hill, what about you?{nl}But you don't have to worry about me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002335	Will you?{nl}I'm grateful to have someone as talented as you accompany me, of course!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002336	If you can, go and clear out some monsters on the way to Miglos Hill.{nl}Thank you!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002337	I'll follow you once the painkiller takes effect.{nl}I'll meet you at Miglos Hill, then.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002338	Cuts. And that evil energy...{nl}This owl sculpture is in the same condition as the other.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002339	You would need serious skill to make these cuts.{nl}And to handle such powerful evil energy, too.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002340	Who could have done this?{nl}Could it be a demon... or someone with other intents?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002341	For now I'll try and purify it.{nl}Will you take care of the other owl sculptures?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002342	Thank you.{nl}You can go to the Raucous Owl Sculpture in Skardus Hill.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002343	We'll have a big problem at hands if that statue is affected by evil energy too...{nl}Good luck.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002344	Raucous Owl Sculpture
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002345	Did Asel sent you here?{nl}What a relief!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002346	I was worried since none of the other statues are responding; I think they're asleep.{nl}Oh, right... I just remembered something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002347	Not long ago my friends said they saw a strange little girl.{nl}She had an odd energy to her.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002348	I think that's when it happened.{nl}I wonder if the girl has anything to do with them being asleep.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002349	This is going to take a while...{nl}Please take care of the Raucous Owl Sculpture in Skardus Hill.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002350	A girl, you say... I have no idea.{nl}I don't think she would be responsible for this, though.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002351	Maybe the owl sculpture in the training camp knows something.{nl}Meet me at the Grynas Training Camp.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002352	Can my friends ever wake up again?{nl}I want to at least protect them from the monsters... Would you help me just a little bit?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002353	Thank you!{nl}I'll make some crystals that can protect my friends.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002354	A little over Skardus Hill you'll find Spirit Stones.{nl}They're red and sparkly.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002355	Please collect some stones and also ritual pouches used by Stoulets.{nl}I need the powder inside.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002356	Asel can wake them up, right?{nl}I hope the others won't hurt anymore.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002357	You got the materials!{nl}I'll use them to make the protective crystals.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002358	Finished.{nl}Will you put them next to my friends?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002359	Please put three crystals around each statue.{nl}There's bound to be monsters around so you'll have to clear them out, too.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002360	Luckily I'm here isolated and nothing happened to me.{nl}Who could have done such a thing...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002361	Thank you.{nl}The crystals will protect my friends for a while so I can put my heart at ease.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002362	You did say that there was evil energy around the cuts on the statues, right?{nl}They must have been bitten by monsters...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002363	Even with the crystals protecting them, wouldn't it be better to get rid of everything harmful?{nl}I'm just worried, you see...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002364	Really? Thank you!{nl}Please clear out some monsters around the statues, then.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002365	Luckily I was left unscathed but...{nl}My friends aren't that vulnerable, who could have done that to them?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002366	Thank you.{nl}I hope my friends wake up soon...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002367	You're here.{nl}This is the place where Dievdirbys have been training since the old days.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002368	Not long ago, however, it was attacked by Sequoia.{nl}The very Sequoia created by Tesla, the one that was taken by evil energies.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002369	After they took everyone to a safe place and began to take care of the wounded, this area became empty.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002370	I'll ask the other Dievdirbys about the owl sculptures...{nl}Meanwhile, please have a look at the statue.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002371	If I remember correctly, it will be at the Bevertis Crossroads.{nl}I will see you later.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002372	Hasty Owl Sculpture
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002373	Help!{nl}I think all my friends are asleep, they're not responding...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002374	Asel is here too?{nl}He must know, then! About the girl, that is.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002375	A girl was here not long ago... She had a really warm energy.{nl}But after meeting with her, all my friends suddenly fell asleep...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002376	You should go see the Lonely Owl Sculpture.{nl}She's on a high spot at the end of a broken path, she could have seen something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002377	We can only hope that the information we need is here.{nl}There are too many things that don't seem right.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002378	Did you find something?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002379	All the owl sculptures that saw the girl are now asleep... Hm.{nl}I'm afraid the Dievdirbys here don't know much, either.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002380	I don't think the girl did anything wrong.{nl}Her energy... it was so warm, you see.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002381	I'll ask the Dievdirbys if any of them saw the girl.{nl}Will you go see the Lonely Owl Sculpture at the broken path?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002382	Lonely Owl Sculpture
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002383	St-stay away!{nl}Or else I'll...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002384	What? Dievdirbys Asel sent you here?{nl}I was so scared...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002385	A girl... That's odd.{nl}I should investigate a little more.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002386	Oh, that girl... I know about her.{nl}Not long ago I saw a girl being chased by someone around here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002387	It was a man I'd never seen before.{nl}He looked so evil and terrifying... I was really very scared...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002388	That's about the time my friends started to fall asleep.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002389	From up here I can't see that well because of the trees but...{nl}My friends down the road maybe know more than I do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002390	You can follow this path down to Grubus Highway.{nl}I don't know if that statue is asleep though... I'm a little worried.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002391	There was a man chasing the girl?{nl}Then one of them must have put the curse on the owl sculptures.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002392	Now that I think of it, that evil energy would have been difficult to endure for a human...{nl}But we should keep all possibilities open.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002393	The owl sculpture is covered in cuts and... also sleeping.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002394	My friends started to fall asleep not long after I saw that man...{nl}I was really scared then...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002395	The Grubus Highway owl sculpture is also asleep... Hm.{nl}This won't do. We need to do something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002396	Tesla told me about something called a purifying sculpture, but it's complicated...{nl}If I make the sculpture, will you find some materials for the purification?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002397	Fight some Black Old Kepas and get their stems.{nl}Then meet me in front of the Sleeping Owl Sculpture.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002398	You're back faster than I thought.{nl}Just wait a while. This may be complicated but it won't take long.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002399	The only thing is... I don't think I can do this alone in my current state.{nl}I can do the hard part, but you'll have to support me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002400	All you need to do is purify any evil energy with the sculpture.{nl}Meanwhile I'll block the places where the energy is coming from.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002401	This is not the time to be talking!{nl}Please, the purification!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002402	I'm sorry. It looks like I failed...{nl}Just what are those cuts...? I need to find another way.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002403	I should go see the last training camp owl sculpture.{nl}I'll go first; you follow me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002404	Fortunately... this statue is not asleep because of the curse.{nl}It must be worn out from using too much divine force.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002405	It should be fine if we replenish its power.{nl}I hope this time we can find out something about the cuts...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002406	I'm going to give you an orb and I want you to fill it with the life force of defeated monsters.{nl}With the help of the orb the statue should recover fast.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002407	There are no cuts or evil energy.{nl}But the statue seems fast asleep.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002408	It should be fine if we replenish its power.{nl}I hope this time we can find out something about the cuts...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002409	Good, thank you.{nl}We should be able to wake up the owl sculpture now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002410	Did... Did I fall asleep?{nl}The girl and the man? What happened to them?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002411	So, that day... Yes, that's right.{nl}It was a dark night.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002412	A man I'd never seen was chasing a girl.{nl}I'm sure he was a human, but his energy was like a demon's...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002413	It was really scary.{nl}The girl was right in front of me when the man almost caught her... then, something strange happened.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002414	The girl, she...{nl}She used the divine force in me to push the man far away.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002415	That's when I lost all my strength and fell asleep...{nl}I don't know what happened next...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002416	It's still all very unclear.{nl}But I think we can assume it wasn't the girl who hurt the statues.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002417	Still... something doesn't fit.{nl}All the statues said that the man was human...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002418	I doubt that a human could endure such powerful evil energy.{nl}They could be using some sort of unusual method to do it...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002419	Our last hope is the owl sculpture on the Hills.{nl}Meet me there. This time we must get a definitive answer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002420	I was really scared.{nl}Such an evil energy... I never felt anything like that.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002421	I can't believe it was coming from a human...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002422	Trainee Leryd
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002423	We're not in our best condition right now.{nl}A lot of trainees got hurt during the Sequoia attack.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002424	Still, we can't stop our training, right?{nl}I'm sorry, but could I ask you a small favor?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002425	Thank you!{nl}I want to ask you to collect some items from monsters around this area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002426	Everything you can collect will be very useful to us!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002427	I never thought I would one day see the Sequoia with my own two eyes.{nl}And we thought we could put our training to use and face it but.... It was horrible.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002428	You're back already?{nl}Amazing. These will be very useful for our training!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002429	Dievdirbys Ruthalen
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002430	I'm just really upset.{nl}First there was the Sequoia attack, now the Ridimeds are wreaking havoc.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002431	They're very cunning and always move in groups so it's hard to catch them.{nl}I'm sorry, but would you help?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002432	Thank you for helping.{nl}They actually don't show up that easily, so we might need some preparation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002433	I'm talking about a bait, specifically the fruits that Ridimeds like.{nl}I'll stay here and prepare; you can collect the fruits from piles of greenery. They'll have a peculiar scent.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002434	Crafting wood, materials...{nl}They'll bite anything they see, even people.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002435	We'll show them right this time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002436	This should do.{nl}Let's set up the bait for the Ridimeds now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002437	I'll start cooking the fruits over fire like I said.{nl}Please take care of any Ridimeds that show up.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002438	Thank you for your help.{nl}I can feel safe for a while now knowing all the Ridimeds in the area are gone.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002439	Did you happen to see two old carving knives around here?{nl}They're very dear to me, you see...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002440	Oh! That's the knife!{nl}But the other one...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002441	It was a gift from my parents, I really can't lose it...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002442	If you find that knife, please return it to me.{nl}My name will be carved on the handle.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002443	Yes! That's my knife!{nl}Thank you for bringing my precious knife back to me. Thank you!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002444	Dievdirbys Aisol
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002445	Oh, Asel told me about you.{nl}He is really impressed with your talent.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002446	Things are a bit rough here because of the Sequoia attack.{nl}If that's okay, I would like to ask for your help... What do you say?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002447	Wow, thank you.{nl}What happened here was... well, the Sequoia attacked our training camp.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002448	Did you know?{nl}The Sequoia was created by Tesla, the Dievdirbys Master, to protect the owl sculptures.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002449	But it was corrupted by the evil energy at Karolis Springs.{nl}This all happened a long time ago...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002450	Now the Sequoia came with other monsters and started to wreak havoc here.{nl}And... that's about it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002451	First I'll ask you to clear out some monsters around here.{nl}They came with the Sequoia and are very persistent.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002452	We don't know why the Sequoia became like this...{nl}But its evil energy looks extremely powerful.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002453	But that happened a long time ago; now the owl sculptures...{nl}I don't know. Their case looks similar, but why would this happen after such a long time?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002454	Wow... You did a great job!{nl}Now we only need to deal with the Sequoia.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002455	The Sequoia is still lurking around here.{nl}But after the last attack, I don't think we can fight that soon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002456	The truth is, we feel sorry for asking you this favor.{nl}The Sequoia is extremely dangerous. We understand if you want to refuse.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002457	Will you... be okay?{nl}The last place we saw the Sequoia was near the broken path.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002458	Hm... Right. It's still wounded from the previous attack so...{nl}Someone like you can definitely take it down. I'll wish you good luck!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002459	If it gets close to you, run away.{nl}We tried ambushing it and even then it was extremely brutal and resilient.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002460	Just try and stay safe...{nl}Do you think you can do it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002461	You did it!{nl}You defeated the Sequoia... I am in awe, really.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002462	We can finally recover in peace now.{nl}Thank you so much for all your help!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002463	Now. We hould check to see if the owl sculptures are still asleep.{nl}Let's split so we can check faster.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002464	I'll go see the owl sculpture in Siauras Valley.{nl}Please have a look at the Quiet Owl Sculpture at Susipyne Hill.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002465	Thank you.{nl}Meet me at Siauras Valley again when you're done checking.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002466	Quiet Owl Sculpture
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002467	You have divine energy in you.{nl}I heard a girl like you was here a few days ago...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002468	You want to know about the girl and a suspicious man?{nl}I don't know. I didn't see anything... I just heard about it from the other statues.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002469	I was worried since they all seemed to have fallen asleep.{nl}Did they see something they shouldn't?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002470	If Asel is here, that must be why they woke up, right?{nl}Although I'm sorry I can't be of more use to you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002471	Let's check the statues and meet at Siauras Valley again.{nl}Hopefully with good news.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002472	The sleeping owl sculptures should know?{nl}Hm... I'm sure it was that suspicious man.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002473	The way he moves is a lot like an assassin.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002474	Fortunately the statue I saw wasn't as affected by the curse.{nl}So I was able to talk to it a little bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002475	It seems the girl was chased by the suspicious man all the way here...{nl}Then she tried to use the power of the owl sculptures to keep him away.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002476	After that she headed to the Laukimo Vacant Lot.{nl}We should go there too.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002477	It's tragic... The owl sculptures...{nl}Not even I can help them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002478	There's something here. Inside the lot, that is.{nl}But the evil energy is too strong... My body can't take it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002479	You don't seem to be affected, though.{nl}It could be the Purifying Sculpture protecting you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002480	I think you can go inside the vacant lot.{nl}Please... go and see where this evil energy is coming from.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002481	Sorry.{nl}I wish I could follow you but I can't move any further...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002482	I can't take it much longer...{nl}Please hurry...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002483	What's this... a dagger and a broken amulet.{nl}I need to have a look at these.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002484	I'm not sure but I feel traces of a special protection spell on this amulet.{nl}The dagger just gives off a powerful evil energy...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002485	Right. With this amulet, you wouldn't have to be a demon to use the dagger.{nl}But for some reason the amulet broke... and they abandoned both objects here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002486	With an evil energy this strong, I don't think even the Purifying Sculpture can help.{nl}We may need to call Tesla.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002487	I feel so sorry for the owl sculptures inside...{nl}We can only try and stop such a thing from happening again...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002488	Hm... If even Asel can't handle this energy...{nl}There's not much the Purifying Sculpture can do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002489	I'll carve another sculpture just in case.{nl}Please wait.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002490	I don't how much longer I can take it, please hurry...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002491	If the evil energy is too powerful, the Purifying Sculpture alone won't be able to stop it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002492	Here. Take this.{nl}It will help the Purifying Sculpture.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002493	Are you saying Tesla created a new sculpture?{nl}Hm... This method is... Clearly I still need to train more...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002494	Now. The dagger is one thing, but the vacant lot is full of evil energy too.{nl}Go there. Get rid of the evil energy all at once.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002495	I reckon this sculpture will do.{nl}I hope Asel won't be too hard on himself...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002496	Tesla's sculpture is impressive.{nl}I can already feel the evil energy disappear...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002497	Now. I'll prepare for the dagger purification.{nl}Will you collect the Yellow Griba Pollen?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002498	Thank you.{nl}I'll start the procedure as soon as you come back.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002499	Using the Purifying and Suppressing Sculptures together will work for sure.{nl}This time we'll definitely get to the end of it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002500	Thank you.{nl}This should be enough.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002501	Okay. I'll start the purification procedure now.{nl}The clash of divine and evil energies is going to attract monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002502	I'll leave the monsters up to you.{nl}Please take care of them while I finish the procedure.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002503	It's a success!{nl}I've erradicated the evil energy...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002504	Not everything is back to normal, though.{nl}The owl sculptures are still asleep.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002505	We also need to find out the one responsible for this...{nl}And the girl.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002506	There is one owl sculpture left.{nl}Its name is Friendly Owl Sculpture... it lives on the Stabdymo Shore.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002507	I wonder if it knows the whereabouts of the girl or the suspicious man.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002508	I'm... so sorry.{nl}I really need to rest. Using so much divine force has tired me...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002509	I trust you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002510	A girl and a suspicious man?{nl}No one's been here in a while.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002511	Hm... Come to think about it, I did see a pillar of light coming from the lot a few days ago.{nl}I'm not sure if that's related or not.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002512	The statues at the Laukimo Vacant Lot should know...{nl}Why don't you go there?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002513	Oh... That's why they weren't responding...{nl}Who could have done it...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002514	We can't let this happen again.{nl}There is a way to look into their memories, at least part of them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002515	Go and ask Asel to carve another owl sculpture.{nl}I'll impart some of my power onto it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002516	That should allow me to peek into the others' memories.{nl}And don't forget to purify any evil energy first.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002517	Looking into the memories of the owl sculptures...{nl}I see. So there is a way!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002518	I can make a small owl sculpture, no problem.{nl}The purification is going to be a little harder, though...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002519	Here's the statue. Please take it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002520	The problem is me.{nl}The divine power I used to purify the dagger hasn't recovered yet...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002521	There's no other way. I'll carve the statue.{nl}Meanwhile, I'm sorry but I'm going to ask you to fill this orb with life force again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002522	I'm counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002523	If only I hadn't been attacked by monsters before I met you...{nl}I'm a digrace.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002524	You're back already!{nl}Give me the statue.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002525	I'll impart some of our power onto it.{nl}After you take it, you'll be able to see some of our memories.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002526	I guess... I'll never see my friends again.{nl}I hopes this at least helps those who survived.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002527	In all my life I had never seen something so mystical.{nl}I wonder what the mysterious power is...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002528	In the end we still don't know who the two men are.{nl}But considering the power of their evil energy... Someone so strong is surely well-known.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002529	And thank you for everything.{nl}If it weren't for you, the owls here would be asleep forever without knowing what happened.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002530	I'm going to investigate this issue a bit further.{nl}May the grace of the goddess bless your way.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002531	The... the broken statues.{nl}They must have been bitten by monsters with evil energy, right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002532	I heard the monsters were attacking owls in other forests...{nl}I'm scared that will happen here too.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002533	Would you clear out some monsters around here?{nl}I know it's not a definitive solution, but it would make me feel safer...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002534	I used to feel safe with all the Dievdirbys around...{nl}Now I'm really worried for the future.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002535	Thank you!{nl}I sure hope you and the Dievdirbys find a solution soon...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002536	I have a favor to ask you.{nl}It seems like the spirits aren't following me anymore.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002537	It's all because of the Sequoia.{nl}I think the spirits are too scared...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002538	I need to guide the spirits before the demons get them...{nl}Would you help me with that?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002539	First, collect some Green Sakmoli leaves.{nl}Their scent comforts the hearts of the spirits.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002540	The Sequoia... Maybe the spirits were too afraid of it.{nl}But if they don't return to the goddess, even scarier things will happen...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002541	This should be enough.{nl}Let's try and guide the spirits now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002542	If you see a wandering spirit, burn the leaves.{nl}Their scent will attract the spirits to you, so you can guide them to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002543	Please take good care of the spirits.{nl}Make sure they find their way to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002544	Someone once said birth and conclusion are the values remembered in life.{nl}That's why I want to send the spirits to the goddess in safety. Thank you for helping.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002545	When will my friends wake up...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002546	A lot of people were wounded in the attack and a lot of our things were destroyed, too.{nl}It's a disgrace...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002547	Many souls were startled by the Sequoia and lost their way...{nl}But if they don't return to the goddess, scarier things are going happen...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002548	The sleeping Owl Sculptures should know something.{nl}Asel can wake them up, right?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002549	It's awfully quiet now that most of my friends are asleep...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002550	So. The statue is finished and the orb is ready.{nl}With the power from this orb, purification should be quick.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002551	Go and take some power from the Friendly Owl Sculpture.{nl}Let's carry on with the purification.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002552	I'm worried. What happened...?{nl}My friends suddenly fell asleep...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002553	It looks like someone is fighting.{nl}What's happening?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002554	Loremaster Daroul
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002555	Thank you for helping me!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002556	Those monsters were more dangerous than I expected...{nl}Lucky you could defeat them so easily, traveler.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002557	Oh, I didn't introduce myself.{nl}My name is Daroul, I'm a loremaster serving Goddess Jurate.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002558	Maybe... you don't know what we do exactly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002559	Feel free to ask me anything.{nl}There's probably a lot that you don't know.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002560	Did I satisfy your curiosity?{nl}Unfortunately Goddess Jurate seems to have been mostly forgotten... It's a shame.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002561	I just wish that Goddess Jurate would answer us for a moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002562	We heard the sea had turned into land and came as fast as we could...{nl}We had to prepare everything by ourselves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002563	One of our members is looking for a place to build an altar...{nl}Me, I'm preparing an offering for the goddess, but we're very short-handed, you see.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002564	So please.{nl}Think of this as your destiny chosen by the goddess and give us a hand?{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002565	Thank you.{nl}First, you could go to the Lamdonas Coral Reef and find some blue corals.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002566	Our other member came while you where collecting the corals.{nl}They found a spot with concentrated sea energy and are going to build the altar there, they said.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002567	I'm going to go help them; will you come along?{nl}If the ceremony is successful, we might just see Goddess Jurate again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002568	I feel reassured now.{nl}They said the energy is concentrated at the Dellam Sandbank; come see me there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002569	Loremaster Berta
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002570	Oh, hello!{nl}You're the one who helped brother Daroul.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002571	These are just what we need!{nl}They're in good condition, too.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002572	They'll make a wonderful offering for the goddess.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002573	We need the blue corals found at the Lamdonas Coral Reef.{nl}The area has a lot of monsters though, so be careful...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002574	It looks like a normal stone. Let me try the holy water.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002575	We need the altar back as soon as possible...{nl}But the sea energy seems to have made the Crabil even more powerful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002576	Thank you for helping with our ceremony for Goddess Jurate.{nl}Other loremasters should start gathering here soon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002577	I believe that someday Goddess Jurate will once again hear our prayers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002578	Thanks to you we managed to speed things up.{nl}We should hurry and finish building the altar now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002579	Our offering ceremony to the goddess was possible all thanks to you.{nl}I don't know what we would do if it were just me and Berta...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002580	I pray that the goddess will once again look over us soon.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002581	The altar is damaged, and the offerings are completely ruined.{nl}We need to hurry and prepare everything again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002582	It's hard for me to move because of the wounds...{nl}But I need to have a look at the owl sculptures...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002583	I'll trust you with the coral.{nl}Joana will do a much better job at crafting it than me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002584	Sigh... Looks like the Ridimeds messed with the dry wood again.{nl}I even threw away all the wood I had stored because of the Sequoia; I don't know what to do...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002585	A lot of people were wounded in the attack and a lot of our things were destroyed, too.{nl}I need to look for my missing knife if things settle.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002586	Thank you for defeating the Crabil.{nl}Thanks to you we can now carry on with the ceremony.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002587	Thank you for finding my knife.{nl}Now I can really focus on my work.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002588	Did you get the handicraft from Joana?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002589	What a beautiful piece.{nl}Incredible handicraft work...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002590	Thank you.{nl}I think the goddess will be very pleased with this offering.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002591	A few days ago the Sequoia and the monsters decided to wreak havoc here.{nl}Most of our group fled to a safe place, the rest are here dealing with the damage.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002592	Thanks to you we can focus on getting back on our feet.{nl}We need to get everything ready so the trainees can start practicing again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002593	Apart from the statue on the Broken Path, no one else is reponding...{nl}What could have happened to the others?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002594	What could have happened to the others...?{nl}And who is that evil man...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002595	Thank you for helping.{nl}As soon as things settle here we need to take care of those Ridimeds.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002596	Who was that man surrounded by evil energy?{nl}And what could have happened to the girl he was chasing?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002597	It's getting so quiet here.{nl}My friends all fell asleep, one by one...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002598	Exhausted Owl Sculpture
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002599	The girl came running to me and I felt an unexplicable warmth in her...{nl}Then the girl used my power to chase away the suspicious man...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002600	I might have let her borrow too much of my power... I fell asleep right away.{nl}What happened to her?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002601	The forest feels awfully quiet today, now that most of my friends are asleep...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002602	I sure hope nothing like this ever happens again.{nl}I don't want to lose my friends...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002603	Let's go back to Dievdirbys Asel first and talk about this.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002604	Let's look for the statue at the Grubus Highway like the Lonely Owl Sculpture said.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002605	Follow Dievdirbys Asel to the Grynas Hills!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002606	Follow Dievdirbys Asel inside the Laukimo Vacant Lot!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002607	Did you perhaps see any Dievdirbys trainees around here?{nl}I really don't know what...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002608	My friends all seem to have fallen asleep, no one is responding...{nl}It wasn't a monster attack, was it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002609	The Sequoia was terrifying that night.{nl}All of these unfortunate things keep happening...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002610	I'd never seen anything that frightening.{nl}It was like witnessing another Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002611	I'm afraid this whole ordeal was really upsetting for everyone.{nl}How can we live in this world anymore...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002612	I'm glad I at least got my carving knife back.{nl}Us Dievdirbys can do anything as long as we have our carving knives.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002613	They destroy all the tools and the wood, they even attack people.{nl}The Ridimeds, that is.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002614	Now we just need to get things sorted again...{nl}It's going to take a while even with the help of the goddess, though.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002615	The girl... is she alright?{nl}And that man...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002616	It looks like a regular stone.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003197	It doesn't matter which demon as long as it from around here.{nl}You wouldn't have a difficult time locating one, the place is crawling with them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003198	I am an ordinary man to begin with..{nl}And me being dead, well, is not helping at all.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003199	It's all my fault, I should have kept it more safely.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003200	Let's see.{nl}I think it's enough.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003201	Now, if you need me, use Teal Magic Stone at a safe place.{nl}I cannot get inside dangerous places like barrier.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003202	To dispell a demon barrier, you must destroy Mandara.{nl}It is a powerful demon protecting Kalejimas Visiting Room.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003203	On top of that, a demon barrier strengthens Mandara.{nl}However, there is a way to deactivate a barrier albeit temporarily.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003204	Secret device in the isolated area has a Magic Control Scroll hidden inside.{nl}With that, King Kadumel can be defeated.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003205	In order to unlock secret device in the isolated area, you must match the brightness of the lights on both sides..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003206	The escape plan can only be used by him, no one else. {nl}Now, that is a mark of a true tyrant, always thinking of escape strategies. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003207	As you can tell by secret devices, what kind of a person King Kadumel was like.{nl}Nota trusting one, I can tell you that much.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003208	Do you have it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003209	You are the Revelator selected by the goddess.{nl}You will get the revelation.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003210	The spell that you want to suppress must be inscribed in Magic Control Scroll first.{nl}No ordinary method can do the job..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003211	The demons have very similar spells among themselves.{nl}So, it doesn't have to be from King Kadumel.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003212	Defeat the demons and inscribe its spell on the scroll. {nl}It's much safer and wiser than charging straight to King Kadumel.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003213	Your safety comes first.{nl}For safely delivering the revelation to you is the sole reason why I am staying here instead of the bossoms of the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003214	The Magic Control Scroll will not completely subdue King Kadumel.{nl}In Kalejimas Prison, there are five demon barriers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003215	The Magic Control Scroll seems to be ready to go.{nl} All that is left is the downfall of King Kadumel.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003216	Demon barriers are protecting King Kadumel from any harm.{nl}That is why we made the Magic Control Scroll.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003217	That will suppress the barriers and then you must strike King Kadumel.{nl}However, the Magic Control Scroll will not keep the barriers down completely.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003218	It will regenerate again and again.{nl}So, you have to use Magic Control Scroll every time it rises up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003219	Got it?{nl}Now, let's go and defeat King Kadumel.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003220	King Kadumel is in Offender Institution.{nl}Be careful and keep what I have told you in mind at all time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003221	King Kadumel was one of Nebulas??minions.{nl}Demon Lord Nebulas is far stronger than King Kadumel.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003222	Are you hurt?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003223	That's a relief.{nl}Now disabling demon barriers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003224	To disable demon barrier, you must go down to Supply Room.{nl}The barrier is quite strong and requires something in return. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003225	The secret device in the supply room has Orb of Dominance Magic.{nl}I believe it is the last card up King Kadumel's sleeve.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003226	Dominance Magic is a powerful magic, it is enough to dispel demon barrier.{nl}You might face a slight problem but first, let's find the orb.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003227	The secret device in the supply room can only be opened by entering a password.{nl}The problem is the memory about the password, I don't have. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003228	Perhaps, there might be a part of my soul that remembers the password... {nl}But at the moment, we have no time, we have to solve it ourselves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003229	The password is comprised of numbers. {nl}There might be some clues around the device.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003230	I should think about how to use the Orb of Dominance Magic when we acquire it.{nl}It is very powerful. A powerful magic requires something of equal worth in return.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003231	You got the Orb of Dominance Magic.{nl}Nice job. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003232	Also, I figured out a way to use Orb of Dominance Magic.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003233	I did say something about giving something in return, right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003234	Dominance Magic usually needs the user's life force to activate itself. {nl}Quite fitting for the last card in King Kadumel's sleeve.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003235	But offering the life of Revelator is not an option.{nl}Last of all, all of this is mine own fault. I should have protected the revelation..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003236	Dominance Magic requires lifeforce or something equivalent or higher. {nl}That is why... I have decided to use my own soul... I will feed Dominance Magic my soul.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003237	If it takes my entire soul, my very existence will cease to be.{nl}However, the soul is something much valuable than the lifeforce, so it will only drain a portion of my soul.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003238	But, repeat doing that, it will drain my existence completely..{nl}If giving up my existence means saving you, Revelator, I have no regret. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003239	Don't worry about me, let's just disable that demon barrier.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003240	Getting the revelation of Goddess Laima to you, Revelator, is my duty, even after death.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003241	I have died for the revelation once..{nl}I would do whatever it takes to deliver the revelation to you...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003242	Like I have said before... {nl}When my soul split, so did my memories. At my current state, helping you is a bit difficult. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003243	We need a part of my soul in Storage facility in Warehouse No. 3.{nl}To find the secret device where my soul resides in, you need two types of spell. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003244	When King Kadumel was making it, there were two types of magic stones...{nl}Unfortunately, we do not have them at the moment. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003245	One of them can be solved by your power alone, Revelator..{nl}As for the other one, we should use the power from the monsters. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003246	They are two completely different powers, it might just solve the secret device.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003247	There is a evil energy core you can get from defeating nearby monsters.{nl}It emits the power exact opposite of your own.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003248	I think the demons have not noticed our movement.{nl}This is our chance!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003249	Hmm, seems sufficient.{nl}I hope, it will work out as planned...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003250	My other soul is hiding in the secret device in Warehouse No. 3.{nl}It cannot get out of it on its own, please turn it off and let it out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003251	To turn the secret device off, you have to give two different powers into the machine on each side.{nl}One from your own. The other from the core of the evil energy.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003252	It bears repeating... {nl}Put the power of your own and the power from the monster into each side of the secret device.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003253	I hope my other soul piece has the memory regarding the revelation...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003254	Is it you who got me out? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003255	Finally, Revelator came.{nl}That means my other soul piece in the visiting room succeeded.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003256	Some of my soul pieces are captured but it's a relief that one of them at least succeeded.{nl}Revelator is here! Now, the next step can be done.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003257	You need four gems to open the secret device that contains the revelation. {nl}One of the gems is stored in this storage. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003258	I have no memory of where all the gems are nor the location of the revelation..{nl}Perhaps, my other soul piece would have that information.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003259	But fortunately, there is an instruction manual for the secret device.{nl}If you find it, we don't have to find the memory to activate the secret device.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003260	The problem is special spell is needed to read the manual.{nl}For that, we need Teal Magic Stone...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003261	Say what? That's Teal Magic Stone, right there. {nl}You came prepared, didn't you. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003262	That makes the whole thing, easy-peasy.{nl}The manual is hidden inside a pile of junk in Warehouse No. 2.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003263	Use Teal Magic Stone on the pile of junk, there will be a piece of paper levitating.{nl} That's the maual.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003264	If you find the manual, please come straight to the waiting room.{nl}I will find my other soul pieces and regain memories.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003265	Found the manual and some memories have been regained. Now things will get a bit easier. {nl}Now, let's get those gems.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003266	The King has four gems. {nl}The red one is inside the secret device in Warehouse No. 1. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003267	In order to open it, you must light three lamps.{nl}Follow the instruction on the manual to light the lamp.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003268	Two of the lamps require specific oil for each lamp..{nl}The rest can be lit with magic.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003269	It ain't exactly Homunculus summoning, just avoid getting devoured by demons and you are good to go.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003270	You lit two of them already? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003271	You truly are the revelator picked by Goddess Laima.{nl}Now, the last lamp is the trickiest lamp of them all.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003272	But for you, it won't be that hard.{nl}The last lamp is located at the Kalejimas visiting room.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003273	The last lamp will be lit if you activate all the five magic circles surrounding it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003274	One activated magic circle will affect the others..{nl}So, you have to think ahead on which one you should activate first.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003275	All these complex machineries... {nl}You cannot deny that King Kadumel was great in that respect. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003276	Then again, Nebulas has yet to find the revelation thanks to him...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003277	The lamps are all lit. All that is left is King's red gem.{nl}The secret device in Warehouse No. 1 has King's red gem.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003278	Be safe. {nl}This place is swarming with those demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003279	I feel guilty not doing anything while you are doing all the hard work.{nl}I mean, I feel useless because of all those demon barriers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003280	Now, we are one step closer. {nl}3 more King's gems to go.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003281	Now, let's disable the demon barrier in the storage.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003282	I would have to pay a part of my soul as a price but... {nl}I had one piece just now so, I can endure.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003283	Please, destroy the monsters on your way to the demon barrier. {nl}All our struggles would be in vain if we get captured by the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003284	Get to the barrier and use Teal Magic Stone to call me and I will disable the demon barrier.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003285	Failing my duty is the only thing I truly fear.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003286	We have disable two barriers now.{nl}I bet the demons have noticed something by now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003287	We need to interrogate the demons.{nl}It is quite crucial to know how much they know.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003288	In the hanging room, there is a secret device that seems useful.{nl}There is a magic device that gives out hallucination. Disguise yourself as a monster and let's get the info from them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003289	The hallucination device in the hanging room uses spell or souls to create its shape.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003290	So that means to create a hallucination of a demon, {nl}You have to defeat a demon that you want to make a hallucination out of near the hallucination device.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003291	I think the reason why King Kadumel made such device, {nl}is to perhaps fool the enemies and escape himself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003292	However, I still do have some questions about how to use the device.{nl}I feel like I am missing something here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003293	Have you found out something?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003294	They don't suspect that the revelator is here. {nl}If anything, they think I am the intruder. Well, no one is stupid or brave enough to sneak in.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003295	But Grinender is here... now that is no good news.{nl}We ought to find Grinender's Seal that the demons are talking about.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003296	It seems that that is what can disable the magic circle created by Grinender.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003297	While you get Grinender's Seal, I will be planning on how to hit Grinender where it hurts.{nl}There must be something.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003298	Some planning is needed for secret devices in the solitary confinement section.{nl}If I am remembering correctly, there were things like teleport scrolls or a magic device...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003299	Did you get Grinender's Seal?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003300	Good. I also had figured out a plan to get back at those demons.{nl}If it works, we might just easily get through the solitary confinement section.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003301	Here's the plan, get the teleport scroll and get straight to theLong Sentence Prison Cells.{nl}And activate the defense device and exterminate them all.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003302	The demons in the mid hallway would not know what hit them.{nl}And we walk away like cool guys do. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003303	The first thing we should do is to get ahold of that scroll.{nl}The teleport magic scroll is inside the secret device located in the prisoner waiting room.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003304	You and I make a great team.{nl}You need a password to open the secret device.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003305	I believe it was a name of a goddess. {nl}Gabija, Ausrine, Vakarine, Zemyna, Vaivora, Jurate... And you know a lot more, right?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003306	Vaivora, Vakarine, Ausrine, Gabija, Jurate, Zemyna... {nl}It might be enough.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003307	Now that we got the Teleport Magic Scroll and jump ahead to the Long Sentence Prison Cell.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003308	I will hold one of Teleport Magic Scrolls, just in case.{nl}The other one you should use it to get to the Long Sentence Prison Cells.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003309	When you get to the Long Sentence Prison Cells, turn on the defense device right away.{nl}The instruction is on the manual.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003310	I cannot go because of that Grinender. Once it falls, I will join you as soon as possible.{nl}Godspeed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003311	The defense device in the long sentence prison cells is intricate with some powerful magic.{nl}I had some explaining to do to the wardens the first time I activate the machine and caused a havoc.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003312	I came here as fast as I could after seeing you defeating Grinender.{nl}It was no easy task, I imagine but well done.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003313	With Grinender no more, the remnants don't stand a chance.{nl}Let's wipe them off so that they won't hinder our quest to find the King's gem.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003314	Don't let your guard down though. {nl}The demons can charge in at any time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003315	I hope Nebulas also would go down this easily.{nl}But I do have a bad feeling about this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003316	I hope this is just a feeling. Nothing more than that...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003317	Remarkable.{nl}Id I had your strength and skills, I would not have taken such a drastic choice..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003318	There is no point crying over spilt milk... {nl}The present is all that matters, right?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003319	Now let's disable the demon barrier in a genpop regular prison cell.{nl}King's green gem is inside the the secret device inside regular cells.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003320	Find it that and disable the demon barrier in the Reintegration Workshop.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003321	There are six crystals surrounding the secret device.{nl}Breathe spell into them and the device will unlock itself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003322	However, the crystals lose their potency after a while.{nl}So, please be haste.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003323	King Kadumel was never known to show any special talents in using magic. {nl}Probably, he had his mages activate such devices.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003324	The demons surely are showing suspicious signs.{nl}I don't have a good feeling about that...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003325	Darn, a dead end.{nl}They must have noticed us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003326	But then again, it is pretty hard to miss the work of art we've left in the solitary confinement area.{nl}Looking at how things are at the moment, we should obtain a different soul piece.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003327	I cannot move further due to demon magic. You are on your own for now.{nl}But fortunately, I can tell you the way to get to the other side.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003328	A cell in Individual Workshop has teleportation magic. {nl}It is something made by King Kadumel as a contingency plan.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003329	The magic is activated upon uttering a special sentence.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003330	I only remember one pass-sentence... {nl}So, you would have to find the cell with the right code.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003331	The magic sentence is
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003332	It's not that surprising that it is King Kadumel made the phrase.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003333	Get to the other side and find Soul Stone of Restrainment from the monsters.{nl}Find the Spirit Stones and free my other spirit.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003334	When you say the correct phrase in the right cell, you will be able to get to the other side.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003335	You have saved me.{nl}Are you perhaps the Revelator?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003336	Just as I have expected.{nl}It is indeed marvelous to see that my other spirits have not failed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003337	You have come this far, so perhaps, it is quite safe to assume that you are in fact seeking King's gems. Am I correct in assuming so?{nl}If my memory serves me rightfully, there are two King's gems and one of them is hidden inside the storage. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003338	Alas, the other one has fallen into the hands of Nebulas..{nl}No all is lost, let us take comfort in that and find the yellow one first in the workshop. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003339	King's yellow gem is stored in the secret device located in Supply Room.{nl}There four fragments each with unique types such as Fire, Ice, Electricity and Poison needed to open the secret device.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003340	It originally belonged to me but, I am terribly ashamed to say this, got taken away by the monsters.{nl}It should be around here. We must retrieve it from the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003341	Curse me for a novie..{nl}I should not have never let Nebulas lay his hand on King's blue gem...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003342	All the pieces have been brought together. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003343	Blimey, there is a slight problem.{nl}The pieces have been contaminated by the evil energy from the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003344	We ought to purify them.{nl}Providentially, there is a way to perform such task.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003345	The top of the Supply Room, the part where lights are in, there will be Light Crystal.{nl}Shien the pieces with its light. That would purify them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003346	Doing it once or twice will not be sufficient.{nl}You must keep on shining the light at the m until all the evil energy is casted out.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003347	After the purification process is complete, head down to Supply Room.{nl}Open the secret device there and obtain the yellow gem.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003348	Place the pieces into the spots around the secret device to open it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003349	I am still under Dominance Magic and hinders my movement..{nl}As soon as such limitation is removed, I will quickly join you in Supply Room.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003350	I do not profess to know how Light Crystal is formed.{nl}One could only conjecture that it is a result of collected good aspects of souls fell in this prison...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003351	You've acquired the yellow gem? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003352	What good news.{nl}I am now able to move again.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003353	There is a secret devicein the Punishment Room.{nl}It can be activated by a very strong magic attack.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003354	Once it is activated, we can jolly well blast through the demons and their putrid magic that are standing in our way..{nl}All good things are not that easy to earn as we know by now. I do not have the necessary memory in regards to how to operate it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003355	My word, you have the manual! {nl}Goddesses be praised! It makes the entire thing much easier.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003356	Activating the secret device in the Punishment Room will surely deal an overwhelming blow to the demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003357	This strike would definitely leave a mark on their side.{nl}And the magic blocking the way is now go as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003358	Righty-O!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003359	There might be some monsters left in Segregated Ward.{nl}The radius of the blast was not that wide.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003360	We are in this to disalbe demon barriers... {nl}So, eliminating the remaining monsters is in the job description.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003361	I will reuniting with my other spirit.{nl}I will join you right away.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003362	If I recollect all my separated spirits, I might be able to find a way to..{nl}Defeat Nebulas once and for all.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003363	I can sense something strange.{nl}It is not a pleasant one, I can surely tell you that.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003364	So bizarre... There is a very powerful energy from that direction.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003365	I believe it is from Nebulas...{nl}Even so, it is far too strong.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003366	This is wrong. Nebulas power should not be that high...{nl}We must find out what happened.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003367	There is an observational detector nearby.{nl}But... when the demons invaded, the monsters broke it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003368	If we could retrieve some parts, we might be able to figure something out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003369	The detector is located up on the next floor.{nl}The nearby monsters might have the parts.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003370	What on earth has happened to Nebulas?{nl}He was a strong demon to begin with but this is ludicrous.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003371	Wait, the demon barrier is that strong? {nl}Inconceivable...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003372	The power emitting from that one is stronger than all the previous four barriers put together.{nl}Perhaps, this is doing of a demon higher than Nebulas...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003373	Before we disable the barrier, we have no chance against Nebulas.{nl}Now the Dominance Magic will not hold.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003374	Desperate times call for desperate measures.{nl}I will enhance the Dominance Magic until it's strong enough to disable that barrier.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003375	It means, I would have to pay my whole soul for it.{nl}For a Stronger Dominance Magic the price paid gets increased aswell.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003376	It must be done...{nl}If not, Nebulas can never be defeated.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003377	After all, this was caused by my own failure to protect the revelation.{nl}It is my responsibility.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003378	The cessation of my existence is a small price to pay for delivering the revelation to you, the revelator.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003379	Defeating Nebulas and getting the revelation...{nl}Saving the world is the task, only you could do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003380	Leave the demon barrier up to me.{nl}All you need to focus on is defeating Nebulas and obtaining the revelation.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003381	There is no time to lose. Don't waste your precious seconds worrying about me.{nl}We are racing against the clock.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003382	Use the secret device near the incinerator to enhance the Dominance Magic.{nl}But it requires Energy Crystals first.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003383	Find Energy Crystals placed on the floor above the Incinerator.{nl}Once enough crystals have been collected, you can activate the secret device.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003384	We must hurry before Nebulas finds us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003385	I cannot even fathom what functions were intended for the secret device near the incinerator.{nl}I have never heard that King Kadumel was so knowledgeable in magic.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003386	What good could come out of enhancing such minute spell?{nl}I am not complaining, it did give us the ample opportunity to combat Nebulas thanks to that secret device.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003387	The secret device is operating perfectly.{nl}I will be here enhancing the Dominance Magic.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003388	As for you, activate all the secret devices in the Interrogation Room.{nl}That would buy us some time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003389	I have faith in you.{nl}You would not have much difficulty.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003390	Either activating secret devices to attack demons... {nl}Or destroy demon devices or magic circles. Do whatever you seem fit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003391	By the way,{nl}I'd appreciate it if you could deal with some of the monsters on the way so they won't be able to get here.{nl}Give me the signal with the Teal Magic Stone as soon as you get to the Barrier.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003392	It better not be too late.{nl}I really don't wanna fail twice.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003406	Ugh... The poison is spreading too much...{nl}Who're you? Are you with Sarma?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003407	Is it...? That means Gatre was right.{nl}Sarma released the poison on us and left.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003408	The poison is still spreading... I don't know if we can take it much longer.{nl}We would need the Barha antidote to neutralize it all... please help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003409	To make the antidote we need ingredients.{nl}Get me some Barha Herbs first.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003410	Thank you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003411	Gatre did say Sarma looked suspicious...{nl}But who knew this would happen...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003412	You got the Barha herbs.{nl}Looks like we'll be okay with you around.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003413	We also need some Griba juice to make the antidote.{nl}You can get it from Red Big Gribas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003414	There's plenty of Big Red Gribas around here, shouldn't be hard to find some.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003415	The Griba juice is the last ingredient we need for the antidote.{nl}We can use the reagent maker to finish the antidote after that, so hurry up.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003416	Sorry to ask this, especially since you're so helpful, but please hurry.{nl}I'm starting to lose my senses...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003417	Oh.{nl}You got the Griba juice too.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003418	We should be able to make the antidote in the reagent maker now.{nl}You need to follow the recipe very carefully.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003419	You'll see two reagent makers next to the alchemy table.{nl}Process the herbs on the left-side reagent maker, the one with smoke coming out of it, and the Griba juice on the right.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003420	Once you have the ingredients processed, put them in the antidote flask on the alchemy table.{nl}And please hurry... I'm losing my sight now...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003421	The poison is still spreading...{nl}I'm counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003422	Oh... Thank you.{nl}I'm still a little sore, but the effects of the poison are gone.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003423	Sarma came running and laughing like a crazy person when he released the poison on the researchers.{nl}We couldn't escape and ended up like this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003424	Sarma made that poison by accident after failing time after time...{nl}This could have been his plan, for all we know.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003425	What worries me is that he was headed to where the villagers are.{nl}They all helped in Sarma's research and now they could be in danger. Take the antidote, just in case.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003426	I'm glad to be alive, but my body still isn't moving right.{nl}If Gatre sent you, you're the only one I can trust.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003427	Researcher Veed
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003428	Ugh, who are you?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003429	I hope they're all safe...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003430	Is Gatre...?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003431	Sarma would have wiped us all if it weren't for Gatre.{nl}Of course, we owe you a lot as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003432	Sarma went south, but he must have sprayed the overgrowth solution all around and now the path is blocked by vines.{nl}We can't get past.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003433	We can make a neutralizer to reduce these vines, though.{nl}I would do it myself, but it seems my body has its own will at this moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003434	If you go to our research room, there's a paper there with the recipes for the neutralizer and other solutions.{nl}Just find that piece of paper.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003435	Once you find the paper, just follow the instructions to make the neutralizer.{nl}The ingredients will also be written on that paper.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003436	Oh, I still can believe Sarma betrayed us, I'm furious right now.{nl}I would so show him if my body wasn't still in this state.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003437	You managed to make the neutralizer, it seems.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003438	You can just spray the neutralizer all over the giant vines.{nl} But there's something I want you to do on the way.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003439	The antidote you have with you is not enough to cure Sarma's poison.{nl}The paper at the research room also has a recipe for an antidote enhancer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003440	But Sarma didn't tell us which ingredients he used to make it.{nl}You'll have to look for Sarma's research documents to find out.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003441	Talk to Sireah after you find the materials for the enhancer.{nl}She's the one in charge of making the solutions, she'll know what to do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003442	Let's just hope Sarma didn't get to her too.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003443	Sarma... And here I thought he was helping us the whole time...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003444	Researcher Sireah
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003445	W-who are you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003446	Veed told you to come see me?{nl}I came here to avoid getting contaminated with Sarma's poison.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003447	Veed wants me to enhance the antidote?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003448	{nl}Okay.{nl}Give me the antidote and the ingredients.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003449	Done.{nl}This antidote should be enough to counteract Sarma's poison.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003450	Will you clear out the poison from the area that got contaminated?{nl}It's too dangerous right now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003451	You can use the enhanced antidote to detoxify the area.{nl}Hurry, before the poison spreads any further.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003452	Is the area clean now?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003453	I'm glad to hear it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003454	Sarma contaminated the area so we couldn't go after him, then he went north.{nl}He used all of the poison and blocked the way behind him.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003455	But I think you can get through it with this antidote.{nl}Be careful, though, you never know what he might do next.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003456	I still don't understand what it is that Sarma wants...{nl}Why did he made a fool of all of us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003457	All I know is that he's dangerous now.{nl}Please, you have to stop Sarma.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003458	I just hope all the others are safe...{nl}I'm so worried.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003459	You're back.{nl}What happened to Sarma?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003460	Wow... At least he got what he deserved.{nl}It was the goddesses who punished him, I'm telling you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003461	Who knows, maybe it was the goddesses who brought you to us too.{nl}Thank you so much for saving us and the villagers.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003462	If it weren't for you, we...{nl}I don't even want to think about it...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003463	Oh! By the way, Gatre was looking for you just now.{nl}They were worried when they heard you were going after Sarma. Go and see them if you can.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003464	My goodness...{nl}Are you alright?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003465	Aidas and Veed told me what happened on the way here.{nl}I'm so sorry I got you caught up in a dangerous situation like that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003466	But I want to say thank you.{nl}If it weren't for you, we would never be able to save everyone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003467	Now we know not to trust people like Sarma and we're going to take care of the village ourselves.{nl}We'll be careful not to let something like this happen again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003468	Something's happened after Sarma spread the poison around here.{nl}The monsters have changed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003469	They're going around spraying the poison everywhere.{nl}At this rate, it won't be long before the villagers are affected.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003470	We need to stop these monsters before it's too late.{nl}You seem capable enough, won't you help us out?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003471	I knew we could count on you.{nl}You should be able to tell which monsters were affected by the poison, they have a green glow to them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003472	Sarma really worked some havoc here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003473	The research Sarma was doing was too dangerous, we can't just leave it be.{nl}I think it would be best to get rid of the equipment.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003474	Sarma had a main research room where he made the poison.{nl}We'll take care of the other research rooms, meanwhile you can go and destroy the equipment in the main room.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003475	Sarma had a main research room where he made the poison.{nl}We'll take care of the other research rooms, meanwhile you can go and destroy the equipment in the main room.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003476	Good.{nl}Everything Sarma was working on must be destroyed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003477	The research equipment is spread out here and there so it won't be easy getting rid of it all.{nl}And we need to have some antidote saved.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003478	That should do it.{nl}We'll take care of the rest ourselves.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003479	What could possibly have led Sarma to do this...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003480	I can't move my body...{nl}The poison is spreading.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003481	Because of Sarma everything has turned into chaos.{nl}I can't believe this...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003482	We can make it work if we join efforts with the villagers.{nl}We sure learned a lot from this whole ordeal.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003483	I'm still sore but I feel fine.{nl}I'm just glad nothing worse happened to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003484	What do we do now?{nl}We really need to think about it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003485	Thanks to you we managed to avoid the worst.{nl}It's up to us now to solve the rest.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003487	I thought I'd be able to fight anything to make my father better...{nl}But now that I'm face-to-face with the monsters, I can't help but be scared.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003488	That elder's prescription is our only hope.{nl}We need those Tini horns to work...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003489	Would... you perhaps be able to help me?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003490	I came all the way here to get Tini horns.{nl}My father is ill and the shiny Tini horns are supposed to make him better.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003491	I didn't realise how frightening it was being here... I don't think I can do it on my own.{nl}Would you be so kind to help my father?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003492	Apparently their horns only shine after being pulled out.{nl}Curious, isn't it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003493	Thank you so much.{nl}I will never forget this favor.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003499	I think I can make it to Maven Abbey with some medicinal herbs.{nl}They're called Taumas herbs... they look a little different from the grass around it. Please bring me some.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003500	The Taumas herbs release a scent when you pick them.{nl}This scent can attract monsters, so please be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003501	Thank you.{nl}Are you also going to Maven Abbey?{nl}May the goddesses hear your prayers then.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003502	I've walked this path so many times, but this time has been by far the roughest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003503	I hope my buddies at the monastery are okay.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003504	You there.{nl}Can I talk to you for a second?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003505	You don't seem like a common fellow...{nl}Will you help an old man in trouble?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003506	I'm also on my way to Maven Abbey like the other pilgrims.{nl}But something's different about this path. Because of Medzio Diena, I s'pose...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003507	I hurt my leg earlier when some monsters attacked me, I even lost my bags.{nl}I had some important things I want to give to my buddies in there...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003508	So I'm asking you.{nl}If the Tinis don't scare you, please bring me back my bags.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003509	No idea why the Tinis were so interested in my things.{nl}Don't know which one took them either... Some luck, huh.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003510	My bags, you found them!{nl}I can go on with my journey now. Not sure if I can keep walking but...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003511	If you don't mind, I have one more favor to ask.{nl}Can you get me a stick that I can use as a cane?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003512	I'm very sorry, child.{nl}May the grace of the goddesses be with you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003513	I just need something sturdy enough to take all the way to the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003514	Now that's sturdy!{nl}Should have no problems getting to the monastery now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003515	Ah, but what to do about these monsters...{nl}They're a pain in the neck, I'm telling you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003516	Are you going to Maven Abbey too?{nl}If you don't mind, would you come with me just half the way?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003517	{nl}No need to go to far, just until the road to Salvia Forest up there.{nl}You know the old building there? That's where I want you to take me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003518	Do you know this monk?{nl}If something went wrong, they could have escaped. The goddesses' grace must have been with them.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003520	At last we found someone!{nl}Please, we're trying to help this monk.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003521	What's this?{nl}Why are they lying here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003522	What could've happened at the monastery?{nl}Fortunately they're still breathing...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003523	The goddesses are truly looking over us{nl}Certainly finding this monk here was not a coincidence.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003524	We must never lose hope.{nl}And we must never forsake our prayers to the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003525	Oh no...{nl}That monk... They look like they've starved for days.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003526	I will cook them a stew.{nl}Traveler, would you bring me some meat?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003527	The only meat worth eating in this area should be Tini meat.{nl}Please go and gather some.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003528	We should hurry.{nl}They look extremely weak already.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003529	Come back after you've helped my husband.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003530	Thank you.{nl}I will cook this for the monk.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003531	I hope the monk can get their senses back soon, they need to recover.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003532	This is the first time my husband and I do a pilgrimage to Maven Abbey.{nl}If the rumors are true, praying to the goddesses there will make everything better.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003533	Oh my, what was I thinking?{nl}We don't have enough water.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003534	I saw an old well up north on our way here.{nl}Would you go there with my husband and bring me some water?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003535	My husband will draw the water.{nl}Please look after him and don't let the monsters go near.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003536	Are you ready?{nl}Let's go, then.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003537	The well is up there.{nl}We should hurry.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003538	Thank you.{nl}This will help my wife look after the monk.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003539	Thank you.{nl}Finding you was truly a fortunate thing to happen to this poor monk.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003540	Could this be anything but the will of the goddess?{nl}We'll have them drink some water first, then the stew.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003541	If this poor fellow if lying here...{nl}Something isn't right at the monastery, don't you think?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003542	Imagine the things they must have gone through, a healthy person like that in this state...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003543	What could've made them be outside of the monastery like this...{nl}In any case, we should take care of them first.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003544	{nl}First things first, fire.{nl}We'll need some if we're going to make some stew or keep warm.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003545	Traveller. I'm so sorry but...{nl}Can I ask you for some wood for the fire?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003546	Go to the Vabalas Vacant Lot.{nl}You should find some firewood we can use there.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003547	Really wonder what happened to my buddy here...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003548	This should do it.{nl}Let's get started with the fire then. Thanks.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003550	Thank you for saving my life.{nl}I'm worried for the monastery, however. I wonder if my brothers are safe...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003551	I was fortunate to find my friend here.{nl}I can't imagine what would have happened should he have gone to the monastery.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003553	Thank you...{nl}You're the kind people who saved me, is that right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003554	I'm Monk Ethan, from Maven Abbey.{nl}Please... You mustn't go to the monastery!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003555	The abbey was taken by an organization called the Tree of Truth.{nl}They accused me of conspiring with the demons and expelled me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003556	As if that weren't enough, they sent one of them to chase after me.{nl}It was a miracle of the goddesses having made it this far...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003557	Trust my words. You must not go to the monastery.{nl}The Tree of Truth do not worship the goddesses as we do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003558	My goodness... Do you mean the monastery was forcefully taken?{nl}The historic Maven Abbey?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003559	{nl}And by that unlawful order calling themselves the Tree of Truth...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003560	You should speak with my friend now.{nl}Let's see what he has to say.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003561	It's a shame they chose not to listen to my words.{nl}The very same people who saved my life...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003562	Hm... I hope those pilgrims stay safe.{nl}I'm going to stay here with my friend.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003563	Ethan says they're recruiting people to fight the Order.{nl}I'm heading to Klaipeda as soon as I get better.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003564	The problem is all these monsters blocking the way.{nl}As a last favor, would you clear out some monsters around here?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003565	I'm really sorry for making you work so much.{nl}Just do this one last thing for me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003566	No, no. It's still too dangerous.{nl}Get some more of those monsters if you can.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003567	There's too many monsters on the way to Klaipeda, you see.{nl}I'm asking you. I've no one else I can trust.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003568	You're too kind, I can't thank you enough.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003569	Not many good people like you left these days.{nl}May the grace of the goddesses be with you always.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003570	Things seemed normal all the way to Taumas Forest, but here it's extremely cold.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003571	I can't see my own breath, but I'm freezing.{nl}This doesn't make any sense. Brrrr...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003572	I was still cold even with all the leather...{nl}But I feel more relaxed now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003573	Traveller... please help me.{nl}I was on a pilgrimage to Maven Abbey but I can't walk anymore...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003574	I must be sick... I can't stand the cold...{nl}Would bring me some leather, something to cover myself with...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003575	You should be able to gather some leather from the Red Spions around here...{nl}Please, you need to help me...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003576	I can't stop shivering ever since I arrived in Salvia Forest...{nl}I'm starting to think I might really die here...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003577	Thank you, really.{nl}This leather should keep me from freezing to death...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003578	I'm so cold and hungry...{nl}Not even Medzio Diena was this brutal.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003579	Would you perhaps have something to eat? I'm starving.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003580	I feel full even though I didn't eat.{nl}I only have Clark to thank.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003581	It's funny... I feel so hungry ever since I got here...{nl}I already ate everything I had...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003582	I'll take anything.{nl}Don't you have anything I could eat?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003583	Can you pick me some berries from Salvia Brambles?{nl}I would be very thankful...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003584	How long is it going to take?{nl}I feel like going to the goddess if I stay like this any longer...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003585	Thank you.{nl}I never felt as cold or hungry as I do now...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003586	I barely made it out of Taumas, but no luck. This place is just as full of monsters{nl}Now I'm not only cold and hungry, I'm too scared too even move.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003587	Killing them is no use, there's always more and more.{nl}Just where are these monsters coming from?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003588	I think I can take on the monsters now that I'm no longer cold or hungry.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003589	I'm so cold and so hungry...{nl}But most of all I'm scared of all the monsters...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003590	Please.{nl}Could you take care of any monsters around here?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003591	No, there's still too many.{nl}Please, just a little more.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003592	Thank you.{nl}I need to find a way to deal with the hunger and the cold now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003593	Do not waver before false beliefs.{nl}In this confounding world of ours, we must follow the will of the Divine Tree.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003594	The world knows not how to worship the divine goddesses.{nl}The Tree of Truth can show you the way.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003595	Greetings.{nl}We are the Order of the Tree of Truth.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003596	We are expelling the false believers...{nl}... and propagating true faith in this monastery.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003597	We came to protect incoming pilgrims from the monsters.{nl}But it seems a contagious disease has affected the surrounding areas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003598	Should you too be interested in true faith...{nl}Won't you help us care for the pilgrims suffering from this disease?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003599	Oh, is that so?{nl}I'll prepare some medicine in that case. You may go with Follower Clark and help the pilgrims in need.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003600	I'll ask you to watch over Follower Clark while he tends to the pilgrims.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003601	Many pilgrims are still suffering from this terrible disease.{nl}We ought to hurry and help them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003602	Please help Follower Clark heal the ailing pilgrims.{nl}Time is running short.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003603	Pilgrim in Treatment
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003604	I would be in deep water if it weren't for the followers of the Tree of Truth.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003605	I only need to rest a little longer before I finally head to the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003606	I don't see Follower Brutus.{nl}He said he would go prepare the medicine, but where is he?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003607	The Order of the Tree of Truth exists to serve humanity by the will of the Divine Tree.{nl}Help those in need and be blessed by the Divine Tree.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003608	Those of us already under the grace of the Tree are safe, but I worry for the pilgrims that have yet to convert.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003609	You might have heard the negative rumors about our Order.{nl}Pure fabrications with no ground on truth. We are merely offering help to those who need it the most.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003610	I can't tell what Follower Brutus is thinking.{nl}I think it would be best to follow him/
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003611	But traveler.{nl}Do you not see what's strange?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003612	The ailing pilgrims look very similar to the monsters that inhabit these lands.{nl}I'm talking about... the black energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003613	There's something... strange about it.{nl}There is something I would like to test; would you help me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003614	Thank you.{nl}This medicine is the same one I gave to the pilgrims...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003615	Several Red Spions around the area are cursed, surrounded by black energy.{nl}I would like you to apply the medicine on them and see how they react.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003616	It's very strange.{nl}Please, give the medicine to the Red Spions surrounded by dark energy.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003617	The black energy disappears?{nl}Could this mean the medicine is not curing a disease but a curse?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003618	That's... very strange indeed.{nl}It seems Follower Brutus has returned; do speak to him about the reaction of the monsters to the medicine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003619	A curse, you say?{nl}That's utter nonsense! The condition we're curing is indubitably a disease!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003620	Furthermore. The medicine we use is made from very precious ingredients.{nl}One does not use such a medicine on monsters like you did!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003621	Both you and Follower Clark ought to be ashamed!{nl}Thanks to you large amounts of the medicine were wasted.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003622	Now, I need to make more medicine.{nl}I appreciate your help, but if you have no other business to attend to here, I suggest you leave.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003623	What happened with Follower Brutus?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003624	He sounds furious...{nl}But it's strange. Disease or curse, isn't it worth curing either way?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003625	This is all very suspicious.{nl}He's never told us what is in the medicine or how it is made, either.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003626	I ought to find out more about this...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003627	This altar is filled with what are clearly evil demon objects.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003628	Who could have guessed Brutus was a demon...?{nl}We must tell Deymantas about this.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003629	Follower Brutus always makes his medicine alone.{nl}We should follow him.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003630	Will you come with me?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003631	I can't believe Brutus was a real demon!{nl}You don't seem like the common folk either, from the way you defeated him.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003632	This is grave, we have demons hiding among our Order.{nl}You don't suppose our chiefs will know about this...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003633	I would like to inspect the altar where he performed his ceremonies.{nl}But as you can see, this place is rather dark. I can't see very well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003634	I would like to ask.{nl}Would you gather some tree leaves we can use to make a fire?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003635	I'm in shock... wait, I need to think.{nl}I can't believe it... a demon...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003636	You brought the leaves. Thank you.{nl}Light them up so we can see better.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003637	I should be able to have a look now.{nl}Let's see...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003638	I remember seeing these patterns before.{nl}I believe they were used for placing curses...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003639	Does this mean the disease was really a curse placed by Brutus?{nl}It would make sense.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003640	There's no doubt the demons are attempting to slander the order.{nl}They must be the reason behind the rumors.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003641	This is urgent, I need to return to the monastery immediately and alert the High Officers.{nl}Please tend to the other pilgrims meanwhile.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003642	Traveller. Did Follower Clark really leave?{nl}Myself and the other pilgrims haven't recovered, I don't think we can continue our journey just yet.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003643	{nl}We're worried about the monsters in this area.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003644	There's too monsters around for us to be safe.{nl}Did Follower Clark return yet?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003645	Follower Clark is late. What could have happened to him?{nl}Traveller. I'll ask you for one more favor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003646	Thank you.{nl}I'll do my best to recover.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003647	Thank you.{nl}There still seems to be quite a lot of them around... but it's a little better than before.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003648	It feels a lot safer than before.{nl}We'll try to recover now, so we can carry on with our pilgrimage. Thank you.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003650	We too are servants of the goddesses.{nl}We cannot ignore the murder of our clerics.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003651	Surely wise monks of Maven Abbey will give this soul a rightful judgment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003652	I have no reasons to doubt the monk.{nl}It's the demons who ought to be punished.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003653	The Tree of Truth you describe sounds very different from what I heard.{nl}They could very well be conspiring with the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003654	You ask why this monk is tied?{nl}We don't know if this person really is a monk, but in any case that does not concern you, does it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003655	Are you really that curious?{nl}Alright... Since you aksed, then.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003656	We're pilgrims coming from Grynas Trails.{nl}We arrived here and, what do you know, we start to hear someone screaming!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003657	This is who we found when we followed the sound.{nl}The one dressed in monk garments was passed out on the ground.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003658	Isn't it obvious? This person murdered a monk.{nl}Would you not tie up a person suspected of murdering a cleric?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003659	We want to bring this person to the monastery and let them be judged there.{nl}The folk at the abbey will know what to do.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003660	These people are misunderstanding me.{nl}I have no reasons to hurt one of the brothers.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003661	I was the one who screamed!{nl}I'm a monk at Maven Abbey...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003662	The monastery is in chaos because of the Tree of Truth.{nl}So I escaped with my brother and we ended up in this area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003663	And yet... My mistake was leaving my tired brother behind for a moment...{nl}I screamed when I returned to find them dead already...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003664	That's when these people arrived and took me for the criminal.{nl}Please, help me. I'm innocent, I swear!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003665	Well, you can listen to what this shameless criminal has to say if you want.{nl}But it will all be lies.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003666	Please believe me!{nl}I did not hurt one of my brothers!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003667	These people are seriously misunderstanding the situation.{nl}Please help me clear things out.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003668	I'm glad we clarified the situation.{nl}But the fact remains that something horrible happened.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003669	I'm worried for the safety of the other monks.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003670	We have reasons to believe this person is the culprit.{nl}Try and convince the other pilgrims if you believe otherwise.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003671	If you can't prove that this person is innocent...{nl}We have no choice but to leave their faith up to the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003672	Do as you wish.{nl}The pilgrims over there know what they saw.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003673	I and the others all believe that person is a criminal.{nl}They claim to be innocent... but what would you expect a criminal to say?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003674	Revelator, please.{nl}Help me prove my innocence.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003675	W-what? Now that's...{nl}Hm, I stil don't think...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003676	Alright, alright. I guess I was wrong.{nl}I apologize for being suspicious...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003677	I'm really sorry.{nl}It's the demons and the Tree of Truth who are wrong. We almost punished the wrong person.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003678	Pilgrim David
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003679	We had no choice but to assume he was the culprit.{nl}I believe Vados made the right decision.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003680	All circumstances point to him being the criminal, it's all very clear.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003681	I feel extremely sorry for the monk.{nl}If only we had believe them this whole ordeal would never have been.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003682	It isn't right to suspect people at will, I understand that now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003683	I don't think that person is a real monk.{nl}He could just be pretending, couldn't he?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003684	{nl}If he was really a monk, would he have a way to prove it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003685	Then show us proof that this person is really a monk.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003686	They want proof... I suppose reciting the scriptures won't be enough.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003687	{nl}I do have a rosary made at our monastery, however.{nl}It has my name engraved on it too.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003688	{nl}I dropped the rosary when I was caught by the pilgrims.{nl}It should be near my luggage, at the Deveera Forest Road. Please find it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003689	{nl}If I show them the rosary, it will prove to them that I am a monk.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003690	As expected, no proof that this person is a monk so far.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003691	You say this is his rosary?{nl}It's true, it has the name Dorma engraved in it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003692	{nl}It really looks like he's a monk.{nl}But why would he harm another monk?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003693	Pilgrim Eli
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003694	Dares to impersonate a monk on top of that harming a monk? {nl}There is no need to go to the abbey. Let's go get him straight to Klaipeda.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003695	All circumstances point to being guilty but still maintaining innocence.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003696	A man can err. {nl}I am just glad all misunderstanding have been solved.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003697	I have been told that the Order of the Tree of Truth was a trusty organization showing the people a new way. {nl}But they were working with the demons all along. That is why you cannot trust heresays.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003698	I was the first founder of that person and the body together.{nl}I still believe that person is the perpetrator.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003699	I even saw a bloody knife on his hand.{nl}A body and a man with a knife, what more solid evidence could you possibly want?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003700	Let's what kind ingenious excuses he is going to spout.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003701	I am innocent!{nl}I was merely examining the knife stuck inside my colleague.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003702	{nl}The demons that were following had a similar weapon...{nl}My colleague was struck by demons!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003703	There is one way to prove my innocence.{nl}Proving that the knife is indeed from demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003704	Please, find my luggage at Deveera Forest Road. In it, you will get Holy Water.{nl}Get that Holy Water to Vados and ask him to pour it on the knife.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003705	My luggage is located at the upper side of Deveera Forest Road. Please, find the Holy Water inside my luggage
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003706	This is the Holy Water that was in his luggage? {nl}Then, can we test if this is indeed a genuine article.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003707	Yes, that is a real one.{nl}Please, hand it to him.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003708	Let us test the authenticity of the Holy Water.{nl}Please, sprinkle it on nearby Yellow Dumaros and observe their reactions.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003709	Sprinkle the Holy Water on Yellow Dumaros and see the results.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003710	As you wish, Vados.{nl}Those demons will surely show the effect.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003711	I am yet to be convinced whether this is real Holy Water or not.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003712	Hmm... the demons did react in an expected manner, right?{nl}Then now let us test his claim.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003713	Now, we will pour Holy Water unto the weapon this man was holding to see if this is a demonic weapon or not.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003714	{nl}But be warned, even if the weapon reacts, that would not be the end of it.{nl}He might be a demon himself and his current appearance might be just a disguise.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003715	{nl}We would have to make him drink it as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003716	Uh, at least you are a monk.{nl}Please, pardon my previous insolence. That means this is a demon's doing after all?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003717	Now, all the suspicions Eli had have been resolved.{nl}But not all suspicions on him have been resolved yet.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003718	Pilgrim George
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003719	Monks usually do not venture outside the abbey.{nl}My suspicion is that why would you come to this place that is far away from the abbey.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003720	Mere coincidences are not enough to explain the circumstances. Especially when the suspicion fits the circumstance so perfectly. {nl}I am still yet to be convinced of his innocence.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003721	I was terribly mistaken.{nl}I should properly apologize to the monk.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003722	The circumstances be. It is for the best to figure out a way to get safely back with the monk.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003723	If I may speak of my suspicion.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003724	{nl}Why would two monks travel to such a remote place.{nl}And at the time of the actual murder, why was he absent?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003725	{nl}I cannot help but to doubt his innocence.{nl}Why were they here and where was he at the time of the murder.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003726	Our abbey is in great peril.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003727	{nl}The Order of the Tree of Truth has came and is currently occupying the abbey.{nl}Furthermore, they forced us to be converted.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003728	{nl}Of course, we escaped to get help from outside.{nl}But then, the demons started to chase after us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003729	{nl}We barely escaped to this Sekta Forest. The escape was so sudden and harsh one and it took its toll on my brethren. He collapsed from hunger and thirst.{nl}That is why I was away; looking for something to eat and drink.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003730	{nl}I hope this sufficiently my story.{nl}Please, pass it on to him.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003731	To prove a monk's innocence, I request answers to my questions...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003732	I see. {nl}But words are not enough.{nl}I want to see something solid.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003733	That's all I can say.{nl}I am not sure whether he would believe it or not.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003734	Solid evidence? {nl}I don't know what to do.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003735	{nl}Well, I did gather some plant roots as something to eat. {nl}While gathering, I did throw out the bad ones...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003736	{nl}Would that be enough?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003737	I am grateful for doing this for me.{nl}The location where I threw them away was Gingkaras Reed Field. Please search them in that vicinity.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003738	On Gingkaras Reed Field, there would be plant roots that it seemed unfit to eat.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003739	Were there any evidences to prove his alibi?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003740	Quite partially rotten. Very unfit to eat, indeed. But they do seem freshly dugged out.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003741	{nl}I am convinced. I now believe what the monk had claimed.{nl}I should apologize to him properly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003742	Yes, those are the rotten plant roots that I threw out.{nl}Please, prove my innocence.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003743	We have been chased by the demons. {nl}But a strange thing was that they seemed to be intending to capture us rather than kill us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003744	They must have changed their attitude.{nl}Does this mean, they no longer see the need to convert us? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003745	I am only alive because I was away at the time. {nl}If I was with him, the same fate would have hit me as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003746	If what the monk has been telling is true. All the other monks are... {nl}We should eliminate the demons that are targeting the monks.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003747	I have already forgotten and forgiven what happened.{nl}Forgiveness is the main virtue of a clergyman, after all.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003748	Anwyay, Vados seems to have something to speak to you about.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003749	I have a cunning plan.{nl}If the demons are still looking for the Monk, we could trap them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003750	Please, take the monk to Mova Wilderness.{nl}The demons, unaware of your true feats, will decide to attack.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003751	Your power would be more than enough to teach them who is the boss. {nl}We are counting on you!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003752	Vados seems to be thinking about something.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003753	I knew you would help.{nl}As soon as you are ready, get going with the monk.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003754	I have heard from Vados about the plan.{nl}When you are ready, shall we?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003755	As soon as they show their ugly heads in Mova Wilderness, strike them down at once.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003756	Good work.{nl}We have been thinking. We will follow the monk's advice.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003757	The pilgrimage ends here and we will get back to Klaipeda.{nl}You should get to safety as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003758	Thanks to you, Revelator, all the troubles and toils I was in have been resolved.{nl}I cannot thank you enough for this. The goddess shall present you with the appropriate grace to you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003759	You've eliminated all the demons that were after the monk? Impressive to say the least.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003760	The name 'Revelator' is not in vain, I suppose.{nl}Getting rid of the demons assassins just like that.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003761	I have heard that you have defeated the demons that were after the monk.{nl}It must have been hard work.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003763	Well, our way back is filled with monsters now. {nl}Vados says we can avoid them but I am worried.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003764	Could you defeat nearby monsters?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003765	I cannot deny that it is quite disappointing. We have come this far. {nl}However, nothing is more valuable to life, right?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003766	Thank you so much.{nl}Goddess is looking after you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003767	That's not good.{nl}Looking at our stock, our food supply is sure to run out on the way back.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003768	I am so ashamed to ask you this but... there is no other way.{nl}Could you get us some Lepusbunny Meat to replenish our food supply?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003769	I really appreciate your help.{nl}We only planned and stocked for the trip to the abbey...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003770	Demon Meat is unsuitable for consumption.{nl}The only option is meat from nearby Lepusbunny.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003771	I think we have enough for all of us. {nl}My heart is filled with gratitude.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003772	The teachings of the goddesses is based on mercy. {nl}If there is an exception, that would apply to the demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003773	Not only took my brethren's life but tried to harm me as well.{nl}This wrath I feel... I think even the goddesses would forgive me on this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003774	I beseech you.{nl}Please, show those demons the retribution.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003775	Thank you. {nl}The nearby demons are Yellow Dumaros.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003776	They seem like mere beasts but they are demons after all. So, please be vigilant. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003777	Thank you. {nl}I am eternally in your debt.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003778	Thank you.{nl}I thought I was going to get captured.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003786	Well, I believe it was a week ago.{nl}The Order of the Tree of Truth started to gather in front the abbey.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003787	They claimed we have been working alongside the demons. Such false accusation! {nl}Of course, we denied such ridiculous claim but they didn't listen...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003788	A female believer from the Order claimed that she can prove our allegiance with the demons.{nl}From the looks of her, she must hold an important position in the Order.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003789	She casted an incantation...{nl}And one of our brethrens turned into a demons. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003790	That must have be a visual trickery. {nl}The brethren was born in the abbey and have been raised there his entire life.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003791	The reaction from the Order Believers when they saw it was explosive.{nl}Within just few minutes, they began to drive us out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003792	Many of my monk brothers and sisters have ran away or have been captured.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003793	Only a handful of brethrens including me managed to escape... {nl}I am deathly worried about all of them. I have no way knowing what happened to the others.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003794	I know it is a vain struggle but... {nl}I did attempt to rescue the captured brethrens.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003795	The gate of the Abbey was shut tight. There was no way in.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003796	All I have left to trust is you Revelator.{nl}Please, save our brethrens and... the abbey.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003797	By the looks of it, mosts ofthe Believers are being duped by the higher ups...{nl}I believe they are innocent.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003798	There are 3 high-ranked officers in that Order.{nl}If we can expose their true motives, the Believers will see the truth about us as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003799	I believe they are in the abbey...{nl}A man called Domantas lead the Believers to this place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003800	They seemed to be looking for a way to lure pilgrims to the abbey in...{nl}First, we capture Domantas and figure out our way in the Abbey.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003801	They accused us of being demons... {nl}But I sensed the demon in them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003802	There must be demons among them. {nl}The officers and executives, most likely.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003803	If we can expose the true identity of Domantas, people will listen.{nl}I have something to test out. Could you help me on that?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003804	A long time ago, there was a holy monk famous for defeating demons.{nl}He died a martyr fighting demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003805	We never recovered the body but we placed the keepsake and made a grave.{nl}Among them, there are two devices that can determine a demon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003806	One of them is an orb that only attacks demons...{nl}The other is a mirror that shows the true self.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003807	Having at least one of them can show their true faces.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003808	It is very blasphemous but... {nl}At this time, there is no other way.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003809	The monk's grave is one of the four grave in Ketra Cemetry.{nl}Please, retrieve the keepsake that I have told you about.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003812	Could you help me recharge the mirror?

QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003814	This is our only opportunity, please, fill it up with power.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003819	Leaving the holy object like that is wrong for the Order...{nl}The least we could do is to build a shrine and pray to it...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003820	Is there any meaning to Maven Abbey?{nl}This place is a true holy place for goddeses who visit us every night...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003821	High Officer Domantas or one of the subordinates must be a demon in disguise.{nl}The problem is they don't stay in one place for long..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003822	We need to lure Domantas in.{nl}Perhaps, the Pilgrim Camp down there...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003823	I have seen Domantas and the believers of the Order preaching to the pilgrims.{nl}Let's go to the camp and figure out the way to lure Domantas in.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003824	Thank you. {nl}The nearby monsters are quite hostile so we'd better be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003825	Urgh, strangely, I feel very tired and worn out.{nl}Could this be the doings of the Order?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003826	That's bizarre... {nl}The moment we got here, I feel light-headed and cannot think straight...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003827	I am weakened now... but I must protect the abbey...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003828	Could you look into this phenomenon? My body is not ready nor responding well {nl}How about you, Revelator? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003829	Perhaps, could you ask pilgrims around to see what is going on?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003830	Thank you...{nl}Please, listen to the people here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003831	My body is getting heavier by the minute.{nl}What is going on...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003832	It's becoming more difficult to think... I can feel it...{nl}Alright, let's summarize...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003833	The black crystal in the shrine erected in Shinikti Vacant Lot is said to be casting out monsters.{nl}The Order of the Tree of Truth claimed that this is a holy object and the drowsiness one feels is the blessings from the Tree.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003834	And by every night, it turns to the goddess?{nl}I'm getting curious.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003835	The black crystal is very valuable to the Order. {nl}If we break it, Domantas is sure to come.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003836	Please.{nl}Destroy the black crystal...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003837	If you think about it, leaving such an important artifact undefended must mean, it is hard to destroy.{nl}If it is demon-made, surely the divine power can break it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003838	Please, take my rosary.{nl}Its divine power will weaken the crystal. If so, it will become breakable.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003839	Please, place my rosary in front of the black crystal and destroy the crystal.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003840	Thank you, I feel much better.{nl}Just as I expected, the believers of the Order will come out to check.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003841	The true face of the Order is slowly getting revealed.{nl}The truth shall soon be known.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003842	What was that black crystal?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003843	The campside is quite noisy.{nl}They must be coming.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003844	{nl}I will expose the demon with the mirror. I leave the rest up to you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003845	Revelator, you are amazing!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003846	Since Domantas is a demon, it is most likely that the other officers are demons too.{nl}Especially, Deimantas the one who leads.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003847	Now, we'd better prepare to get inside the abbey...{nl}I don't have the key. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003848	We must find the one who handles the keys of the abbey.{nl}He ran in direction of Oasseu Memorial. Better find him there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003849	I'll meet you there.{nl}Please come to the Oasseu Memorial.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003850	Even this place was taken by the Order and Demons.{nl}What do you think they were trying to do here?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003851	There is a legend stating that the Oasseu Tree had been planted by Maven.{nl}Maybe that's why the Oasseu Tree didn't harm people even on Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003852	You're here.{nl}I couldn't find the Brother... who managed the keys.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003853	I'm worried that he's been taken by the demons.{nl}There... there is also a strange feeling about this place.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003854	This is a place where the holiest have been buried.{nl}That's why it was always filled with divine power... But I can't feel any of it now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003855	I think that we'll need to find out what happened.{nl}Then we can go look for the Brother.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003856	Thank you.{nl}Please check to see if there is anything amiss at the Hermit's Tomb.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003857	What happened...{nl}I can't even imagine what they were after.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003858	A strange device is emitting a dark energy?{nl}I see... The Order must be suppressing the divine power with that device.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003859	I don't know what the Order of the Tree of Truth is after...{nl}But I suspect that this place has also been taken over by the Order,{nl} and the Brother must have been taken by them as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003860	Let's lure them out as we did before.{nl}I'm sure the Order will appear if we destroy their devices.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003861	If we think about the Black Crystal at Rasvoy Lake...{nl}I think the divine power will be enough.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003862	Take this bottle and go to the Oasseu Tree.{nl}It grew under the influence of the divine power for a long time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003863	Spray the Order's Device with the Tree's Sap.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003864	Please get some of the Oasseu Tree's Sap and spray it on the Divine Power Suppression Devices.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003865	Have you destroyed the Device?{nl}I can feel the divine power returning to this region...{nl} I don't think the Order has noticed yet.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003866	Let's keep trying.{nl}There must be another device since the divine power hasn't fully returned.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003867	This is the abbey's land and in turn the Order's land as the abbey is now under our influence.{nl}Please do not disturb us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003868	People cannot endure times like these with contemporary beliefs.{nl}Yes... Maybe the goddesses wanted you to follow the Order.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003869	The next place where a device might be...{nl}It will probably be near the tomb at Rijekavi Fields.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003870	I hope I am right...{nl}Could you please destroy another Device to try and lure the people from the Order?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003871	The plan is the same as before.{nl}Gather Sap from the Oasseu Tree and spray it on the Device.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003872	I hope we will be able to find the Brother this time...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003873	Halt! Was it you?{nl}Are you the one that has been destroying the Order's Holy Devices?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003874	I don't know what you are up to, but you had better stop.{nl}This is the holy ground of Maven Abbey!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003875	Please do not handle the devices if you are not from the abbey or the Order.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003876	Wait... Did you just say Stella?{nl}I don't know where you heard that name, but she can't be alive.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003877	I saw her being chased by Demons with my own two eyes!{nl}Do not dare to defile the name of the deceased.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003878	I don't know who the imposter is, but she cannot be alive.{nl}I wish to see for myself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003879	Take me to this person who you call Stella.{nl}You cannot touch the device before that.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003880	I am sad to hear that we have lost the Brother...{nl} But we have someone within the Order that can help us.{nl}We have to hurry if it is only for the Brother who is now back with the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003881	Thank you.{nl}I will pray that you will be well rewarded for this.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003882	Don't you think that you should learn more about the Order instead of simply being hostile towards it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003883	Those Devices must all be destroyed.{nl}If only for the Brother who is no longer with us...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003884	I cannot forgive the Order.{nl}Please return to Rijekavi Fields once more.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003885	You already know the location, correct?{nl}Good luck.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003886	How could they do this?{nl}The Order... How...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003887	Good job.{nl}Things seem to be going extremely well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003888	Come to think of it...{nl}I think it would be better if we do not destroy any more of the devices.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003889	That's strange...{nl}I can't seem to find High Officer Medea anywhere.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003890	Are you sure you will be okay on your own?{nl}Don't you think we'll need more help to retake the abbey?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003891	I will watch Medea so that she can't go anywhere.{nl}She won't be able to escape the magic circle as long as she's human.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003892	Revelator, I leave the fate of the abbey in your hands.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003893	Re... Revelator...{nl}She... has escaped... Ugh...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003894	Ah... That is correct. {nl}Of course you could also stop their plans by destroying the device.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003895	But don't you think that it is a bit wasteful to do so?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003896	At times like these... It is sometimes better to use their powers against them.{nl}With these magic scrolls.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003897	This Scroll allows you to transfrom all energies into divine power.{nl}You will be able to use this scroll to make the Divine Power Supression Device release large amount of divine power.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003898	You will help me of course... won't you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003899	I was certain that you would help me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003900	What are you doing?{nl}Hurry to Krasjia Hill.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003901	Ah, Revelator.{nl}I can't seem to find Medea anywhere.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003902	By the way, how many devices have you destroyed?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003903	What? {nl}Stella gave you those Scrolls to use on the device?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003904	That's odd.{nl}Of course Stella is the abbey's librarian so she would know Scrolls that I don't know about but..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003905	I haven't heard anything about such Scrolls.{nl}I'm suspicious but... She should know better...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003906	However, I think you should take some Oasseu Tree Sap just in case.{nl}Just in case.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003907	Have you still not started on your journey?{nl}You have to hurry to stop the Order's scheme.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003908	I hope I'm worrying about nothing but..{nl}Remember to take the Oasseu Tree Sap just in case.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003909	I don't have anything else.{nl}I surrender.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003910	{nl}The only ability I have is to show illusions you know.{nl}I'll tell you anything you want so please go easy on me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003911	Impressive. Now what are you going to do to me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003912	What do you think I'll be able to do in this situation?{nl}Relax.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003913	Is this how you learned to treat the defenseless? How rude.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003914	Restraints, a Magic Circle and a guard..?{nl}You don't have to fear me so much you know.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003915	Wait a second. {nl}Please don't think I'm on the same level as Deimantas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003916	I am a human. {nl}You won't hurt another human would you now?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003917	I'll tell you where Stella is as well as hand over the Abbey key if you let me go.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003918	Is there someone else that will guard me?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003919	Fine, whatever.{nl}Then let's go meet him then.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003920	I never imagined that you'd capture Medea. {nl}You are more capable than I had thought.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003921	I'll restrain her so she won't be able to run away.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003922	Medea! What did you do to Stella?{nl}If anything has happened to her, I don't know what I'll do!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003923	Let's see...{nl}All I did was to have her captured and taken to the vacent lot left of Stjeva Intersection.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003924	How would I know if something has happened to her since then?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003925	Are you sure you can trust this guard?{nl}I don't know. I don't trust him too much but... Fine, have it your way.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003926	Revelator! {nl} Stella seems to be held near Stjeva Intersection.{nl}Please save her! I'll stand guard here to make sure that nothing happens!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003927	Please!{nl}I'll be watching Medea.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003928	Stella might be suffering a great deal even at this moment!{nl}Please hurry!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003929	I don't know what the demon might be doing to her.{nl}You might want to hurry you know?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003930	Thank you, Revelator...{nl}I don't know how many times you've saved my life...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003931	After you went to Rijekavi Fields, I suddenly couldn't see anything...{nl}When I woke up, I had already been captured...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003932	We don't have time for this. We have to go and retake the abbey!{nl}I'll see you at the base of the Oasseu Tree!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003933	Now that you have the key, all that is left is to take care of Medea before going to the abbey.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003934	I thought all of the Order's high officers were demons after seeing Domantas...{nl}I never thought that there would be people that had volunteered to help the demon.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003935	Now we have to retake the abbey.{nl}Medea will manage to escape if we just leave her like this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003936	I just thought of a good idea.{nl}I'm thinking of creating a Restrainment Magic Circle with the remaining power of the Divine Power Suppression Device Fragments.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003937	If I use the power remaining in the fragments... {nl}I'm sure we'll be able to hold Medea until we retake the abbey.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003938	Thank you so much.{nl}I don't know what would have happened if I had not met you...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003939	The Divine Power Suppression Device was at the Hermit's Tomb, Rijekavi Fields and Krasjia Hill.{nl}Please get two fragments from each place.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003940	Please help me prepare to activate the magic circle.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003941	She first asks you to destroy them and now she wants you to gather their Fragments.{nl}Isn't she being to demanding just because you're a Revelator?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003942	{nl}You won't have to do anything of the sort if you help me out.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003943	The preparations are complete. Go and tell Sister Stella that the magic circle is ready to be activated.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003944	Remote Tombstone
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003945	Maven prophesized that this road will always be threatened by the demons.{nl}I now go to rest after completing my mission but am worried about who will now stop the Demon threat.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003946	If someone honorable happens to pass and defeat the demons{nl}they will have my enternal thanks even if I had returned to the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003947	A warm light emits from the tomb as if to give a blessing.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003948	After talking to Brother Mattas, it seems as if the abbey is in more trouble than I had thought.{nl}There are even demons and monsters roaming around inside.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003949	Please deal with the monsters in front of the abbey.{nl}I'll wait for the chance to open the doors.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003950	I won't be able to open the doors until there are less monsters.{nl}Good luck.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003951	I was able to hear some information from Medea.{nl}It seems as if High Officer Deimantas is at the Hall of Honor.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003952	It seems like they have raised a Barrier and are defiling the Divine Power of the abbey to use as their own.{nl}Of course, we can't believe Medea's word at face value, so we'll have to check for ourselves.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003953	We won't be able to stop High Officer Deimantas if we don't break this barrier.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003954	We also have to save the others that have been captured... I keep getting nervous.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003955	We'll have to see what type of barrier it is first.{nl}Could you please get me to the Barrier?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003956	Shall we?{nl}Please be careful of the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003957	Ah... It seems like Medea was telling the truth afterall.{nl}We'll have to find a way to get through here in order to stop Deimantas.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003958	I remember seeing a Ancient Book about Demon Barriers.{nl}Could you please protect me while a look for it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003959	I found it!{nl}But... I'll need some time while I look for where the information about this particular barrier is.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003960	I'll try to find it as fast as I can, but please keep the Demons off of me one more time.{nl}I'm counting on you!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003961	It took longer than I thought because the information was in the latter half of the book.{nl}All we have left is to get rid of this barrier.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003962	First, we need something to hold the divine power.{nl}Could you get an Orb from beneath the Stoup while I finish the spell?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003963	I'll be completing the spell here as is mentioned in the book.{nl}May the goddesses bless you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003964	Just a second... This is an extremely complicated spell...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003965	Yes. This orb should do nicely.{nl}The spell is just about ready as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003966	Now we have to gather the divine power in this orb.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003967	Maybe the Central Fountain... {nl}There may be some divine power there even if Deimantas is trying to use all of the divine power in the abbey.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003968	Of course I'll do the gathering.{nl}Just take me to the Central Fountain in once piece.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003969	They have become too weak to even wimper.{nl}We need to help them recover their strength.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003970	The only reason I was able to save them is thanks to you Revelator.{nl}Thank you so much.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003971	It's finished!{nl}Now let's go and find Deimantas!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003972	Are you ready?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003973	Finally... The abbey has been retaken from the grasp of the Order of the Tree of Truth.{nl}This was all possible thanks to you!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003974	I saw the barrier on the upper rooms disappear as soon as Deimantas was defeated.{nl}I went there because I suspected that there may be some of my captured colleagues and there they were..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160811_003975	I'm worried because their condition is far weaker than I thought.

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004956	Either activating secret devices to attack demons... {nl}Or destroy demon devices or magic circles. Do whatever you seem fit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004957	Huh?{nl}A human... here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004958	Are you...{nl}...the Revelator?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004959	{nl}It's you!{nl}I and the other Kupoles have all heard about you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004960	I'm investigating the Three-Layered Castle Wall with the other Kupoles.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004961	The wall was built a millennium ago after the prediction of Goddess Laima.{nl}We didn't know what it meant then...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004962	But I started to wonder about the true purpose of the wall...{nl}And so now we're looking for clues about the goddess' prediction.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004963	Unfortunately it isn't easy investigating with all these monsters around.{nl}But we did discover something.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004964	We found one of the many unknown devices hidden here.{nl}We were investigating it just now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004965	{nl}I wonder if you could help...{nl}Anything related to Goddess Laima's prediction ought to help you too, isn't it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004966	I knew we could count on you!{nl}Thank you!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004967	I will give you something to note down the clues.{nl}Write down anything you find in here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004968	Maybe you can start with... the warehouse in District 8?{nl}There ought to be many things to look at there.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004969	You might find things like broken magic circles and magic stones there.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004970	Are you back?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004971	{nl}Hm... 
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004972	{nl}Those magic circles and stones can't have been for defending the castle...{nl}There must have been some other purpose to them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004973	Let's gather some more clues.{nl}If we find enough useful traces, they could lead us to an important clue.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004974	You can go to the document archive.{nl}I'll go and look somewhere else.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004975	Meet me here again after the investigation.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004976	You're back.{nl}Did you find anything useful?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004977	{nl}Shall we have a look, then?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004978	You've collected a lot of materials.{nl}I think we can work something out from this.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004979	Let me show you what I found first.{nl}Tell me what you think.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004980	Then the wall was built to prepare for Medzio Diena...{nl}We should have listened to Goddess Laima then...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004981	{nl}Truth is, there is nothing we can do about it now...{nl}If anything, you should tell my fellow Kupole in District 9 about the wall.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004982	{nl}The Kupole working there is called Liepa.{nl}Please go and tell her.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004983	Are you here to see me?{nl}Who might you be?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004984	The Revelator!{nl}Yes, do tell me more.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004985	So the wall was to prepare us for Medzio Diena...{nl}If you were able to find that much in District 8, you might be able to find something here as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004986	{nl}Would you investigate a little further with us?{nl}We want to know how the preparations for Medzio Diena took place.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004987	To investigate Inner Wall District 9 you'll need some documents from the Command Room.{nl}The problem is the room is occupied by monsters, so it won't be easy to access.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004988	You'll join our investigation?{nl}That's wonderful, thank you!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004989	{nl}In the Command Room, you'll find record documents with information about the installations.{nl}You may bring them to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004990	Just be careful, the monsters there are vicious.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004991	The records...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004992	{nl}Oh, you've found them!{nl}Let me have a look.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004993	According to these records, there should be some places nearby worthy of investigating.{nl}Also...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004994	{nl}While I read the rest of the documents, will you find me a Scroll of Projection?{nl}We will need one to continue our investigations.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004995	I'll be sorting out important information from these documents meanwhile.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004996	The records might be able to tell us where to look next.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004997	Good to see you found it.{nl}I was actually worried it had disappeared.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004998	{nl}To tell you the truth, there weren't as many monsters when we first started investigating.{nl}That's why we didn't take the Scroll of Projection right away.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_004999	{nl}But then, just when we needed to use it, the monsters had already taken over...{nl}I'm glad you were here to help this time!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005000	I've marked all the sites we need to search and all the important information on the documents.{nl}You may use it to continue investigating.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005001	And do take the scroll of projection with you.{nl}You'll need it to investigate the first item, the Impact Absorption Magic Circle.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005002	I'll just finish preparing some things and then go the opposite direction.{nl}Meet me after the investigation.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005003	Things sure are moving along more quickly with you here, Revelator...{nl}You truly are amazing.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005004	You've returned.{nl}I've also just arrived.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005005	{nl}Did you search all the sites I noted?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005006	We should be able to induce something from here.{nl}Let's have a look.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005007	This means the castle wall wasn't enough for Medzio Diena.{nl}All the preparations were done, they just weren't used correctly, it seems.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005008	{nl}But I wonder what went wrong, exactly.{nl}We must have missed something.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005009	I do have a hunch about one location.{nl}I haven't been able to investigate it yet because of the monsters but...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005010	{nl}I wonder what else is left there.{nl}The meeting room over there.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005011	The monsters made a complete mess out of that meeting room.{nl}They could very well be holding clues... Would you hunt them?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005012	They knew the date, and they were ready, but nothing was set in motion...{nl}The preparations for Medzio Diena, that is.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005013	{nl}It all seems very strage.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005014	These are... written orders.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005015	But it's strange.{nl}No matter how I read them, I can't understand these orders.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005016	{nl}It's almost as if they were trying to separate the people managing and protecting this land.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005017	{nl}It looks like someone might have interfered with the plans on purpose.{nl}If these orders were meant to stop the preparations for Medzio Diena from being carried out...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005018	That means the wall core shown in those classified manuals must contain something important.{nl}Go to Outer Wall District 9 and show the manual to the Kupole there.{nl}Her name is Milda.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005019	Kupole Milda
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005020	So this wall was built to prepare for Medzio Diena...{nl}But for some unknown reason the preparations weren't carried out as they should.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005021	{nl}Oh, sorry, I didn't even introduce myself.{nl}I'm Milda, I'm in charge of investigating Outer Wall District 9.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005022	{nl}As you know, in this area there's something called the core.{nl}We think investigating this core will tell us the reason why the preparations for Medzio Diena never took place.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005023	{nl}The problem is that the core is highly protected, and for several other reasons... It hasn't been easy investigating it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005024	Yes.{nl}That's why I need to be careful around here.{nl}We can talk more after the monsters' numbers have been reduced a little.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005025	I'm worried about the monsters.{nl}There's something else going on here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005026	We'll never see the end of it at this pace.{nl}Something keeps attracting monsters to Outer Wall District 9.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005027	{nl}There must a reason for it to happen...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005028	I'll give you my investigation notes.{nl}I recorded everything in them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005029	It's hard for me to move around because of the monsters...{nl}But you should be able to investigate the core using my notes and the equipment manual.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005030	Just be careful.{nl}More and more strong monsters are gathering.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005031	What could be making the monsters gather like that?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005032	You've brought the core!{nl}I can feel the strong energy of Goddess Laima in it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005033	{nl}This looks powerful enough to destroy the entire castle wall...{nl}But...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005034	{nl}Something feels strange.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005035	{nl}There is demon energy in this.{nl}This means the core was contaminated by evil energy after it was created...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005036	{nl}It must have been the demons!{nl}You must tell Jore about this!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005037	I'll stay here and look for a way to purify the core.{nl}This may very well be our key to ridding the world of the Divine Tree.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005038	Did you find anything else?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005039	I hope the power of Laima in the core can still be restored...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005040	A core containing Laima's powerful energy...{nl}But you say it was contaminated with evil energy?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005041	{nl}Looking at your notes, you seem to have found a lot.{nl}Let's get them organized, then.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005042	Let's see what we have so far.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005043	Goddess Laima predicted Medzio Diena... and the castle wall was built to prepare for it...{nl}But the demons prevented any measures from being put into practice...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005044	{nl}I wonder if you coming here and helping us discover this information was also in her predictions...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005045	{nl}Us Kupoles must now purify the dark magic inside the core.{nl}If we can use the power of Laima in the core, we may just find something to use against the Divine Tree.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005046	{nl}On behalf of all of us, I would like to thank you for letting Laima lead you to us, Revelator.{nl}You'll come see us again, won't you?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005047	I'm very certain that there is something hidden in the castle wall.{nl}That is what I am investigating.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005048	Ah... We should have all listened to Goddess Laima then...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005049	In any case, Her predictions aren't final.{nl}The actions of humans can always produce different outcomes.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005050	{nl}In my opinion, predictions can never be definitive.{nl}Only an extremely passive and apathetic being can be predicted with absolute certainty.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005051	Not even Goddess Laima's predictions are definitive.{nl}The actions of humans can always produce different outcomes.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005052	{nl}If you think about it, predictions can never be definitive.{nl}Only an extremely passive and apathetic being can be predicted with absolute certainty.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005053	{nl}In any case I believe that might be the reason why Laima put Her trust in humans.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005054	What could have happened here at the castle wall...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005055	I can't believe the demons had a hand in this...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005056	The clues we found at Inner Wall District 8 are important evidence, we should show them to the other Kupoles.{nl}I'm worried that the monsters will try and damage them, though.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005057	Will you?{nl}Thank you, I'm really glad you can help.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005058	I can see why Goddess Laima chose you, Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005059	Thank you.{nl}That should be enough.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005060	You're in danger here.{nl}Hurry up and leave.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005061	What Evoniphon did can never be forgiven.{nl}For the sake of those who died in his hands, you must...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005062	Come see me if you meet anyone working for the kingdom.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005063	I'd be glad to see you again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005064	Supply Soldier's Spirit
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005065	I thought there was no one left here but other spirits wandering away from the goddess...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005066	{nl}But if you're here, won't you listen to my request?{nl}Before I died I was a supply soldier, I transported materials to the castle wall.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005067	{nl}I was on my way to transporting some goods requested by the families of the soldiers working at the castle wall.{nl}That day was Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005068	{nl}I died that day... and so did all the soldiers at the wall...{nl}The goods I was transporting are still strewn around Uzsmirsote Way...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005069	{nl}I would like to deliver the supplies I was transporting then to the soldiers who died with me.{nl}If you can... Would you gather those supplies?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005070	Thank you.{nl}You will see the boxes containing the supplies spread around Uzsmirsote Way.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005071	{nl}I would help find them if I could, but after I became a spirit I'm unable to move away from here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005072	Even in the care of the goddess, those soldiers' objects will mean something to them.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005073	Did you gather them all?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005074	Hm... Is this all there was...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005075	I suppose with time a lot of them went missing.{nl}Most of the boxes seem to be gone now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005076	I've seen the monsters go through the boxes sometimes...{nl}They must have stolen some of the supplies.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005077	Would you search the monsters for other supplies, too?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005078	Sigh... I'm really sorry to be asking this to a stranger.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005079	A lot of soldiers in this area didn't survive Medzio Diena, as far as I can tell.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005080	Yes, this is everything as I remember it.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005081	{nl}I will take these supplies and return to the goddess now.{nl}Finally I can complete my last mission.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005082	Castle Wall Soldier's Spirit
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005083	Hey. What's a human doing here...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005084	I used to be a soldier working here at the castle wall.{nl}As you can see I kicked the can and all that's left is my spirit now...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005085	So many other soldiers I used to work with didn't make it...{nl}No idea what happened to those guys now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005086	I want to think they're with the goddess, but what if they're not, you know?{nl}So I was thinking, would you do me and my buddies a favor?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005087	You're a... nice fellow, aren't you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005088	I wanna help guide their spirits to the goddess.{nl}But as you can see, I can't move much in this state.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005089	Okay. First, if you go to Deengo Hill, you'll see their stuff lying around.{nl}Just bring it all over.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005090	Can you believe they left without even taking their stuff?{nl}Not that it's any of my business but...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005091	Did you bring the stuff?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005092	Now, here's what you to do next.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005093	There's a sanctum in Kule Peak that's full of forest energy.{nl}I want you to dump the stuff into the sanctum and pull all that forest energy to get the sanctum running.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005094	{nl}It's what they do to soldiers who die at the castle wall, after gathering all their remains and stuff.{nl}Like a memorial service, you know?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005095	{nl}I know it's been a long time now, but it's the least I can do.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005096	Okay, but first you need to find this sanctum.{nl}The forest energy went a little crazy after Medzio Diena so I can't be sure where it is anymore.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005097	There's gonna be a place in Kule Center where you can really feel the forest energy.{nl}It's gonna be stronger than in any other spot around there.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005098	It was by the water, if I'm not mistaken...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005099	You did it.{nl}My buddies are gonna thank you for this.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005100	{nl}Glad I finally got that out of my chest, guess I'll be going to the goddess now.{nl}Thanks a lot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005101	Scout Soldier's Spirit
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005102	There are many soldiers whose lives were sacrificed on Medzio Diena here.{nl}I am one of them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005103	{nl}But there's something I can't let go of until this day.{nl}That's why I still haven't found my way to the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005104	{nl}I was on my way to scout Kule Peak when I saw something...{nl}The shock of dying must have been too great, because I can't remember very well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005105	{nl}I wrote everything on my report, but it's lost now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005106	Thank you so much for helping me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005107	Some time ago I saw the monsters at the Dead-End Road carrying around scraps of paper.{nl}I think they're from my report.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005108	You should be able to find some if you search the monsters there.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005109	It's funny how I remember the moment I died so vividly.{nl}I would rather have forgotten it...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005110	Yes, that's it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005111	Let's see...{nl}Hmm...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005112	Oh, I remember!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005113	{nl}I noticed some sculptures scattered in Sugrizimas Way.{nl}They were glowing and giving off a strange energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005114	I didn't know what they were, so I didn't try to handle them, but I was going to report it to my superiors.{nl}I suppose there's no one to report it to now, so why don't we investigate ourselves?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005115	I hope I'll finally be able to solve this mystery.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005116	First, go to Sugrizimas Way and collect the glowing sculptures.{nl}We should be able to find out something about them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005117	Run if you see anything that looks dangerous.

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005120	The divine bead of Kule Peak.{nl}It looks broken, but I'm certain this is it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005121	This was at the goddess' altar which was forgotten after the castle wall was built.{nl}I heard it had belonged to a goddess who no one remembers.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005122	It's a shame an object like this has ended up broken.{nl}It should be restored and placed back on the altar.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005123	It should be more resistant now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005124	{nl}It would be best to clear out some monsters near the altar first, just to be safe.{nl}Defeat the monsters in Lychimas Fields before returning the bead to the altar.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005125	{nl}It's time for me to return to the goddess now.{nl}Thank you for helping me resolve my issue.

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005171	{nl}I guess, for people who lost everything, anywhere will be hard.{nl}This world or another world, does it make a difference?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005172	The forest isn't dying.{nl}The foliage is what's keeping the trees safe from the vegetation problem.{nl}But one Kupole hasn't figured that out yet.

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005174	So Victoras wants to know the contents of the document...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005175	The situation in Nheto Forest had been reported to affect the minds of refugees in nearby areas as well.{nl}I thought it was important to study the forest and the irregularities in it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005176	{nl}And so, as a user of time magic myself, I formulated a hypothesis.{nl}I sent out Ida to investigate based on that hypothesis.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005177	{nl}I will reorganize the information in this report.{nl}Please let Ida know on your way back.

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005186	The Tri-Layered Castle Wall is composed of the inner, outer and central walls.{nl}As I mentioned before, it was built under the instruction of Goddess Laima.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005187	{nl}The other Kupoles and I were investigating the wall.{nl}We figured there must be something hidden there, a clue to the truth.

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005189	{nl}My legs may be mangled but I will find out where my brother is, so help me the goddess!

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005197	We couldn't just stand by and look as the forest withered on.

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005200	There, it's finished.{nl}I had to rush it so it's a little rough; please be careful with it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005201	The seeds... they look different.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005202	Oscaras?said he was going to get Vink flowers and left.{nl}And the symptoms keep getting worse... I hope nothing happens.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005203	Oscaras is gone.{nl}We should go find him.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005204	I'm tired beyond exhaustion.{nl}I didn't know it would be this hard...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005205	According to the legends, the Flower of Vaivora will only bloom before a very special aura.{nl}So I brought it here hoping to find somewhat special people but...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005206	{nl}All I found were frauds and con artists.{nl}This whole ordeal has been more than tiring...

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005211	{nl}Oh... Well if that's so...{nl}Will you listen to my story?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005212	{nl}After Medzio Diena, the goddesses would no longer answer our prayers.{nl}Because of this, many started to doubt or deny the very existence of the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005213	{nl}I, for one, was certain that there must be a reason why the goddesses weren't answering.{nl}A legend is told of a flower that grows in Arcus Forest. Ask this flower anything, and it will answer you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005214	{nl}This flower is called Vaivora's Koru.{nl}I came here to make Vaivora's Koru bloom and find out where the goddesses are.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005215	{nl}But now... I don't even know where its seeds are...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005216	You're right!{nl}Those could be the seeds of Vaivora's Koru!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005217	{nl}To tell the truth... Having the seeds alone isn't enough to make the flower bloom.{nl}According to the legend, the special one must hold the seeds in their hand and submerge them in a pool of water to claim them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005218	{nl}If that's you...!{nl}You, the revelator...!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005219	{nl}Down here is a puddle of water.{nl}Go there and submerge the seeds!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005220	If you really are the special one told in the legend, the seeds will react and change.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005221	Oh... The seeds have been claimed...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005222	{nl}The legend became true!{nl}After all the frauds and tricks...!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005223	The legend says that, once claimed, the seeds will feed off the energy of the special one.{nl}They will disappear if touched by anyone other than the special one.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005224	{nl}Won't you help me grow Vaivora's Koru?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005225	Go to Juzmitas Altar and plant the seeds there.{nl}The legend says Vaivora's Koru requires divine energy to blossom.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005226	{nl}In the past, Arcus Forest was the place where worshipping ceremonies for Goddess Vaivora were held.{nl}Some of that divine energy is still present in the altar.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005227	{nl}Go there and plant the seeds.{nl}I will go first.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005228	{nl}Moving around hasn't been easy because of the monsters, but I feel safe with you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005229	Oh... I'm afraid the divine energy here won't be enough for Vaivora's Koru...{nl}It seems to have been damaged...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005230	And fully repairing the altar would take far too much time.{nl}Unless...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005231	{nl}Hm, yes.{nl}Around this altar there are several remains of collapsed stone pillars.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005232	{nl}Those pillars were used to cleanse away evil energies during worshiping ceremonies to Goddess Vaivora.{nl}They may be only remains, but some of their past divine energy will still be present.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005233	{nl}If we could find a way to transfer the divine energy from the pillars to the altar...{nl}We may be able to restore its power.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005234	You've collected the Lyecorn essence.{nl}This should be enough for the orb.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005235	{nl}We'll need to purify the evil energy, but I can do that myself.{nl}I might need more materials, however...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005236	I will cleanse the Lyecorn essence and transfer the divine energy from the pillar remains to the altar.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005237	This much should suffice.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005238	There is one more thing I need to purify the Lyecorn essence...{nl}Arcus braken, the type that grows in Arcus Forest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005239	The stems of Arcus bracken are covered in dense hairs and they're very firm.{nl}Stems that have been steeped in divine energy can purify evil forces.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005240	Arcus braken seemed to grow mostly at the Meilan Intersection.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005241	I'll use this Arcus bracken to purify the Lyecorn essence.{nl}Just a moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005242	The Lyecorn essence is now purified and the orb is completed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005243	Now you'll need to imbue the essence with divine energy.{nl}Use it near the pillar fragments and an orb of divine energy will appear.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005244	{nl}The orb will contain the divine energy in the essence and transmit it.{nl}If the orb disappears, you'll need to use more of the essence.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005245	{nl}I will stay at the altar and prepare it for the energy transmission.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005246	Use the essence near the pillar fragments.{nl}The orb that appears in the essence will deliver the divine energy contained in them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005247	You've brought the divine energy.{nl}I am also finished with preparations.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005248	I have created a magic circle to transfer the divine energy from the essence to the altar.{nl}You can place the essence onto the magic circle.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005249	{nl}Also, don't forget to plant the Koru seeds!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005250	After you place the essence on the magic circle, the divine energy will move towards the altar.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005251	The essence is placed on the magic circle, but it doesn't react...{nl}I don't think there's anything wrong with the circle...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005252	{nl}What could be the problem...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005253	Oh, when you were placing the essence on the magic circle, that flower over there looked a little strange.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005254	{nl}Would you...{nl}Remove that flower for me?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005255	It looks suspicious somehow.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005256	A flower that draws divine energy, how strange...{nl}My life would have been in danger if it weren't for you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005257	{nl}The claimed seeds have started to react as told in the legend.{nl}Soon the Flower of Vaivora will bloom.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005258	{nl}I will pray now and ask to know the whereabouts of the goddesses.{nl}Help me so I may focus on my prayer.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005259	Vaivora's Koru has answered me and told me about the goddesses.{nl}I'm sure you too will want to know where they are.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005260	Of course.{nl}I will tell you where the goddesses are.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005261	You have strengthened my faith in the goddesses ever so more.{nl}I will now find a way to prove to the people what the Koru has revealed!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005262	{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005263	In the past, Phamer Forest was affected by a deadly disease that caused high fevers.{nl}This disease was never completely eradicated, so you should avoid staying long.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005264	{nl}I am researching the period when the disease first struck.{nl}I'm doing so as a pupil of the Plague Doctor Master, who investigates infectious diseases himself...

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005266	{nl}If it's alright, do you mind if I share my predicament?{nl}My research hasn't really been leading anywhere, and it's making me miserable...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005267	{nl}The information I was given when I first arrived was far too little.{nl}Date of occurrence, number of casualties, symptoms... that was it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005268	{nl}It was impossible arriving at any conclusions with this little information...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005269	{nl}All I learned was that the disease started manifesting differently after Medzio Diena.{nl}In this state, if I don't talk to someone about this I feel as if the disease will take over my own self...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005270	I feel much better knowing someone is willing to help.{nl}Though I understand you have no knowledge of the disease...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005271	{nl}Oh, by the way.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005272	{nl}I should tell you something before we start.{nl}We don't know how one becomes infected with this disease, so you must be careful at all times.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005273	{nl}Alright, first we need to collect substances likely to cause the disease to occur.{nl}You may bring some Bunkeybo and Bunkeyto skins, along with Phamer bracken and Tulups.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005274	{nl}You'll find Phamer bracken and Tulups growing by the Atvis Falls, to the right side of the camp.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005275	There will be plenty of Phamer bracken and Tulups by the Atvis Falls.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005276	This should be enough to study the causes of the disease.{nl}Alright, now...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005277	We need test subjects that we can put in contact with the materials you collected.{nl}There are a few monsters I selected as subjects; I would like you to bring them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005278	I would like Bunkeytos and Bunkeybos to use as test subjects and some water.{nl}You may bring the water from the Atvis Falls nearby, but the monsters need to be hunted.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005279	{nl}Use this tranquilizer on monsters after weakening them.{nl}It will knock them down instantly so you should have no trouble capturing them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005280	While you gather the test subjects, I will make a cage for the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005281	The cage for the monsters is completed.

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005284	Have the Bunkeybo smell the Phamer bracken.{nl}Then feed the Tulup flower to the Bunkeyto.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005285	Meanwhile I'll be observing the substances released from the monsters' skin.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005286	Let's wait and see how the monsters react.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005287	I ran some tests and... My condition doesn't seem right...{nl}I think I might have been infected with the disease...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005288	{nl}This can't be happening...{nl}I can't have this disease...{nl}I must have made a mistake checking the results.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005289	{nl}I can't be sick... I was so careful...{nl}It can't be!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005290	{nl}No!

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005293	{nl}Did...{nl}... you have the Bunkeybo smell the Phamer bracken?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005294	{nl}The last time I tested there was no reaction, but this time the disease manifested.{nl}It seems the substances that cause the disease are found in some of the Phamer bracken.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005295	{nl}I would like you to bring me all the Phamer bracken you can, in all stages of development.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005296	I'm planning to separate the bracken into younger specimens and more developed ones to test.{nl}I'm really glad to have someone here to help me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005297	{nl}If this were to happen when I was all alone...{nl}I can't even imagine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005298	I'll analyse the bracken.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005299	I've got the test results.{nl}It seems the spores of developed bracken are harmless to the human body.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005300	{nl}But in the respiratory system of Bunkeybos, they become deadly.{nl}Humans who are bitten by them or otherwise come into contact with their bodily fluids can become infected as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005301	As for the cure... the answer is in the Bunkeytos!{nl}The disease still manifests in them, but I noticed it disappeared rather quickly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005302	{nl}It turns out the magic of Bunkeyto essence, when combined with another material, generates a substance that gives them immunity!{nl}This can be used to create a cure!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005303	I will just need to find out what the magic in the Bunkeyto essence is reacting with.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005304	I'm starting to have the symptoms.{nl}Be careful not to become infected yourself...

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005307	{nl}It's Vink flowers.{nl}The combination of these flowers and Bunkeyto essence creates an antidote.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005308	{nl}The problem is that creating enough antidote to cure one person requires a large amount of Vink flowers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005309	Vink flowers are scarce even in Phamer Forest, and they're rather hard to spot.{nl}However, when they react to Bunkeyto essence, a pearl of red light appears.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005310	{nl}If you use the magic in Bunkeyto essence, you'll be able to find Vink flowers where the pearls of light appear.{nl}Hurry on to Tarnis Falls.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005311	My symptoms are getting worse, I'm having difficulty standing up.{nl}It could be the fever... I'm getting chills too...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005312	{nl}You brought the Vink flowers.{nl}We need to go to back to camp to make the medicine, but in my condition...

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005315	The Bunkeyto essence and Vink flowers should be mixed in a ratio of 3:7.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005316	Did you finish the antidote?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005317	Oh, it seems the antidote is working already.{nl}I feel a lot better.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005318	{nl}I'm so thankful.{nl}You helped me progress so much in my research, and now I even have an antidote.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005319	{nl}If it weren't for you I would've been miserable with no such thing as a cure.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005320	{nl}I will go back to camp now and prepare to report everything to the Plague Doctor Master.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005321	No... We can't lose Dalia...

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005327	{nl}Use the orb on monsters and they'll be branded with something called the Seal of Disinter.{nl}Defeat the monsters with the seal and they'll leave behind a pool of magic infused blood.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005328	{nl}One thing, though. The Seal of Disinter goes away after a while, so remember that.{nl}And don't be too bummed if you don't see the seal, it can fail sometimes if you don't control your magic right.

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005435	{nl}To find out the secret history of these traces, the crystal of Goddess Gegute.{nl}The crystal allows you to see the past events of a place and nearby objects.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005436	{nl}Do you want to try it out here?{nl}I have already set the time period.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005437	{nl}It would be a mystical experience.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005438	How could he just abandon his duty as a servant of the kingdom?{nl}Our duty is to  protect the magic circle regardless of what happens.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005439	As a soldier, I feel uncomfortable receiving help from an ordinary person like you, but...{nl}Horace who was helping us is lying in the tent at the moment.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005440	Thank you for saving my life.{nl}I'm worried for the monastery, however. I wonder if my brothers are safe...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005441	I can't see my own breath, but I'm freezing.{nl}This doesn't make any sense. Brrrr...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005442	This is grave, we have demons hiding among our Order.{nl}You don't suppose our chiefs will know about this...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005443	We have reasons to believe this person is the culprit.{nl}Try and convince the other pilgrims if you believe otherwise.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005444	If you can't prove that this person is innocent...{nl}We have no choice but to leave their faith up to the monastery.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005445	That must have been a visual trickery. {nl}That brother was born in the Abbey and has lived there his entire life.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005446	Only a handful of brethren including me managed to escape... {nl}I am deathly worried about all of them. I have no way of knowing what happened to the others.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005447	Fine, whatever.{nl}Let's go meet him then.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005448	I... don't know who I am... or where I am.{nl}I simply remember the name Hayatin...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005449	I feel something I can't quite explain when I see those glowing monsters.{nl}For some reason, I feel as if there is someone I must save... but who...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005450	I believe we can restore Ruklys' honor if we reveal to the world the documents in his box.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005451	I beg of you.{nl}Please, find Ruklys' document box.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005452	I am forever thankful to you for proving Ruklys' innocence to the world.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005453	Soon the day will come when Ruklys and the rest of us are free of all false charges.{nl}I am eternally grateful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005454	Traveler.{nl}Will you listen to my story?{nl}Though I may remember nothing but the name Hayatin...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005455	{nl}Seeing the blue glowing monsters musters in me a feeling I can't quite explain.{nl}That is why I believe they're the key to recovering my memories.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005456	Thank you.{nl}Being dead, there is not much I can do...{nl}Please, defeat the Blue Tanus and Blue Doyors for me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005457	I remember it all!{nl}What's important to me... My duties...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005458	I am Hayatin, Ruklys' comrade.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005459	{nl}I was asleep for a long, long time, until I suddenly awoke four years ago.{nl}Alas, I did not know who I was or what I ought to do, so I merely wandered.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005460	{nl}But I remember it all now.{nl}I must find the document that proves Ruklys is innocent!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005461	{nl}Dead as I am, there isn't much I can do.{nl}Please, be my help.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005462	There was nearly no one left from Victoras' troops.{nl}However the document box could still be at the location where they were stationed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005463	{nl}I ask you to search Carejvines Hill, where his troops were stationed.{nl}I will be waiting at the place where we first met.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005464	Yes. I am Victoras, general of the kingdom.{nl}I should first of all thank you for setting me free from the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005465	{nl}I do not know what you seek in this decrepit place, but you have my help if you need it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005466	I had lost my sense of self and was running wild with the monsters like a beast.{nl}If anything I ought to thank you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005467	I wonder how many years have passed... Nothing looks the same as it once was.{nl}The bracken itself looks bizarre. What on earth happened here?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005468	The entire world looks to have perished before a devious calamity.{nl}You must wonder why, during such calamity, I would plot to dishonor a hero like Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005469	I was merely following orders as a member of the army, though it led to the disgrace of a hero.{nl}It was unfortunate.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005470	Hayatin... A name I missed.{nl}I do remember one of his subordinates handing me the document box.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005471	{nl}I will help you find the box.{nl}But first, there is something I must do.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005472	The spirits you see wandering nearby were once royal soldiers under my command.{nl}After conscription and a meaningless death, they seem to have been left wandering pointlessly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005473	{nl}As their superior, I feel like sending them to rest with the goddess is the least I can do.{nl}If it's not much to ask, would you build them a memorial stone?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005474	{nl}Something simple will suffice.{nl}There are remains from the castle wall you can use which ought to work just fine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005475	Use the materials from the ruins to raise a simple sign on a stone base.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005476	I simply want to honor them, rather than impress anyone.{nl}And I must say I'm grateful to you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005477	Now that the memorial stone is complete, would you guide their spirits to it?{nl}I don't think I should be the one to do it, seeing as I'm the one they likely resent.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005478	Thank you.{nl}I will tell you more after their spirits are resting in comfort.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005479	Please guide my subordinates' wandering spirits to the memorial stone.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005480	I cannot thank you enough.{nl}Let me start by telling you what I know about the document box.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005481	I willingly sacrificed my own life to follow the orders I was given.{nl}I believe my loyalty to the kingdom has been more than proven.{nl}There is no reason for me to keep any more secrets.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005482	{nl}I received orders from Premier Eminent to obtain an important object Hayatin had in his possession when he fled.{nl}After a long pursuit, one of his subordinates surrendered the document box to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005483	{nl}I hid the box under a sign only I recognize.{nl}The land may have changed with time, but I believe we can discover the box if only we find the sign.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005484	I'm afraid I can no longer be certain of its exact location.{nl}Although I know it is in Carejvines Hill...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005485	{nl}It will likely be in a spot with abundant bracken.{nl}I would start by burning the piles of bracken and checking for what's underneath them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005486	I, too, harbored my own suspicions about our quest to punish Ruklys.{nl}As the first disciple of Maven, he proved to be nothing less than a hero.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005487	{nl}But as members of the army, our very lives depend on our orders.{nl}From where I stood, I had no choice but to follow the directions of the Premier.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005488	{nl}It happened before the Fortress of the Land was overtook.{nl}We thought they were attacking, when it was confirmed that a detached force had fled southwards.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005489	{nl}It was Hayatin and his soldiers.{nl}Our mission to pursuit Hayatin had only gotten longer.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005490	{nl}Eventually one of his soldiers did surrender the document box to our side, but he could not be spared.{nl}You see, the Premier's second command was to eliminate all of Hayatin's forces.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005491	{nl}My first command was to deliver the box directly to the Premier.{nl}That is why I hid it in a place unknown even by my subordinates.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005492	It won't be easy skimming through the tangled bracken.{nl}Burning it is a better solution.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005493	{nl}If you do find the document box, there is something I want to ask.{nl}I'm curious about the contents of the document the Premier was so keen on keeping secret.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005494	{nl}If you will, please find out what the document contains. I want to know the truth.{nl}I want to know if Ruklys and Hayatin were in fact traitors...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005495	Time may have worn it out, but I have no doubts.{nl}This is the document box Hayatin had in his possession.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005496	If Hayatin seeks to recover this box, it is only right to return it to him.{nl}But first, I want to know the contents of the document.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005497	Would you perhaps open it for me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005498	As dead as I am, I'm afraid there isn't much I can do.{nl}If it's locked, we'll have no choice but to ask Hayatin.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005499	Did you find the document box?{nl}I'm very glad to hear that, but how exactly did you find it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005500	{nl}You were helped by the spirit of Victoras?{nl}Does that mean his spirit still lives?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005501	{nl}And he's seeking the truth about the past...?{nl}I can't say I resent him entirely, given that he was simply following orders...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005502	{nl}Very well.{nl}We need the document either way to prove Ruklys was innocent. Let us open the box, then.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005503	The inside of the box seems intact despite the years that passed.{nl}I can only imagine what important secrets it holds.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005504	{nl}I didn't imagine it to be locked like this. I never once tried to open it.{nl}I'm afraid we have no choice but to ask Hayatin.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005505	A key is required to open the document box.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005506	{nl}I held this key until the day I died.{nl}I imagine it will have remained buried with my dead body until this very day.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005507	{nl}But I'm afraid far too long has passed and I have forgotten where my body is buried.{nl}I believe it could be at Musiz Pond, where he and I fought our last battle...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005508	Fortunately, the document box is enchanted.{nl}It and the key will glow in each other's presence, to prevent the key from being lost.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005509	{nl}The Blue Gosarus that inhabit these lands are said to grow magic stones in their bodies.{nl}We may be able to use their stones to activate the document box.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005510	Obtain the magic stones from the Blue Gosarus and use the box by Musiz Pond.{nl}Should the key be buried nearby, it will react.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005511	You've found the key.{nl}Would you open the box and have a look at the document?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005512	The document seems intact. Indeed, it was sealed before it was buried.{nl}You may show it to Victoras and return.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005513	It can't be...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005514	{nl}Premier Eminent had evidence that proved Ruklys was to be suspected of treason.{nl}The fact that he enlisted in the army and built the Fortress of the Land, that is.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005515	{nl}But this document...{nl}It's an order of the king commanding the construction of the Fortress of the Land and the deployment of defense forces!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005516	{nl}Does this mean Ruklys followed the orders of the king, but was made to be a traitor for it?{nl}I can't imagine what King Kadumel and Premier Eminent's intentions could have been.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005517	{nl}All I did was follow orders, and yet I, too, ended with blood on my hands...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005518	{nl}Something needs to be settled, then.{nl}I must apologize to Hayatin.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005519	You may go to Hayatin.{nl}I will meet you there soon.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005520	Welcome, traveler.{nl}Did you come to tell new stories of your adventures?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005521	{nl}Do you mean you found a document that proves Ruklys was innocent?{nl}If you don't mind, would you let me have a look at it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005522	Hm... The contents of this document are surprising indeed.{nl}I will report this to the Wings of Vaivora immediately.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005523	{nl}If it is proven that Ruklys was accused of false charges, he will be named a hero once again.{nl}Your name, too, will be remembered for your great contribution to our history.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005524	{nl}Pyromancer Master Abreh will be glad to hear about this. She has always been interested in Ruklys.{nl}If I ever compile materials on him, I'll make sure to send her a copy.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005525	You must show this document to someone who can help spread the truth to the world.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005526	Many of my subordinates are still possessed by the monsters.{nl}Would you free them as well?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005527	I can still see some of their altered spirits.{nl}I'm sorry, but would you free some more?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005528	Many spirits are now free thanks to you.{nl}May I ask you for one more favor?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005529	Defeat the monsters surrounded by blue light and free the spirits they are possessing.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005530	Thank you.{nl}But it seems many of my subordinates are still possessed, unaware of who they are.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005531	I can only be grateful.{nl}All my soldiers look to have been freed now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005532	This is not good.{nl}If the monsters get out, who knows what terrible things they will do...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005533	After this region suddenly lost its balance, my personal research was pushed to the background.{nl}I just wish my colleagues would bring a talented assistant from one of the big cities.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005534	It was all our fault.{nl}That's why I want to make things right again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005535	No one thought a single Centaurus could change so much...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005536	We can't let the Centaurus be.{nl}We need to take measures.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005537	If it weren't for you, all the cities nearby would be in great danger.{nl}Thank you. I mean it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005538	I'm going to stay here and apply all measures necessary.{nl}I'll make sure the Moglans and Duckies stay within the region to maintain balance.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005539	Oh, just when I thought I was hopeless, a traveler appears!{nl}I'm so glad.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005540	{nl}Traveler, I need your help.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005541	{nl}Three different species of monsters live in this region: Duckies, Moglans and Beetows.{nl}Among those, the Duckies and the Moglans hunt and kill each other.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005542	{nl}If one species exterminates the other and goes beyond Khamadon Forest, it'll soon be out of control.{nl}So please, traveler, help me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005543	First...{nl}I should introduce myself.{nl}My name is Sophia.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005544	{nl}I've been researching with my colleagues ways to recover from the aftermaths of Medzio Diena.{nl}Recently we found a reaction in bracken that's different from other types of vegetation.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005545	{nl}Since then, we started to investigate different types of bracken.{nl}That's how we ended up in the depths of Khamadon Forest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005546	{nl}Like I said before, the Red Duckies and the Blue Moglans are at war with each other.{nl}Even though they're both dangerous species, this is the first time they venture to other regions.{nl}Them being rivals is what kept the balance of the region, you see.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005547	{nl}But recently that balance was lost.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005548	{nl}Red Duckies reproduce at a very fast rate.{nl}They're hunted by Ceuntaurus, however, so their population had been under control so far.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005549	{nl}The problem started when Centaurus fell in a deep sleep and the Ducky population started to increase.{nl}They started to outnumber the Moglans, going as far as to reach beyond Khamadon Forest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005550	{nl}My colleagues left for the big cities nearby to warn the people there and I stayed here alone.{nl}I beg you, traveler, help me stop the Red Duckies from multiplying.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005551	If we're going to stop the Duckies, first we need to find out as much as we can about them.{nl}The problem is my colleagues and I can't face them on our own.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005552	{nl}But you seem strong enough. Won't you defeat a few Red Duckies and bring them over?{nl}Meanwhile I'll collect the fragments for investigation.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005553	Thank you. I just need you to defeat a few Duckies.{nl}I'll follow after you and pick up the fragments.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005554	{nl}I sprayed some monster repellent on myself, so don't worry.{nl}I wish I had some more... I'm really sorry.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005555	I was able to collect a lot of samples.{nl}All thanks to you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005556	{nl}I'm going to study the samples and find a way to stop the Duckies.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005557	But we can't depend on a single method to control the Duckies.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005558	{nl}While I analyze the collected fragments, there's something I want to ask you.{nl}Can you help me a little more?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005559	Thank you.{nl}I want to test whether destroying their nests will have any impact in reducing the population.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005560	{nl}I'm going to give you a powerful solvent.{nl}Go to the deeper parts of the forest and use it to destroy the nests of Red Duckies.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005561	Use the solvent at the Duckies' habitat to destroy their nests.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005562	Good job.{nl}I also finished analyzing the fragments.{nl}But I'm afraid the results aren't exactly positive...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005563	I ran several tests, but besides confirming that the Duckies have very high vitality, there was nothing else I could find.{nl}Destroying their nests doesn't seem to have worked either.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005564	{nl}The more you destroy them, the more new ones appear.{nl}What can we do about this...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005565	That's a good idea!{nl}I think I know a way.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005566	{nl}We found a type of brown bracken growing in Gemyn Cliff and Loba Fields called Yega Bracken.{nl}Its spores have been shown to increase the abilities of animals in previous tests.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005567	{nl}It could very well have the same effect on Blue Moglans.{nl}I can prepare the refining process while you collect the Yega Bracken spores.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005568	All you need to do is gather the spores of any Yega Bracken you see.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005569	Good, good.{nl}I'm all set for the refining process too, I'll get started on the drug right away.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005570	So I've refined the spores, but I don't know if the quantities are right.{nl}We need to test the drug in a few different ratios to be sure.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005571	{nl}Once again, I'm going to need your help.{nl}Can I count on you?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005572	Thank you. First I will need you to weaken the Blue Moglans to about 1/3.{nl}Then, use this sleep powder on them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005573	{nl}Once the Moglans are asleep, test the drugs on them and check the results.{nl}They live in the region stretching from Virszutinis Stream to Apatynis Brook.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005574	The results were outstanding.{nl}Thanks to your help, we found the ideal mix ratio to make the Blue Moglans more powerful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005575	The strength enhancer for the Blue Moglans is ready.{nl}Supposedly Blue Moglans have a habit of gathering all their food in one place.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005576	{nl}We can use that to our advantage.{nl}We just need to mix in the drug with their food.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005577	Thank you.{nl}These are the refined spores that'll enhance the strength of the Blue Moglans.{nl}Just put this drug in the places where they gather their food.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005578	{nl}They keep the food deep within the areas of their habitat.{nl}You can search around Apatynis Brook.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005579	{nl}Meanwhile I'll keep looking for ways to weaken the Duckies.{nl}I'm really sorry to be asking all these favors to someone I just met, but thank you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005580	If we mix the refined spore drug with the Blue Moglans' food, they'll become stronger and help stop the Duckies.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005581	Good job.{nl}Now we wait for the results.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005582	The Moglans have definitely become stronger, but they're still outnumbered by the Duckies.{nl}Sigh... I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but I guess I have no choice.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005583	I have to confess something to you.{nl}Everything I'm doing right now is actually to correct a mistake my colleagues and I did...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005584	{nl}There's a reason the Centaurus is asleep.{nl}It was our fault. We didn't want it to interfere with the research so we lured it far away from here and drugged it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005585	{nl}But if the Duckies start spreading to the outside, we'll be in even deeper trouble.{nl}If we're going to try and stop it, we have no choice but to wake the Centaurus...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005586	{nl}I do have something in mind.{nl}Are you familiar with Astrus herbs?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005587	{nl}Burning these herbs releases a scent so strong people say it can wake up the dead.{nl}I think we can use these herbs to wake up the Centaurus.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005588	{nl}I'm really sorry for all the trouble, but this is the only way.{nl}Please go to Virszutinis Stream and gather the Astrus herbs that grow there.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005589	I'll try and gather as much I can myself.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005590	Thank you.{nl}If we add the amounts we gathered, we should have enough herbs to wake up the Centaurus.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005591	You'll find the Centaurus sleeping in Loba Fields.{nl}To wake it up, burn the Astrus herbs in five places around it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005592	Thank you so much.{nl}Just know that it could be dangerous. It's best to hide immediately after you burn all the herbs.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005593	Please burn the Astrus herbs around the sleeping Centaurus.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005594	I was waiting for you!{nl}The Centaurus went running to the region where the Duckies live.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005595	{nl}Luckily I heard it roar and was able to hide just in time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005596	{nl}It was acting a lot more vicious than I expected.{nl}Are you sure you used the Astrus herbs right?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005597	{nl}It's calling our for other Centaurus now.{nl}This could make matters a lot worse.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005598	Judging by how it went running to the Duckies, I'm sure their numbers are reduced by now.{nl}But the Centaurus is still not showing any signs of calming down...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005599	{nl}On top of that it's even calling Centaurus from other regions.{nl}This could have serious repercussions.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005600	{nl}I feel so sorry to you for all these mistakes.{nl}I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you for one last thing...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005601	{nl}Please understand that you're my only hope.{nl}Will you defeat the Centaurus?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005602	I really don't know how to thank you enough.{nl}The problem now is that I don't know how I'm going to deal with all the Red Duckies with the Centaurus gone.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005603	{nl}I remember the Centaurus had a special way to overpower the Red Duckies.{nl}It would shine a red light from the crystal on its head to knock them out.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005604	{nl}It's like they would be suddenly smitten by something.{nl}They can't recover from that state either...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005605	{nl}So I'm thinking; if you can get me the crystal from the Centaurus' head I could use it to control the Duckies.{nl}I think it went to Uplink Wall. I'm counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005606	Defeat the Centaurus in Uplink Wall.{nl}And please bring me its crystal.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005607	I'm relieved to see you're as powerful as I thought.{nl}I'm going to study the Centaurus crystal you brought and find a way to control the Duckies.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005608	I had thought the crystal on the Centaurus' head was a single mass, but it turned out to be made of condensed particles.{nl}So the thing smiting the Duckies wasn't light, but dust coming from the crystal.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005609	{nl}I'm going to grind part of the crystal into a powder.{nl}Take the powder and spread it around Centrynis Field, where the Duckies are concentrating.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005610	{nl}I want to make sure their entire habitat is affected though, so it's best if you mix the powder in with the dirt there.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005611	I'm so sorry I keep bothering you.{nl}But if this works I can keep controlling the Ducky population with Centaurus powder.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005612	Go to Centrynis Field and mix the powder in with the dirt there.{nl}I'll be counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005613	Very good.{nl}I just hope this time it works.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005614	Success!{nl}The number of new Red Ducky nests was reduced by a lot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005615	{nl}I've noted down the components of the crystal powder.{nl}I can't replicate it exactly, but I think I can work up something similar.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005616	{nl}But the materials...{nl}Would you do me another favor?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005617	{nl}I need dry bracken leaves and Blue Beetow wings.{nl}If you bring me those materials I can make sure the Ducky population is under control for a while.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005618	You can get the dry bracken leaves from Loba Fields.{nl}And don't forget the Blue Beetow wings.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005619	Thank you.{nl}I should get started on the Centaurus powder alternative now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005620	I feel so bad for all the trouble I put you through.{nl}We almost destroyed the natural balance of this region, my colleagues and I.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005621	{nl}In trying to stop the vegetation problem and save the people, we put everyone in even more danger.{nl}I don't even want to think what would've happened if you weren't here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005622	{nl}Still, offsetting the balance of the forest was my fault...{nl}From now on I'm only going to focus on maintaining Khamadon Forest the way it is.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005623	I have to thank you for all the help you've given me.{nl}I hope your path is blessed by the grace of the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005624	Hmm?{nl}I didn't realize civilians we allowed here...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005625	{nl}Although, if you came all the way here, you can't be just anyone, can you?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005626	{nl}My name's Ella.{nl}I'm here on behalf of Beikeol to collect records of the kingdom.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005627	{nl}Would you be able to help us?{nl}We're having a bit of trouble because of the Green Goblins...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005628	Taniel I Avenue was home to the royal library and the many bookshops that kept the ever-growing knowledge of the time.{nl}Of course, all of it was destroyed during Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005629	{nl}All the people with royal jobs who survived Medzio Diena are preparing for the restoration of the kingdom.{nl}Beikeol is one of those people.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005630	{nl}Beikeol is working to build a foundation for the kingdom by recovering old records lost during Medzio Diena.{nl}That is why my assistants and I are here collecting records.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005631	{nl}The problem is... I don't know.{nl}People are being pestered by monsters everywhere...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005632	{nl}And I realize how important these records are, but right now aren't there more important issues?{nl}I just feel like it's a waste of manpower sometimes.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005633	Recently we found some old parchment documents in the area.{nl}But for some reason the Green Goblins are also after those parchments.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005634	{nl}My assistants were able to hide them inside some pots nearby but...{nl}We're having trouble going back for them because of the Green Goblins.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005635	{nl}I was wondering if you could retrieve the parchments we hid in those pots.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005636	You'll see the pots where we hid the documents here and there.{nl}I simply need you to retrieve the documents and bring them over.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005637	Thank you.{nl}There really wasn't much we could do surrounded by Goblins like that.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005638	I counted all the parchments you brought but... it seems a lot of them are still missing.{nl}I assume the Goblins must have taken them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005639	{nl}So I was wondering...{nl}Would you defeat the Green Goblin Wizards and get back the parchments they took?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005640	I suspect the Green Goblins took the parchments and gave them to the Green Goblin Wizards to keep.{nl}I know it won't be easy, but please try and get the parchments from them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005641	Thank you.{nl}I think you've recovered all the parchments now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005642	I still can't help but think it's all very strange though.{nl}I wonder why the Green Goblins were so interested in those parchments.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005643	{nl}I mean, it's not like they can even read them...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005644	{nl}I think we should investigate the reason why they were after our documents.{nl}If anything, it could lead us to other lost parchments.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005645	{nl}First, I want to make fake parchments to trick them.{nl}I do need chemicals for that... some contaminated tree root sap should be a good alternative.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005646	Take this handknife.{nl}Use it to make cuts in the roots of contaminated trees and obtain their sap.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005647	{nl}Make cuts in the tree roots with the knife to collect their sap.{nl}The sap is highly toxic though, so don't carry it for too long.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005648	You weren't affected by the sap, were you?{nl}I knew you could do it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005649	With your help I finally have the fake parchments ready!{nl}It's time to go and test them on the Goblins.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005650	{nl}If we place the fakes somewhere the Goblins can easily see them, I'm guessing they'll take them.{nl}Then, we follow them and hopefully we'll find out why they're so interested in our documents.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005651	{nl}First, I was hoping you could set up the fake parchments for the Goblins to find.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005652	You can put the fake parchments in place after you defeat all the Goblins around.{nl}They may not be the brightest creatures, but we can't set up the fakes with them watching.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005653	{nl}After that, my assistants will be in charge of following them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005654	I have five locations in mind for this operation.{nl}First you'll need to clear out all the Goblins in each area.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005655	{nl}We can't let them see us plant the fake parchments.{nl}Alright, I'm counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005656	Well done.{nl}We should be receiving reports from the assistants who followed the Goblins any time now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005657	While we wait for the reports, may I ask you a favor?{nl}I don't feel safe with all these Goblins around.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005658	{nl}Not only do they take our parchments, but they always end up interfering with our investigations.{nl}Can I ask you to take care of any Goblins nearby?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005659	Thank you.{nl}You can get rid of any Green Goblins you see wandering around.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005660	Please take care of the Green Goblins wandering around here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005661	Thank you.{nl}I've just received the reports from the assistants who went out to follow the Goblins that took our fake parchments.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005662	According to them...{nl}The Goblins took the fake parchments to the roof of the library annex.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005663	{nl}The Goblins must be doing something there.{nl}We should investigate the roof of the annex.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005664	{nl}Although first we should stop any more documents from disappearing...{nl}If anything's causing them to disappear, I want you to take care of it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005665	{nl}And just let me know then.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005666	I can't help but have a bad feeling about this.{nl}You never know when something is going to jump out at us, so be very careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005667	There is definitely something happening at the roof of the library annex.{nl}Go there and investigate, but make sure you're prepared first.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005668	I never would have guessed there was a Basilisk threatening the Green Goblins...{nl}But I guess, with their main concern gone, they should leave the parchments alone now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005669	{nl}I really don't know how to thank you.{nl}I'll make sure to tell Beikeol all about you and your precious help.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005670	{nl}Also, this is from me personally.{nl}I'm trying to collect all the books I can get my hands on... so I end up with more than one copy  sometimes.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005671	{nl}This is a book about all past kings.{nl}It's an abridged version, and it was published before the 15th generation, so there's no information from the periods after that.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005672	{nl}Still, all the important historical facts are in it.{nl}If you're interested in the history of the kingdom, I suggest you give it a read.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005673	{nl}Alright then, I hope the the grace of the goddesses will follow you on your path.{nl}And if you meet any of my assistants, please help them in any way you can.

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005769	{nl}To this, Barconsi replied:{nl}[What you say is true, and I will not try to prove it. On the other hand, are you sure that finding something first grants you the rights to it? I can't seem to remember any such laws existing.

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005774	{nl}At that point, Baroconsi replied.{nl}[Huh? Are you trying to purchase our gold?]{nl}[What do you mean?]{nl}[Like I have said before, you don't listen, do you? You said you will tell me what you are going to do with the gold veins when you obtain them. Obtaining implies that you are not in possession of the object. Am I right?]
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005775	{nl}What he has just heard turned his stomach around once more{nl}but decided to endure it and asked again.{nl}[These gold veins shall be used to build the walls around the capital of the Kingdom.]{nl}[Ah that plan of Taniel a human king.]
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005776	{nl}[You are correct. We will use the gold from these veins{nl}as our fund and start a business of selling supplies and building materials to the Kingdom and make profit from the practice.]{nl}[If that is your purpose, I can never let you have them.]

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005778	{nl}Once Baroconsi heard this. he replied.{nl}[Since you are so confident, it wouldn't matter if I choose the game right? Since you are good at everything.]{nl}[It doesn't bother me.{nl}Let's start already.]
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005779	{nl}[Okay. Let's. As for the game,{nl}how about we ask each other questions about the veins. A true owner of these veins must be able to answer without any hesitation, right?]
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005780	{nl}Rumpelstiltskin thought about the proposal for a moment.{nl}The opponent is a human who have just discovered them. There was no way a powerful demon like him{nl}could ever be beaten by an ordinary human. He accepted the proposal.{nl}[Alright. I like it. Go on.]
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005781	{nl}Once Rumpelstiltskin accepted the idea, a further discussion on some ground rules and details went on and finally they reached an agreement. One of the terms was one could ask three questions to the other. Baroconsi started his question.{nl}[How many carriages would be needed to transport all of the gold in these veins?]
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005782	{nl}A powerful demon like Rumpelstiltskin{nl}could not even begin to fathom the answer even if he had clairvoyance, he wouldn't be able to answer it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005783	{nl}He thought about it but after a while, he figure{nl}even Baroconsi would not answer this question so he gave up. His reasoning was{nl}if Baroconsi doesn't know the answer as well, the round is a draw.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005784	{nl}But as soon as Rumpelstiltskin gave up, Baroconsi answered{nl}[One carriage as big as these veins would certainly carry all the gold. So the answer is one.]
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005785	{nl}This, of course, infuriated Rumpelstiltskin and protested that that was not fair.{nl}Baroconsi did not even flinch and silently started at the giant demon who can easily squahs him with a tip of his finger.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005786	{nl}Rumpelstiltskin eventually calmed down a bit. It was not in his nature to stop a game once it started. Furthermore, he took great pleasure from defeating his opponent no matter the circumstances or conditions. So he continued.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005787	{nl}Baroconsi asked another question{nl}[My second question is this. You and I guess the amount of gold these veins would produce in a year and the one to guess the closest wins this round.]
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005788	{nl}At the question, Rumpelstiltskin added.{nl}[This time no trick with the scales. I will not tolerate such cheap trick anymore. And if you still do, I win.]
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005789	{nl}Baroconsi stared at Rumpelstiltskin straight in the eyes.{nl}Showing no sign of fear. {nl}Even when standing before a demon with infernal flame coming out of his head and razor sharp teeth gleaming with cruelty.{nl}[I give you my word on it. No scale trick this time.]
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005790	{nl}[I wil go first this time.{nl}By human technology, the amount of gold that can be mined from these veins will be the same as the amount of 17,200 people can carry. With a margin of error of 3 people. If you say a number close to what I have just said and claim that your number is closer. I will take that as a forefeit.]
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005791	{nl}Baroconsi replied.{nl}[I am not quite sure how that would make it a win for you but it's irrelevant for I have a different number. My number is 0.]{nl}[What?]
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005792	{nl}[0. Nil. Nada. To be more precise,{nl}for next year, the veins will not yield any gold. 0 of any scale is still 0.]{nl}[That only applies if you are in charge. If I am the master, I can simply make that answer incorrect by taking a small chunk right now!]{nl}[Be my guest, if you can.]{nl}[What makes you think I can't?]
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005793	{nl}[Well, you have a habit of not listening to other people.{nl}I have already told you that the Kedoran Merchant Alliance has the ownership of these gold veins{nl}and the Alliance always back its claim with evidences.

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005794	{nl}We have set up a barrier that no demon can ever cross{nl}The barrier will last for a year from now.{nl}That means you cannot ever touch the gold here.{nl}These facts make my guess not a guess but an accurate answer.]
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005795	{nl}[I will not have it. The second question is null.{nl}Or at least a draw.]{nl}Baroconsi did not argued with the demon's claim at all and continued.{nl}[Alright, the round is a draw.

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005796	{nl}Rumpelstiltskin was puzzled by his calm acceptance.{nl}But he did get what he wanted and it was his turn to ask. so his mind quickly became occupied with making a question. He thought about it for a moment and asked{nl}[Who will be the owner of these gold veins in one year?] 
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005797	{nl}The question was immediately followed by a stern warning from Rumpelstiltskin.{nl}[If you say the Kedoran Merchant Alliance or any other person or entity, I will devour every single one of you. Of course, such task could not be done instantly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005798	{nl}but a year worth of time is enough. Enough to end you{nl}or any other fool who dares to claim the ownership. That fear would spread and the fools will stop. Besides, the barrier you claimed to have put will be over by then. No matter what the circumstance is the answer is absolute and only one. Isn't it?]
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005799	{nl}Rumpelstiltskin glowing with a sense of victory looked at{nl} Baroconsi. The countenance of Baroconsi did not alter at all. As if to show he has been expecting the demon's answer all along simply answered.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005800	{nl}[The owner of the gold veins in one year's time would be you,{nl}Rumpelstiltskin.] Rumpelstiltskin was somewhat troubled by lack of disappoinment in Baroconsi's face but was joyous and said.{nl}[Yes, you admitted yourself.

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005801	{nl}[Not necessarily.]{nl}[What do you mean?]{nl}[I win two rounds and one was a draw. The score is 2 to nil. We won the game and we are the owner of this place.]
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005802	{nl}The demon countered. {nl}[Even if that is true, you've said it yourself, I will be the master in one year. That means, the gold veins become mine.{nl}And furthermore, you are bound by your own words that you will not be able to mine any gold from here. That means, I de facto own them.]

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005826	Oversight...{nl}Didn't expect a surprise attack from behind.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005827	Who could have done this?{nl}Could it be a demon or someone with other intents?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005828	A traveler to a place like this? Now that's a rare occasion.{nl}My name is Jaunius.{nl}I belong to a newly-formed small order to uphold the will of the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005829	{nl}I came to this place when I heard that the refugees are in danger.{nl}I suspect the evil energy of this place.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005830	{nl}It is the will of the goddess to wipe out the monsters and help the refugees.{nl}How about joining our order?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005831	Good.{nl}Now, help me a bit.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005832	We will talk more about joining our order after we take care of the evil energy here.{nl}The monsters here are not only pestering the refugees but hinder my research on the evil energy.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005833	{nl}A clean up might be in order.{nl}Please, wipe out a horde of pags.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005834	I am counting on you.{nl}Having them out will greatly help the purification process.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005835	You've came back.{nl}Good work.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005836	Hm... you saw a ghost after cleaning up the monsters?{nl}I believe they are those who have perished by the monsters...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005837	Poor souls.{nl}We need to stop this atrocity as quickly as possible.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005838	Even with your help, oncoming hordes of monsters continue.{nl}They need to be wiped out so that we can purify and set up a new base of our order.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005839	A different approach might be in order.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005840	{nl}Inside the Room of Consciousness, there is our altar.{nl}We've built it to worship Goddess. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005841	With the power of the altar, we can drive out those monsters.{nl}But it still lack the divine energy yet.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005842	{nl}Could you defeat monsters and retrieve their cores? They can be used to charge up the altar.{nl}Pam Clamper's core might be ideal.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005843	Well, there might be some relevance.{nl}Offer Pag Clamper cores, the divine energy of the altar will charge up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005844	Please, bring pag clamper cores from pag clampers.{nl}Again, thank you for your service.

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005846	Ah...{nl}Welcome back, but...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005847	It seems it's not enough.{nl}It's for the best to do it once and do it right. Further preparation is in order.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005848	There is a coffin in the Hunne Memorial Room.{nl}Inside it, there are some objects. Could you get them?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005849	Well... they are...{nl}Souls of the followers will add the divine energy to the altar.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005850	So please, retrieve the keepsakes inside the coffin.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005851	With this mission, we can definitely drive out the monsters away with the power of the altar.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005852	Hmm...well done.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005853	All set.{nl}It's all going smoothly.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005854	Now, go to the altar and let's test it out.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005855	Failed again...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005856	Huh? Were are there?{nl}Never mind what just happened.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005857	Well, I did notify other followers about you and how you wish to join us.{nl}I have some unfinished business to resolve. I believe you are needed at Tymeris Sanctuary.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005858	{nl}A beliver called Costas will be waiting for you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005859	Costas
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005860	You must be the one whom Jaonus has been talking about.{nl}I am Costas.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005861	{nl}Just a couple of things you need to do and then you are welcome to join us.{nl}Firstly, we need to gather the scattered Doctrine chapters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005862	{nl}Doctrine has been scattered when the monsters attacked.{nl}As you know, the recent upsurge in monsters...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005863	Then, godspeed.{nl}This won't be too difficult.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005864	I want to help you on the quest but I have urgent business to take care of....{nl}Just retrieve non-damaged ones, please.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005865	They are scattered around.{nl}Some might have been torn up by monsters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005866	You've found all the important sections of Doctrine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005867	{nl}Ah, this one is far too damaged. There is no need for it.{nl}Thank you for you hard work.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005868	All we need to do now is,{nl}light up a campfires that detects and purify the evil energy at in Nagyt Stone Room.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005869	{nl}We set up the place, so all that is left is oil to keep the holy fire burning.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005870	{nl}As for the oil, Blue Pag Dopers near the room.{nl}Please, gather the oil from them and light the campfires.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005871	There aren't that many of the campfires so securing the oil is the main task.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005872	I need to finish up inscribing on the wall...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005873	Thank you so much.{nl}Now, you are part of the order!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005874	There is an order that worships Goddess at Tymeris Temple?{nl}Never heard of them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005875	{nl}That so-called Doctrine is... blasphemous.{nl}All those heretics, ever since the disappearance of Goddess.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005876	{nl}Take that Doctrine to Judge Rymis in Fedimian suburbs.{nl}He will know something about this "order."
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005877	Welcome, what brought you to this place, my child?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005878	{nl}Ah..{nl}The Priest Master sent you to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005879	Based on what I have read from that Doctrine. It is certainly not orthodox.{nl}Please, make haste and consult with Rymis.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005880	{nl}Rymis is in Fedimian Suburbs.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005881	The writings are partially unintelligible but what I can make out are phrases like Giltine...Death....Praise.{nl}They certainly are not normal order that worship Goddess. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005882	Welcome back.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005883	Book of Judgement, when seen, running away is the usual response.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005884	Well done.{nl}Failure would certainly slow them down.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005885	On that day,  the Order of the Tree of Truth problem will be solved and I will deal with this myself.{nl}Thank you for your service.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005886	My friends all seem to have fallen asleep, no one is responding...{nl}It wasn't a monster attack, was it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005887	A suspicious group of heretics in Tymeris Temple...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005888	{nl}So, this is their Doctrine, eh?{nl}Heavily damaged but some parts are intelligible.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005889	{nl}I did hear there was a group that broke away from the Order of the Tree of Truth.{nl}They were said to be too radical even for the Order of the Tree of Truth. When I said they 'broke away' it was more like 'they were casted out'
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005890	{nl}They are trying to set up a headquarter that.{nl}But I cannot leave this place because of the whole Order of the Tree of Truth business...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005891	Please, reform those heretics.{nl}Take this book with you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005892	They are fairly new. There won't be that many people.{nl}The book reacts to the heretics that refuse to be reformed. It will guide you in your task.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005893	May Goddess watch over your path.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005894	Doctrine is far too damaged.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005895	Something is covering the page, rendering it unreadable.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005896	The ink is smudged.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005897	Something written on the wall.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005898	What are these souls?{nl}What happened, here?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005899	What chaos...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005900	{nl}Oh hello.{nl}My name is Hilda.{nl}I somehow survived and came to be here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005901	{nl}Could...could you help us?{nl}There are two cupoles, not a day go by without their constant bickering with each other.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005902	{nl}There is nothing we could to about it and we are looking for someone to help us on this.{nl}Could you either make them be friends with each other or resolve the conflict?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005903	You would do that for us? Oh thank you so much.{nl}The cupoles can be see at Dvynai Hills.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005904	I trust you would do a great job.{nl}We don't know what they would do and when.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005905	A traveler to this place? That is something rare.{nl}I am Lina.{nl}I am in charge of leading souls.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005906	{nl}Ever since Medzio Diena, the autumn leaves are not as they seem.{nl}Usually, the autumn leaves represent hope of new leaves and the well-deserved rest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005907	{nl}However, these autumn leaves have stopped growing and went into eternal dying.{nl}I have been searching for a way to bring life back to those trees.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005908	{nl}This, I believe, is for the best.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005909	I am in charge of providing trees with supplements.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005910	{nl}Why am I not using the Kupole power? I alone cannot
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005911	{nl}Thank you for volunteering to help us.{nl}To get what we need to craft, obtaining Nutta Fluid from Nuttafly and Nuttabug would be in order.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005912	The forest is far too big for me to do it alone.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005913	That was quite quick.{nl}Thank you so much for your service.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005914	That seems to be sufficient.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005915	Now, could you gather up the leaves that will be used as main ingredients for making the supplement?{nl}The piles of leaves can be easily found at Netting Hills.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005916	Those leaves combined with the fluid you've brought can be mixed and make the supplement.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005917	Please, be safe.{nl}I will prepare the rest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005918	Making the supplements is not hard, at least I have gotten used to it but gathering materials on the other hand.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005919	That seems to be enough leaves.{nl}Please, wait a moment.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005920	I will mix the leaves with the processed materials to make the supplements.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005921	The supplements are all ready.{nl}Could you get these to Popot Stream?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005922	There, you will find a bottle that I have set up.{nl}Just fill it in with the supplement.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005923	I will await for your triumphant return.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005924	A traveler? What business would you have with me?{nl}Why I broke the bottle?{nl}Well these should not be here!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005925	{nl}I don't know why Lina keeps trying to reverse the path of nature?{nl}The leaves keep the plants down. Reviving them will unleash the plants.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005926	{nl}Who is going to deal with that, eh?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005927	You think so too, right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005928	I just don't understand.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005929	Just for a moment, I was away. She creates more mess.{nl}What am I going to do with her.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005930	So you've met Aeglei?{nl}Did he break the bottles again, I presume.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005931	{nl}Aeglei says that I will unleash the plant outbreak but if we leave it alone, it won't be just leaves.{nl}Every single plant life will fall as if it is in the middle of particularly harsh Winter.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005932	{nl}I must protest Aeglei's thoughtless action.{nl}I just don't understand.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005933	{nl}But thanks anyway.{nl}If you don't want to be involved with the whole Aeglei and I situation, you can stop helping me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005934	You came back?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005935	You want to help me?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005936	What are you really up to?{nl}I don't need your help.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005937	I saw you helping Lina, why don't you go back to her?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005938	You're still here?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005939	Alright, if ya really wanna help, drive away nearby monsters.{nl}They pester me while I am fixing the mess left by Lina.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005940	If you can't, go back to Lina.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005941	I got my hands full fixing her mess.{nl}But if not me, who will?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005942	What? You really drove them off?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005943	You are serious, aren't you?{nl}If that is the case, let me ask you a favor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005944	{nl}Lina has messed around with this place quite a bit and I cannot do it alone.{nl}Please, check up on Bethez and Tjibes Refuges and see if any more of Lina's business is there.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005945	She sent you here that must mean she did something here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005946	When will I ever stop cleaning up after her.{nl}So frustrating.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005947	Ah welcome back.{nl}Hmm... nothing suspicious was found, eh.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005948	Well, thank you for checking up on them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005949	Ah, this is a communication device to communicate with other kupoles while out staying here tending the forest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005950	Jaonus disappeared without any answer.{nl}Let's go to the Consciousness Room, he talked about.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005951	This supplement bottle is full.{nl}Let's find another one.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005952	Aeglei and Lina still constantly bicker with each other but neither the autumn leaves nor plant outbreaks are happening anywhere.{nl}As if the forest has found an equilibrium.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005953	There is no sign of Lina's devices.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005954	I thought regularly injecting the trees with supplements will revive the dying autumn leaves.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005955	In the name of Thomas Iquinostasys, the day of judgement upon all the heretic will come.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005956	The forest is dying.{nl}The autumn leaves are the proofs.{nl}We must save the trees.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005957	I cannot thank you enough.{nl}Thanks to you, we have found a way to keep the forest's equilibrium.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005958	I will maintain it along with Aeglei and keep the townspeople away from harm.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005959	You feel strange.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005960	Ha...I just cannot understand Lina.{nl}Plant outbreaks will put all of the townspeople in danger.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005961	Her heart is in the right place, I admit but she doesn't have any foresight.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005962	A travel, I see.{nl}Welcome.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005963	I am Brunonas a forest keeper.{nl}I came here to help Chronomancer Ida on investigating the autumn leaves phenomenon in this area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005964	I mean, my life as a forest keeper made me curious also.{nl}So I asked the woodsmen and herbalists nearby to help our investigation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005965	From what I know, the whole thing started after Medzio Diena.{nl}Ida thinks it goes further than that.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005966	{nl}I don't know why she would think like that.{nl}If you are so keen to find out, how about helping me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005967	Good to hear.{nl}I am a mission from Ida to check up on Raffye Crossroads among other things.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005968	While I take care of the other tasks, could you go and check up on Raffye Crossroads for me?{nl}You might have to defend yourself on your way there from the monster, though.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005969	Come back to me, after you check it out.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005970	You came back.{nl}Did the monsters give you any trouble?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005971	Ah yes.{nl}The autumn leaves themselves display nothing unusual.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005972	{nl}The same goes for the ones I have search as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005973	If possible, could I ask you one more favor?{nl}You might have seen some patches of moss on Raffye Trail.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005974	They are hidden behind the rocks, I presume.{nl}Could you grab some samples for me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005975	Thanks.{nl}Now, I need to write down what I have found here for Ida.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005976	{nl}Ida asked for the findings in a report form.{nl}If I can just determine the type of moss, I can send this in right away. So, could you please gather some moss samples?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005977	I will be finishing up my report.{nl}Thank you for doing this for me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005978	Ah, you've came back.{nl}Let me see.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005979	{nl}Hmm, these are Blue Nheto Moss. The kind only grows in autumn.{nl}Just as I thought.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005980	{nl}Then, here is the report Ida asked me to write.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005981	{nl}On your way to Ida, could you retrieve the reports from the aforementioned woodsman and herbalist?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005982	{nl}Ida will tell you about a thing or two regarding the cause, when she get these reports.{nl}After that, could you bring them back to me as well?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005983	Brunonas told me to go?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005984	{nl}As you heard, I am doing what Brunonas asked me to do.{nl}That is also Ida's request.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005985	{nl}As for me, I cannot refuse such request.{nl}My livelihood is in jeopardy with this prolonged autumn, after all.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005986	{nl}I just need a couple more of herbs.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005987	You will help me?{nl}Now, that's really good news.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005988	The tricky ones, I will handle them. So, all you have to do is get some yellow Lyciu Herbrs at Pjama Resting Place.{nl}Just finding something yellow in middle of red would not be that difficult.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005989	Lyciu Herbs.{nl}Their yellow color do make them stand out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005990	LI wish you all the good luck.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005991	You've got them alright.{nl}That seems to be enough.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005992	Now, just one for thing and we are done here.{nl}I would have to finish up my report so could you get them for me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005993	For naked human eyes, they are hard to find. But with the help of Iyran.{nl}It's not too bad.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005994	Vhelis is a root of some sort. Not leavess, nor flowers. Roots.{nl}It has a distinctive scent but undetectable by humans.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005995	{nl}Let Iyran works its magic.{nl}If he doesn't follow you, use this whistle. This'll bring call him.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005996	Iyran is smart and he will let you know straight away.{nl}And you can call it straight away via the whistle.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005997	Iyran is a smart boy, isn't he?{nl}Of course, he is. Look at the amount he got.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005998	Now. Let me just finish the report.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_005999	Here you go. All done.{nl}like Brunonas said go to the woodsmans and he will give you the other report.{nl}Godspeed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006000	Ah, you are here for the report, aren't you?{nl}I did hear it from Brunonas but...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006001	Recently, chopping down the trees have been booming. And I cannot keep up the demand.{nl}That slowed me down a bit.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006002	If the matter is that urgent, could you help me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006003	Well, with you on my team, I feel relieved.{nl}Go to the Kunck Logging Area and you will find the piles of woods I have made.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006004	{nl}Just check up on them, would ya?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006005	Just make sure the piles of firewood are okay.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006006	Ah, well come back.{nl}Huh? Strange powder?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006007	{nl}Those are from me. mushroom spores.{nl}The dry atmosphere dried them up quickly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006008	{nl}It certainly is a good day to chop woods.{nl}Not so much for growing mushrooms though.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006009	I will be finishing up my report for Ida.{nl}So, could you do the check up for me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006010	Lately, there have been some strange incidents, though.{nl}Like trees with strange rings. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006011	On Yvass Hill, please check the rings of trees.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006012	Just have a glance at them would be enough.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006013	I have been a lumberjack for quite a long time.{nl}I will put it in my report.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006014	How were the tree rings?{nl}As I expected, none at the outer region right?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006015	{nl}Just as I thought.{nl}Now, take this report.{nl}Along with the other report, take them to Ida.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006016	You have already checked this pile.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006017	What do I owe the pleasure?{nl}Ah, the reports from Cesaris, Dowedas and Brunonas/{nl}Thanks for all your trouble.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006018	{nl}I am Ida an apprentice to the Chronomancer Master.{nl}The Master has requested me to investigate the autumn leave anomaly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006019	{nl}I have already asked the nearby native workers here.{nl}The refuges are not all that familiar with the anomaly after all.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006020	{nl}Hmmm like what the master has expected.{nl}If possible, could you help me on a couple of experiments?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006021	Firstly, could you retrieve some blood samples from the monster?{nl}I need to test my master's theory.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006022	Then, I will leave the blood samples up to you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006023	That was rather fast.{nl}Now, show me the blood samples.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006024	That is more than enough for the experiment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006025	The blood is not going through clotting. As I have expected.{nl}Under normal circumstances, they should have been clotted quickly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006026	{nl}The master said that Medzio Diena is not the sole cause of the autumn leave anomaly.{nl}The axis of time itself is broken.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006027	{nl}Only one last thing to check.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006028	Take this bloom sample and go to a place outside the autumn leaves forest.{nl}If it gets clotted, then verification is complete.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006029	{nl}Could you take this sample at get to Outer Wall District 8?{nl}That is the nearest exit after all.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006030	How did the blood samples react?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006031	Just as we expected.{nl}The master was right.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006032	{nl}This proves that the time itself is broken and this place is frozen at autumn. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006033	{nl}The flow of time is broken and autumn continues.{nl}In other areas, the plant growths have experienced anomalies on their own.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006034	{nl}That means that Medzio Diena did not only affect the plant growths but also the flow of time itself.{nl}As a proof, the autumn leaves persist in this area.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006035	{nl}I should finish up the report.{nl}One last favor to ask of you. Could you give the report to my master?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006036	Thank you so much.{nl}I have some more tasks left for me here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006037	Just let my master know of the report.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006038	The report will do the talking.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006039	Ah, what seems to be the matter?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006040	You came in Ida's stead?{nl}So the results, how were they?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006041	Just as I expected. Medzio Diena is not the direct cause after all.{nl}The passage of time in that specific region is experiencing a some sort of freezing.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006042	{nl}Medzio Diena not only caused the overgrowth of the plants but also the time itself.{nl}The problem is limited to that specific area though.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006043	What did Ida think of all this?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006044	Ah, she as well?{nl}The time of autumn is frozen.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006045	I hope the Chronomancer Master and Ida sort this whole thing out.{nl}Autumn is killing the forest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006046	Thank you for letting me know.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006047	Monsters using the divine energy... I cannot begin to understand but I am to do as told.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006048	Ah, a traveler I see.{nl}My name is Morkus.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006049	{nl}I represent all the good people who have settled down here after Medzio Diena.{nl}What worries me is that the soldiers with whom we have been together so far have disappeared. And we are currently investigating their whereabouts.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006050	{nl}The soldiers are the family of the refuges.{nl}Even my brother is one of them. Fortunately, the journal he left is the clue at the moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006051	{nl}I came here cause I heard the soldiers were stationed here.{nl}The journal contains some clues but it is difficult for me to move about.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006052	Thank you for doing this for us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006053	{nl}We are about to despair because we did not have any help.{nl}Some are even on the brink of madness. Worried sick about their friends and families' whereabouts.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006054	Head Villager Morkus
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006055	Then, let's look at the jounral for clues.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006056	Where did all the soldiers go?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006057	How can I even begin to relay the news to the villagers?!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006058	One of the early entries say this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006059	This is madness. Autumn leaves don't grow back even if you paint them green.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006060	It seems that they were trying to make the leaves green again by painting them.{nl}I will give you the organic solvent to verify this. Could you check them for me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006061	{nl}If only, the leaves regain their true color...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006062	If the journal is accurate, something happened to the soldiers during the mission.{nl}If painting the leaves green is indeed true.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006063	I will pray for you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006064	Whatever happened to the soldiers?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006065	The leaves were indeed painted green!{nl}That verifies the conent of the journal.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006066	According to the jounral's other entries, it talks of a tree with all the leaves fallen out.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006067	Now, they are stitching the leaves back on the tree.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006068	Going insane... or perhaps already have.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006069	The state of soldiers is exacerbating.{nl}Cursed or affected by something?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006070	Please, let me know if the claim is true.{nl}If you come across a strange looking tree. Give it a shake...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006071	{nl}Now, the leaves didn't flutter, eh? The journal must be telling the truth.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006072	The soldiers must have been in a terrible situation.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006073	I pray they are safe.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006074	The leaves stayed on?{nl}As if they were sewn?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006075	{nl}The contents of the journal are true...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006076	{nl}The soldiers have become irreparably strange.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006077	There is no way of knowing now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006078	It's getting worse. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006079	Not just sewing the leaves but making a ragdoll and ripping them apart? That is not normal by any standard.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006080	What if the people get harmed?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006081	The last entry on the journal.{nl}I have searched the vicinity but have not found the ragdoll it speak of.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006082	That must be the last trace...{nl}Could other traces be erased by the monsters?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006083	The nearby monsters might have something on them. Could you check them out?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006084	I cannot do it myself due to the injury.{nl}I am truly sorry but could you check them out for me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006085	If the traces were not erased by the monsters that means we don't have any leads.{nl}Where to start.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006086	That ragdoll!{nl}Did you get it from the monster?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006087	Thank you so much for your hard work.{nl}Based on the journal, the soldiers were slowly going mad.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006088	What happened to them...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006089	Ah, I did find a necklace while searching.{nl}The soldiers did say there was a mysterious man. Perhaps it belongs to him.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006090	{nl}Evne a small clue is a big help. {nl}I will tell the others what we found here. Could you look for that mysterious man?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006091	Thank you.{nl}Here is the necklace.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006092	I hope, this time, we get to find out what happened to those soldiers.{nl}Not knowing what happened to one's own family is devastating.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006093	{nl}I will go to the soldiers' base camp and find something else.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006094	{nl}Even with my injury, it is not that far off. I can reach it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006095	I haven't seen you around here before.{nl}What can I do for you?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006096	You've got my necklace!{nl}That thing will call out monsters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006097	You must have been through a lot to get here.{nl}I offer my sinceresy apology.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006098	I was actually looking for it myself.{nl}But how did you know it belong to me in the first place?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006099	Ah, you've met the representative.{nl}You must be searching for what happened to the soldiers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006100	Hm..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006101	They are not just done.{nl}In fact, I lead them to somewhere else.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006102	The minds and bodies of those soldiers were broken.{nl}In their conditions, the forest's anomaly would have only caused further problems for them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006103	I could not risk infecting other villagers nor allowing something horrible happening to them by the soldiers.{nl}I had no choice but to lead them to a different place.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006104	{nl}It is better than risking everyone...{nl}I am truly sorry but I cannot tell you where they are for now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006105	I am fully aware of the fact that some of the soldiers are from the families of the refuges but...{nl}I did what I had to do.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006106	I take the full responsibilities and resentments from the refuges. Even their curses.{nl}If you want to know the whereabouts of the soldiers. Please, deliver this fact to them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006107	Even though, it had to be done. The guilt, I still feel.{nl}I am a human being. I do know the pain of losing a family.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006108	The soldiers have already gone mad...?{nl}And the man took them to somewhere else?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006109	{nl}... do you expect me to deliver such news to the village?{nl}To those who could not eat or sleep because they are worried sick about their families?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006110	Please, let the others know.{nl}I am sorry for giving you such a burden.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006111	Th-thank you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006112	I followed my mummy and daddy here.{nl}But I cannot find my daddy so I came out looking for him.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006113	My dad is a soldier. He didn't return home one day.{nl}A man said if I make thousand leaf whistles, Goddess Zemyna will grant my wish.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006114	So, I got out to make leaf whistles.{nl}But once I came here the monsters scared me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006115	{nl}Umm... could you help me make a whistle?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006116	Please, I need plant roots for my whistles.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006117	I did bring a shovel with me but the roots are far too sturdy for me do get them.{nl}I have heard the paringhetti resting place has a lot of them underground.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006118	Again, thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006119	Thank you so much.{nl}These seem to be more than enough!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006120	My daddy will return when I offer thousand leaf whistles I make, right?{nl}The man said so.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006121	When will daddy come home.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006122	It's better than nothing. Let's hold on to this damaged Doctrine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006123	When will we be able to complete the altar and worship the glory.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006124	A traveler?{nl}It's too dangerous here. I urge you to leave.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006125	I knew you are no ordinary one.{nl}If you are truly the savior, please, help me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006126	{nl}Recently, strong-looking demons have emerged around here.{nl}Perhaps they came here looking for the thing like I am.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006127	{nl}The thing I am looking for is in fact, the trace of Goddess.{nl}I am looking for the traces left by Goddess Ausrine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006128	{nl}We need to find the traces before the demons do.{nl}If we ever want to know the whereabouts of Goddess Ausrine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006129	We need to be absolutely sure if what the demons are doing is related to Goddess.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006130	{nl}I have seen a demon ordering his subordinates a while back. An elder demon, I presume.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006131	{nl}There must be written orders or documents regarding the order.{nl}Could you check if the demons might have something of that kind?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006132	You probably won't be able to read the demon language.{nl}If you find them, just bring them back to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006133	I will decipher them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006134	Of course, there was an written order.{nl}I will read it through.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006135	Stone fragments are here. Now to make a detector orb, the demon energy is required.{nl}You seem surprised.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006136	{nl}I can put my divine energy and find the objects related to Goddess.{nl}But we need the demon energy to activate the orb in the first place.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006137	{nl}I am the only one here so, my divine energy is not enough to power them both. That is why we need the demon energy.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006138	I will make the detector orb.{nl}Defeat monsters while carrying this will absorb the demon energy.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006139	The crystal will glow when it's full.{nl}I will pray for your safe and triumph return.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006140	Ah, well done.{nl}This will be enough to activate the orb.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006141	Now, let me thoroughly look at the written orders you have secrued.{nl}While I examine this, there are things I want you to get for me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006142	{nl}I am more than convinced that Ausrine's traces are the same thing as the demons are seeking.{nl}That is why I will make a detector orb that can sense the faint energy Ausrine left behind.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006143	{nl}Please, get me those materials.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006144	Jeromel Square is the place blessed by the goddess.{nl}That is why even a stone fragment is blessed with the power of the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006145	{nl}They are easy to acquire so perfect for our use.{nl}Please, get them for me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006146	Just look around the goddess statue in Jeromal Square.{nl}I will be reading through the orders while you do that.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006147	{nl}With you helping me, it is going so smoothly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006148	Well done.{nl}These will be enough.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006149	Thank you so much for retrieving them!
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006150	You've found a new order?{nl}Let me have a look.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006151	I think it's only a bit different from the previous one.{nl}It says that it should be retrieved from Diena instead of Demon Queen Gesti.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006152	Ah, that must be that demon I saw. Diena.{nl}Hmm, Diena...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006153	A Demon King, not a Demon Lord. Hmmm...
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006154	I have just finished reading through them.{nl}Just as I thought, they are searching for the traces of Goddess Ausrine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006155	{nl}And... the one who ordered is Gesti, the Demon Queen.{nl}It is no surprise since from the demon perspective, such is quite important.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006156	{nl}it says if any of them find something resembling a trace, bring it straight to Gesti.{nl}Three places are mentioned on the orders. Let's start with the nearest one.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006157	Park Residential Area is the closest among the three places.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006158	I will be inspecting the movment of the demons at different place.{nl}Use the divine energy detector orb near the Park Residential Area.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006159	Please, get to Jeromel Park Residential Area and please hurry.{nl}We must find the trace of Goddess Ausrine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006160	What you have retrieved is indeed the trace of Ausrine.{nl}That is why the demons attacked.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006161	{nl}Now, let's see.{nl}At first glance, it looks like a part of a device. I will hold on to it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006162	{nl}No time to waste.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006163	I have seen the demons rushing to Jeromel Park Management Office.{nl}Could you get there as soon as possible?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006164	We know they are after the traces of Ausrine.{nl}We must now find out why.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006165	{nl}If we beat them to the punch. We will know why as well.{nl}Also, we will get a glimpse of why Ausrine did what and why.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006166	I am really sorry to rush you.{nl}But we must find the trace before the demons do.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006167	Ah, this time the demons got their hands on it first.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006168	{nl}It is quite disappointing but there is no point crying over split milk. Then we must get the other one.{nl}We must hurry.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006169	The only place left is Shopping Street Entrance.{nl}Please, inspect the Shopping street.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006170	They also have lost one so the fight won't be easy.{nl}So be very careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006171	Please, be safe.{nl}I am very grateful for your help. It really sped things up.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006172	{nl}We will soon find the whereabouts of Goddess Ausrine as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006173	Prepare for the strong demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006174	I have inspected the traces you have found.{nl}Not counting the one taken by the demon, of course.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006175	{nl}They are parts of a device that is designed to control some sort of energy.{nl}We need to find more traces to be sure.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006176	{nl}The divine energy detector orb has ran out of its juice. It needs recharging.{nl}Just like what you did when we were making it. Fill it up with the demon energy.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006177	Deadborn you've just defeated must have exuded the magic around it when it died.{nl}I am pretty sure the spell is still there.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006178	{nl}It's much faster this way.{nl}I will keep an eye on the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006179	The next stop, Jonael Memorial.{nl}Let's get prepared and get to it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006180	You've came back rather quickly.{nl}It seems that this time it will last longer.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006181	The outbreak of plants at Jonael Memorial was rather severe than most places.{nl}On top of that, the demons will not take this lying down. They will attack with full force.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006182	I will be waiting for you there.{nl}As soon as you are ready, please, follow me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006183	You've came.{nl}Let's find the trace quick.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006184	By the time I got here, the demons were heading towards Jonael Memorial.{nl}That's where we need to go.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006185	{nl}The path leading there will be infested with the demons.{nl}Be safe and defeat them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006186	Defeating the monsters along the way would be wise.{nl}Now, please head towards Jonael Memorial.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006187	Clearing the path to Jonael Memorial would be in order.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006188	We cannot do this any more.{nl}Please, get to the memorial first.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006189	While you are removing the magic circles, I have been grasping the movements of the demons.{nl}Then suddenly, they all headed towards Jonael Hall.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006190	{nl}They probably lured us in by setting up those magic circles and try to beat us to the punch.{nl}Be haste and go to the Hall.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006191	I am counting on you again to retrieve the trace.{nl}We need more than two traces.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006192	{nl}I will be on the look out for the demons.{nl}I need to monitor them carefully.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006193	Thank you doing this.{nl}We must get those traces of Goddess Ausrine before the demons do.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006194	What happened to the trace?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006195	{nl}Nummer.{nl}Now the score is even.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006196	{nl}With these only, I cannot figure out the whereabouts of Goddess Ausrine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006197	All done.{nl}Next stop, the residential area.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006198	The evil magic is exuding nearby. But no worries, the divine energy detector orb will work.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006199	Godspeed.{nl}I will pray hard for your safe and triumphant return.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006200	Not much is known about Demon Lord Diena.{nl}My guess is that Diena is a silent and obedient type. It's only my guess, though.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006201	{nl}But Diena do work for Gesti directly.{nl}Be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006202	I have examined the traces.{nl}I do have a hunch but too early to tell.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006203	{nl}I am terribly sorry but could you investigate the rubbles in the area?{nl}The fragments of processed stones or the altar might be there.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006204	Please, investigate the rubbles.{nl}The rubbles in Jonael Memorial the area where the trace was found. They are the ones.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006205	{nl}I need more rubbles to turn my conjecture into conviction.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006206	If my expectation does not betray me...{nl}Something astounding happened even before Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006207	Have you find something from the rubbles?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006208	You retrieved them.{nl}Let me examine them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006209	These fragments...I knew it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006210	Yes, these are indeed from the altar of Goddess Ausrine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006211	She arrived here right before Medzio Diena.{nl}If I am remembering correctly, she began her journey here shortly before Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006212	{nl}The traces are from different objects.{nl}Ritual devices or fragments of the altar.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006213	{nl}Regardless, they are related to the altar.{nl}These traces not only contain her power but also faint energy of the Divine Tree.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006214	{nl}Just as I thought, Goddess Ausrine has built altars at five different places.{nl}She used her divine energy and these ritual tools to set up a barrier.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006215	{nl}When Medzio Diena occurred, she like all the other goddesses, lost her power.{nl}But the barrier she set up drew its power away from the Divine Tree.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006216	{nl}Transferring the energy gained back to Goddess Ausrine.{nl}That probably... no certainly made it possible to retain her power.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006217	{nl}That is why the demons were seeking these traces so badly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006218	{nl}Thank you so much.{nl}Without your help. these truths never have been discovered.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006219	{nl}We cannot fully determine her location but...{nl}This news will certainly appease other goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006220	The important fact is that Goddess Ausrine retained her power. But still her whereabouts is a mystery.{nl}Further investigation of this area might yield some results.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006221	{nl}If the clues are here, the demons will continue to swarm in.{nl}I am fully aware that you have done so immensely for me but could you help me a bit further?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006222	{nl}If we set up an alarming device, we will be able to detect the demons immediately.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006223	If then, could you get some of demon energy?{nl}I need to make the device that can recognize the energy pattern and sound the alarm.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006224	{nl}I do have the crystal but I need the demon energy to calibrate.{nl}Oh the task wouldn't be that difficult for you, Savior.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006225	{nl}Attack and stun ragbirds and ragged butchers and absorb their energies.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006226	When the demons are weakened, seal their power.{nl}I will, like always, await your triumphant and victorious return.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006227	That seems to be enough.{nl}I will put them into the alarm crystal right away.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006228	Thanks to you, the alarm crystal is complete.{nl}And it works beautifully.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006229	Now, all that is left is installing it at the sight of the traces.{nl}Just placing it would do the trick.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006230	There are still some demons left around here, so please be careful.{nl}The crystal itself has a barrier of its own but it activates after its initial installation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006231	Before you install this, wipe out the vicinity.{nl}After that merely placing it will work itself.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006232	I will examine further into the traces.{nl}Also, I will see if the alarm gets here without a problem.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006233	Thank you so much for your hard work.{nl}I pray we could get some information on her.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006234	But at least knowing the fact that she has retained her powers is a great discovery.{nl}The all matter involving Demon Lord Diena does trouble me but it's not our top priority for now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006235	{nl}I pray your path is blessed by Goddess.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006236	Huh?{nl}I'm sorry, that was unexpected.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006237	{nl}A fairy turning into Demon King, that is astounding.{nl}What is even more astounding is regaining its memory and co-operating with us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006238	{nl}And Diena was dragged away by  Rexipher?{nl}I sense an struggle and conflict inside the demon force.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006239	{nl}But thanks heavens for retrieving all the traces of Goddess Ausrine.{nl}These will help our investigation on the whereabouts of her.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006240	I firmly believe that if we keep examine these traces, we will one day find her.{nl}Even if we don't, it is worth fighting for.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006241	Are you saying that they are having an arguement between themselves?{nl}A demon that has issues with Gesti...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006242	What do you think could have happened?{nl}Do you think this has anything to do with it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006243	We need to find the traces quickly.{nl}The demons have set up magic circles at the central square.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006244	They interfere with the divine energy detector orb.{nl}We need to disable them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006245	The interference magic circles are makeshifts.{nl}You can probably disable them just by stepping on them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006246	We must retrieve the traces of Goddess Ausrine before they fall into the hands of the demons.{nl}We must hurry.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006247	You've returned!{nl}Wait, something not right.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006248	The contents of the orders and the general vibe from the demons spell some inner conflicts.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006249	{nl}But at the moment, the most important task is retrieval of the traces.{nl}The demons did take away the trace in the hall, after all.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006250	According to the document, there are five traces in total.{nl}We must get the remaining ones.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006251	One of the places mentioned is Jonael Residential area.{nl}The area certainly exudes a great amount of the divine energy. But unfortunately, the evil energy as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006252	Demon Lord Diena might be around.{nl}I will prepare for the worst. There might be more of those interference magic circles.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006253	I will enhance the divine energy detector orb so that it won't get affected by the interferences and{nl}make you undetectable by a Demon Lord.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006254	{nl}If possible, please, get me some of the fragments of the interference magic circles that you've disabled?{nl}I will use them to enchant the orb.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006255	{nl}The magic stone fragments can be obtained from ragbirds and ragged butchers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006256	Please, be quick.{nl}We haven't got much time on our hands.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006257	You've gotten them all!{nl}Yes, yes. They are more than enough.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006258	You are now well trained enough to shoot the oncoming enemy fast and precise.{nl}My, you really have grown, haven't ya?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006259	Before I let you in on the last set of skills, you need to prove how much you have grown.{nl}If what I see in you is true, it won't be difficult.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006260	Some of companions for our mercenary group have fallen ill.{nl}From what we know, the Hackapell Master is the person to visit.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006261	{nl}But the medicine supply is not abundant. And we got left out.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006262	{nl}As luck would have it, the Pardoner Master said there was some debt between them and if you help the Pardoner Master.{nl}The cure is secured.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006263	{nl}It's a bit unnerving but the most important aspect of being a Schwazer Reiter is mobiliuty derived from our trusty companions.{nl}At the moment, the group needs some mediating, so, I cannot go myself.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006264	{nl}It would be great if you can carry out the Pardoner Master's request.{nl}The task is not too daunting and it would be a great opportunity for you to prove your strength.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006265	{nl}I did hear that there are some drifted onto Cranto Coast, Igti Coast and Vera Coast.{nl}The coins were found but most of them were taken by the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006266	{nl}The Pardoner Master wants you to retrieve the old commemorative coins.{nl}10 of them would be enough.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006267	On Igti Coast, the biggest drifter has been found.{nl}Incidentally, it is the most difficult places of all three. So, the choice is yours.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006268	Let us not waste time, we cannot let our companions suffer anymore.{nl}Besides, speed is the life of a mercenary, after all.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006269	Excellent!{nl}You are earlier than I expected.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006270	I must approve of your strength.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006271	I don't doubt you will do great hunting along with your partner.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006272	Go to Khonot Forest and you will find a giant monster called Gosal. Defeat it and get its horn.{nl}It will not be too difficult for you and your partner.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006273	Now, that is impressive.{nl}That is why I will teach you the high end skills.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006274	Prove that how well you can handle your hawk to me.{nl}Are you ready?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006275	The target is Gosal of Khonot Forest.{nl}It is a giant bull-like monster.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006276	Get his horn.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006277	How did it go?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006278	Hmm... this is Gosal Horn.{nl}I never doubted you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006279	Now, let the final lesson begin.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006280	Ah, there you are.{nl}You are just in time. I have a favor to ask of you.

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006285	Are you interested in the combat skills of a hackapell?
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006286	{nl}We charge straight to the front line along with our companions.{nl}Our path is somewhat different from that of other archers who support the team from behind.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006287	{nl}But first I must test whether you have got what it takes.{nl}So I am currently working on the request from the Pardoner Master.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006288	{nl}So, could you help me concentrate on that task by taking care of the rest?{nl}From what I see, it would be a great opportunity for you to prove yourself.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006289	On Grynas Hills, you will find an old sanctuary.{nl}Now, it is a training ground for Dievdirbys. The forest energy will gather up around the sanctuary.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006290	{nl}While you are busy filling up the forest energy, I will take care of the Pardoner Master's request.{nl}The task involving the forest energy itself is not difficult but I have got too many at hands.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006291	{nl}Moreover, nowadays the monsters in the forest have gone feral. A perfect opportunity to prove yourself, isn't it?{nl}Here, take this crystal and fill it up with the forest energy.

QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006293	The forest energy boosts up the companion medicine's performance.{nl}Well, even without the boost, I only make the best in the kingdom.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006294	I am counting on you on the matter regarding the crystal.{nl}Please, don't slack off.
QUEST_LV_0300_20161005_006295	Do it for the companions. Please do the best.
