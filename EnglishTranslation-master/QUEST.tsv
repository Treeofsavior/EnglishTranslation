QUEST_20150317_000663	Flurry... turned into a handful of ashes by illuminating a great light. {nl}Did that demon do something? {nl}I had no idea, even as a wizard apprentice.

QUEST_20150317_000672	The Pedigree of Magic

QUEST_20150317_000675	The research twisted previous notions of time and space, {nl}which were beyond the changes of the body, {nl}and the rules of physics and the elements progressed significantly.
QUEST_20150317_000676	The Report of the High Barrier Magic
QUEST_20150317_000677	The barrier in this tower could not have possibly been created by the Demon Lord alone.
QUEST_20150317_000678	It acts like a tight-knit net. {nl}Someone with a normal level of divine power cannot escape from it.
QUEST_20150317_000679	For what reason was this barrier created?{nl}Is it related to the fact that the goddess who controls the flames of this world is staying here?
QUEST_20150317_000680	Agailla Flurry called Gabija to this tower, so this barrier is not meant to lock Gabija in. {nl}To find out the reason for this, we first have to understand the composition of the barrier.
QUEST_20150317_000681	After a long investigation, we've found that this barrier was {nl}not only created with the power of Helgasercle, but rather blended with mana of different wavelengths.
QUEST_20150317_000682	We've also found that mana was composed by aligning the foundation stones in a certain position.
QUEST_20150317_000683	We were able to retrieve some of those foundation stones from various areas in the kingdom. {nl}The new information that we learned from them was astonishing.
QUEST_20150317_000684	The mana provided to use barrier magic wasn't voluntary. {nl}We theorize that the levels of the Demon Lords were divided and sealed into the foundation stones and aligned into a position.
QUEST_20150317_000685	The key to unlock this barrier is in the foundation. {nl}We'll continue to search for the answer after we block Helgasercle's invasion.
QUEST_20150317_000686	The Understanding of Mana
QUEST_20150317_000687	Unlike priests who control the blessing of the goddess directly, {nl}the wizard is defined as a person who releases various magic information or the blessing of the goddess.
QUEST_20150317_000688	Okay so, what is mana? {nl}We can say the true quality of mana is the life force on this land. {nl}The life force of nature. It doesn't just imply the length of lives.
QUEST_20150317_000689	The life force is a form of energy that composes this world and it spreads like branches to various places in the world. {nl}If you could find the source of that energy, you may obtain astonishing power.
QUEST_20150317_000690	The Diary of Antares' Investigation
QUEST_20150317_000691	As I was investigating mana, I discovered one important fact: {nl}The mana which flows steadily in the Mage Tower behaves strangely on the top of the tower
QUEST_20150317_000692	After lengthy research, I found out that there is a third type of energy which is {nl}different from the types of mana we know of, and it has a shape of a specific object.
QUEST_20150317_000693	This object must be from the era of Agailla Flurry as no one knows the existence of this object.
QUEST_20150317_000694	I am sure that this object will bring a new beginning of magic, {nl}but since it is separated at the highest place atop the tower, we have no way to reach it.
QUEST_20150317_000695	We can't demolish the tower nor destroy part of it just to get it.
QUEST_20150317_000696	I will end my writing by stating that this object has more to be investigated.

QUEST_20150317_001079	Revelation of Mage Tower
QUEST_20150317_001080	This is an old story of Fedimian before the Goddess Statue was built.
QUEST_20150317_001081	A long time ago, the people of Fedimian were quite normal, {nl}not much different from the ordinary people of the rest of the world. {nl}However, the people of Fedimian did differ from their worldly peers in one aspect.
QUEST_20150317_001082	The people of Fedimian were very cautious.{nl}In the sense that they take the word 'cautious' much more seriously. {nl}These people were as cautious around fire as they were without.
QUEST_20150317_001083	The Fedimians were modest about this with others. {nl}Even those who stayed at Fedimian for a while could not pick up the trait.
QUEST_20150317_001084	Thanks to this behavior, the people of Fedimian fared better during tough times, {nl}as they were able to sense danger coming.
QUEST_20150317_001085	Because of this, no few words were said about the cautiousness of the Fedimian people.
QUEST_20150317_001086	In Fedimian, if someone dropped money on the ground, it would be gone forever. {nl}In a world where money mostly consists of silver coins, {nl}only the creditors would know exactly how much money has been lost in this manner.
QUEST_20150317_001087	Why money disappears into the ground at Fedimian remains unknown. {nl}Some people believe the Goddess Zemyna absorbs any money that makes contact with her area. {nl}Most commoners, however, believe this was done to reduce the demand of silver coins from creditors.
QUEST_20150317_001088	By believing that the goddess herself takes the silver,{nl}the people found it pointless to try and dig it up in her grounds. {nl}The fact that you can offer silver coins at Fedimian as tribute to her reinforces this idea.
QUEST_20150317_001089	In any case, the fact that one could lose money by dropping it on Fedimian soil {nl}has made Fedimians very careful in handling their money.
QUEST_20150317_001090	However, as much as one tries to be careful, mistakes still happen. {nl}More so with the case of young girls. {nl}One day, it happened to a girl named Aiste.
QUEST_20150317_001091	Normally, when one drops silver coins on the ground, it would scatter about on the road, {nl}and then disappear without a trace. {nl}{nl}Fedimians usually curse their own carelessness and move on, {nl}but Aiste was different: she wondered why and how it happened.
QUEST_20150317_001092	To find out what happened, Aiste began inspecting the area she lost her coins at. {nl}In her search she came across a beggar beside the deep end of the canal.
QUEST_20150317_001093	Aiste asked the elderly beggar, {nl}'Did you by any chance pick up the silver coins I dropped? {nl}{nl}Would you return them to me?{nl}I worked very hard everyday for those coins and really need them.'
QUEST_20150317_001094	The beggar was taken aback. Aiste was asking for the impossible. {nl}After all, finding dropped coins in Fedimian was unthinkable. {nl}The old beggar was about to explain this to Aiste, but instead remarked, {nl}'I've also lost coins in this area. It would be nice if you looked for mine as you searched for yours.'
QUEST_20150317_001095	Almost immediately, the beggar felt guilty of the mocking words he blurted out. He apologized to Aiste.
QUEST_20150317_001096	Why don't you go to where you work and explain what happened to them? Make sure you look lost.' The beggar then hesitantly added, {nl}'In the meantime, I'll be looking for your silver coins here.'
QUEST_20150317_001097	Upon hearing the beggar's words, Aiste thanked the beggar, and went on to follow his advice. {nl}Through his selfless act, the beggar suddenly felt a revived sense of responsibility. He looked toward the silhouette of the leaving Aiste, his heart heavy and warm from this experience.
QUEST_20150317_001098	Aiste went to the orchards at the outskirts of Fedimian where she worked. {nl}While one could just pick fruit from the trees there, it was also important to take the fruit that fell on the ground.
QUEST_20150317_001099	Smaller hands worked better for picking fruits, so young children were often hired at the orchards. {nl}Some orchards took it a step further: hiring monkeys, whose hands were smaller than that of children, to pick fruit. Monkeys did work more effectively than children, but often ate the fruit they picked. Thus, most owners relied on hiring children.
QUEST_20150317_001100	Returning, Aiste visited the orchard she worked at and explained her situation to the orchard owner. {nl}Unfortunately, the owner was not in a good mood, having just had a quarrel with his wife. {nl}He, like all other Fedimians, knew about the phenomenon, and saw no reason to give Aiste more money.
QUEST_20150317_001101	And so he said, {nl}'Just as you've been able to pick up all my fruit, you should be able to find your lost money at Fedimian, so do not tell me to give you a second pay.' {nl}The orchard owner's cold words brought tears to the girl's eyes. {nl}The sight broke his heart, but even so, he did not want to give her any more money.
QUEST_20150317_001102	He was soon overtaken by guilt and said, {nl}'If you really need that money, you should go to the silversmith's.'
QUEST_20150317_001103	Aiste set towards the silversmith's place as soon as she heard those words. {nl}Fortunately, the house was located outside Fedimian walls. {nl}Had it been inside, the silversmith ran the risk of losing his money and silverware to the soil.
QUEST_20150317_001104	It is for this reason that he lives on the outskirts of Fedimian. {nl}Aiste knocked on the front door and explained her situation to him as soon as he answered.
QUEST_20150317_001105	The silversmith, after hearing Aiste's story, stated, {nl}'Even for children it is foolish to be so careless. How could you not know that all money that falls on Fedimian soil disappears, never to be found again?'
QUEST_20150317_001106	Aiste was surprised by what the silversmith said and grew sad. {nl}After a while she asked, {nl}'Then why is it that such a cruel thing happens?'
QUEST_20150317_001107	Even the silversmith did not know the true answer, so he improvised, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna must be taking them.'
QUEST_20150317_001108	Hearing those words, Aiste replied, {nl}'Then I will just have to go ask the goddess.' {nl}The silversmith was astounded and replied, {nl}'While you're at it, why don't you ask the goddess to return my silverware?'
QUEST_20150317_001109	The silversmith did not take to heart his own words, but Aiste did. {nl}She immediately set out to do as she said. The silversmith felt sorry for Aiste, {nl}but did not have the courage to call her back as she faded into the distance.
QUEST_20150317_001110	An exhausted Aiste soon arrived at Zemyna's Goddess Statue. {nl}She prostrated herself before it and prayed to the Goddess Statue, her head completely down. {nl}'Oh, Goddess. Please return my lost silver coins.' {nl}Soon, while offering her prayers, Aiste could no longer hold in her sadness and she finally wept.
QUEST_20150317_001111	How long did she pray crying? {nl}Suddenly, Aiste heard a voice addressed to her. {nl}'My child, have you come to take back what you have lost?'
QUEST_20150317_001112	Aiste knew in her heart that it was Goddess Zemyna that was addressing her. {nl}She stopped crying, cleared her voice and replied so.
QUEST_20150317_001113	The goddess' voice was heard again. {nl}'Aiste, what you're asking of me is not by a method I approve of. Where I reign there is no harvest nor fruits for those who do not work.'
QUEST_20150317_001114	But I worked very hard today!'
QUEST_20150317_001115	I know. So instead, I will give you and the others a chance. Look under your feet.'
QUEST_20150317_001116	The goddess' voice faded with those words, and Aiste found silver coins under her feet. {nl}She looked to where she had left her silvers and found that the tears she shed had transformed into coins.{nl}Aiste was very happy, and made sure to pick up all the silver before leaving.
QUEST_20150317_001117	After a number of steps, Aiste thought about the silversmith, {nl}and, again, went to his house and knocked on his door. {nl}As if the silversmith was waiting for her return, he opened the door immediately and said. {nl}'I'm sorry. I regret sending you away like that. I'll give you some silver. {nl}This time, be careful not to drop any and get home safely.'
QUEST_20150317_001118	As the silversmith held out his silver coins, Aiste shook her head and said,{nl}'No thank you, the goddess returned all my coins. On top of that, she gave me even more. {nl}I remembered you saying you had also lost silver, so I came to give you my extra coins. You don't need to give me yours.'
QUEST_20150317_001119	At first, the silversmith was skeptical about the coins being returned, {nl}so he was surprised when Aiste showed him genuine coins. After thinking for a while, the silversmith said, {nl}'Then how about this. You give me what you want while you accept what I was about to give you. {nl}Isn't that fair? On top of that I'll give you a pouch to carry your extra silver.'
QUEST_20150317_001120	Aiste obliged and gave her extra coins to the silversmith. {nl}After this, the silversmith gave Aiste a bag of coins.
QUEST_20150317_001121	After leaving the silversmith's house, {nl}Aiste suddenly remembered that the old beggar must still be looking for her lost coins and worried for him. {nl}On her way to the beggar, she met the orchard owner again. {nl}Upon seeing Aiste, the orchard owner was overjoyed. {nl}'I was looking for you. I'm sorry for sending you off earlier. As an apology, I'll give you your salary again. {nl}Please be careful not to lose it this time.'
QUEST_20150317_001122	The orchard owner took out a large amount of coins, more than what Aiste's salary was, and handed it to her. {nl}However, Aiste shook her head and said, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna already returned my money to me. The silversmith also helped me, so now I actually have too much. {nl}Here, take a look.'
QUEST_20150317_001123	Saying that, Aiste opened the bag of coins she got from the silversmith and showed the orchard owner. {nl}The orchard owner was extremely surprised, as the amount of money she got from the goddess and the silversmith surpassed the amount he had.
QUEST_20150317_001124	Disregarding the amount Aiste had shown him, the orchard owner said, {nl}'Well, even so, I would be ashamed for not giving you my due, so please just take it.' {nl}After saying this, the orchard owner stuffed his coins into Aiste's bag and left. {nl}By the time Aiste could muster up the energy to call the orchard owner, he was too far away.
QUEST_20150317_001125	She hesitated for a moment but then set her mind on the beggar. {nl}After a bit of walking, Aiste arrived at where they met. The old beggar spotted her first and hurried over to her. {nl}He showed her the silver coins he was clenching onto and said, 'Look! I found your lost silver.' {nl}Aiste received the beggar's silver and then showed the beggar her bag and said, {nl}'Look, I found your silver coins too.'
QUEST_20150317_001126	Even though the beggar was exhausted, he cupped his hands to get his coins back. {nl}Seeing this, Aiste was brought to the brink of tears. {nl}She wondered how much begging the beggar had to do to give her her coins back. {nl}With a heavy heart, Aiste gave the old beggar the coins.
QUEST_20150317_001127	After that, Aiste also held out her bag and said, {nl}'This is a gift as thanks for looking for my silver. I was given this through Goddess Zemyna's grace.' {nl}Aiste then left before the Old Beggar could figure out how to reply.
QUEST_20150317_001128	The beggar looked towards Aiste's distant shadow, and opened the present she gave him, {nl}curious to what was inside. Inside, he was surprised to find dozens of silver coins. {nl}Now he understood why Aiste was able to depart much more quickly than she arrived - she had lightened her load by giving him the excess.
QUEST_20150317_001129	For a beggar who had been stingy over a single silver coin, the fact Aiste could simply give away several tens of times that amount moved him. {nl}The fact that Aiste, who had went off and solved the mystery of Fedimian, came back and gave him what she really didn't owe, made the beggar thankful.
QUEST_20150317_001130	The more he thought, the less the beggar was able to hold back his tears. {nl}As he cried, he noticed something odd - every shining teardrop that touched the ground transformed to silver coins.
QUEST_20150317_001131	The beggar could not believe his eyes, but quickly remembered Aiste words about a blessing from the goddess. {nl}After a while, the beggar stopped crying, and went to pick up the coins and put them in the bag Aiste gave him.
QUEST_20150317_001132	A few days later, the beggar went to the statue that Aiste prayed to. There, he took out one coin from the bag to keep, and offered the rest to the Goddess Statue. {nl}He then prayed to the goddess whole-heartedly and left. As the money he offered disappeared, the beggar again to shed tears, but that's another story.
QUEST_20150317_001133	After a few days, an odd rumor spread across Fedimian. {nl}The rumor claimed that silver no longer disappeared into Fedimian soil. {nl}The rumor did not sit well at first with older, experienced people, but some tested the rumor with a paltry amount of silver, {nl}and it turned out to be true. Everyone agreed that finally, the mysterious phenomenon of Fedimian has come to an end.
QUEST_20150317_001134	After some time, word of this occurrence reached the king. Curious as to why this happened, the king ordered an investigation. {nl}The hidden truth was brought to light, and Aiste's story was known.
QUEST_20150317_001135	The king praised the people that caused the miracle with their charitable hearts. {nl}Additionally, to honor the grace of the goddess, he decided to spend the national treasury to build a large statue dedicated to her.
QUEST_20150317_001136	On the day the statue was finally completed, {nl}something miraculous happened as the King and Aiste went together to make the first offering. {nl}From the circumference of the statue sprouted coins - all the silver coins that had been lost by Fedimians up until that time.
QUEST_20150317_001137	After heated debate, the Fedimian people decided to not to hoard their lost silver coins. {nl}Instead, they asked the king to collect all the coins and distribute them among the poor of the Kingdom. {nl}The king readily agreed, and gave the order to record this beautiful event into the history of the Kingdom.
QUEST_20150317_001138	Even now, nobody knows when and how the mysterious phenomenon of Fedimian started, {nl}but everybody knows when, how, and who helped unravel the mystery. {nl}It was through the kindness of Aiste and the people who helped her, as well as through the grace of the goddess, that the mystery came to an end.
QUEST_20150317_001139	The Gambler of Klaipeda
QUEST_20150317_001140	The Gambler of Klaipeda {nl}~A Short Story~
QUEST_20150317_001141	{nl}{nl}In the town of Klaipeda, there once lived a man by the name of Modestas. {nl}He was a good, honest man - but had one major flaw that his friends and family all worried about, his wife especially so. {nl}Modestas was not lazy nor very clever nor not too foolish. {nl}He did not drink or repeatedly get into fights. {nl}The man had one flaw, and it was that he loved to gamble.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001142	During the day, Modestas would work hard and would never let himself go hungry - {nl}but whenever he earned more than he really needed, he would gamble. {nl}The wife would always try to save this money, but not one extra coin would ever go toward their home.
QUEST_20150317_001143	Whenever she could, Modestas' wife would often go to the shrine, and pray to the goddess' likeness. {nl}But Modestas continued his odd habits, and the people around him grew increasingly concerned. {nl}After all, the mind of a gambler would think, 'Today it may be small, but tomorrow it could be big!' {nl}And so the days rolled by, same as they ever were, until one peculiar day.
QUEST_20150317_001144	Like most of his days, Modestas was heading home after gambling away his excess coins. {nl}He was walking through the Siauliai Woods on the path to Klaipeda, when he saw a strange, old woman on the road.
QUEST_20150317_001145	This old woman seemed not only old and frail, but had an unnerving aura around her. {nl}She was acting strangely, as if deep in thought or as if she was obsessed with whatever she was doing. {nl}Modestas thought about simply ignoring the woman and walking past. Nothing would have happened if he did that, {nl}but curiosity got the better of him.
QUEST_20150317_001146	To be precise, what really turned his head toward the old woman was what she held in her hands. {nl}Gold. The woman seemed to be obsessing over two gold pieces, doing something with them. {nl}Unable to hear her mumbling, Modestas drew closer to the strange woman.
QUEST_20150317_001147	Over the jingling sound of gold, the old woman muttered. {nl}'If these two pieces of gold could ever marry, the baby gold would make me rich... but there's no life in these things...' {nl}Modestas heard those words, and decided to comment. {nl}'That gold won't make you rich by itself, so just put it into something worthwhile. {nl}Do you really think muttering at gold will do something?'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001148	The old woman spoke plainly, 'Why not? If it works, this'll certainly be the most pleasant, risk-free way to wealth.' {nl}'That's ridiculous. You should do what I do and gamble.' {nl}The woman was incensed.
QUEST_20150317_001149	'So, you think your betting ways are better?' {nl}'Why wouldn't I? There are moments where I could win or lose, but your way won't make any gold at all.' {nl}With Modestas' words, the old woman paused in thought. Finally, she said, {nl}'Then let's have a bet.'
QUEST_20150317_001150	The disturbing aura around her grew as soon as the offer reached Modestas' ears. He couldn't outright refuse. {nl}'What kind of bet?' {nl}'We'll see whether your way or my way will make us richer.' {nl}'And if I lose?'
QUEST_20150317_001151	'Don't worry about that. You will win, and you will lose - that won't change. The rules are fixed.' {nl}'What do you mean by that?' {nl}'By taking my offer, you will fail once, and you will win once. No matter what happens.' {nl}'Well, yeah. Winning and losing is how gambling works.'
QUEST_20150317_001152	'No. No matter how unlucky things may seem, you will win your first gamble. {nl}And then, no matter how favorable life may seem, you will fail the next.'
QUEST_20150317_001153	Modestas was still confused by these strange words. {nl}'So, you're saying I'll win on every odd bet, and lose on every even one?' {nl}'Yes. It will be so. You will win some, and then you won't. Is that not fair? {nl}One coin will be enough to succeed, no matter how many bets you make. That is my offer.' {nl}'You think I'll switch between winning and losing, huh?'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001154	With her hand to her chin, the old woman gave a puzzling response. {nl}'Three times each should be enough. Return to me after you make six gambles. {nl}Naturally, if you don't have more coin after your sixth bet, I will win.'
QUEST_20150317_001155	Modestas seemed to tremble. 'How much should I earn, then?' {nl}'You'll start with one gold piece,' she replied, 'and when you return, show me all your gold pieces but that one. {nl}If you stretch that single piece to anything more, then you win. As for time... you have one week.' {nl}'So, what do you get when I lose?' Modestas reminded her.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001156	'Well...' the old woman lingered, 'If you win, everyone will know about my gold - {nl}and you'll have the power of winning and losing. On the other hand...' {nl}''On the other hand...'?' Modestas said, tensely.
QUEST_20150317_001157	'After I win, the friends you know will disappear every time you lose a bet.' {nl}Modestas was unnerved by the conditions set. He did not immediately object; instead, he thought of victory, {nl}and soon accepted. Modestas was, most of all, the kind of person who never backed down.
QUEST_20150317_001158	As Modestas and the old woman parted ways, he, in any case, knew he now had a dangerous power guaranteeing his victory at any time in the near future. {nl}He walked, looking for the next person to bet huge on. As he wondered how much to wager on his next move, he heard the sound of galloping behind him.
QUEST_20150317_001159	Modestas turned around. It was his good old friend, Sigfried, riding on horseback towards him. {nl}They knew each other well, as both had been together through the highs and lows of gambling. They exchanged greetings and talked about where they were going. Sigfried dismounted to walk at a leisurely pace with his friend, idly chatting along their way. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001160	However, before long, Modestas could no longer continue walking with Sigfried. {nl}He was fully aware of his deadline, and had no time for such trivial activities. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001161	Even during their normal everyday conversations, Modestas and Sigfried unconsciously made big and small bets. Eventually, one would utter the word, 'Bet?' unconsciously. {nl}Neither of them were rich so these bets weren't ever that significant. Knowing this would trigger the curse, Modestas really wanted to ask Sigfried to leave. {nl}In the end, Modestas uttered these words: {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001162	'Are you not busy? You seemed to be in a hurry on your horse before you passed by for a talk. You should stop worrying about me and go.' {nl}Sigfried, hearing Modestas' words, replied, {nl} 'I was busy, but I still have time to walk with you for another ten minutes or so. This horse might not look like much, but when it comes down to it, he can go pretty fast.' {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001163	Seeing Sigfried not budge, Modestas tried again to persuade him, {nl}'Wouldn't it be better to be early as opposed to be on time?' {nl}{nl}Hearing this, Sigfried became adamant, {nl}'Do you not believe what I just said, or are you willfully ignoring it all?' {nl}A disconcerted Modestas said, {nl}'No, I didn't mean it like that...' {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001164	However, before Modestas could say any more, Sigfried said, 'If you don't believe me, why don't we have a bet?' {nl}{nl}Naturally, the words, 'Sure. What do you want to wager?' rose up in Modestas' throat.
QUEST_20150317_001165	Considering Modestas' habit, to not immediately accept a gamble took superhuman willpower from him. {nl}'What... What kind of bet?' {nl}'We're going to bet on whether my horse is fast or not.' {nl}Modestas desperately fought against his inner gambler.
QUEST_20150317_001166	On the other hand, Sigfried was understandably confident, knowing with certainty that he would win the gamble, and was alright with betting his horse. {nl}With only a little money at hand, the bet became too good to refuse, and Modestas finally accepted. {nl}And, as expected, Modestas won. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001167	As soon as the bet started, Sigfried tried every method possible to command his horse to move. Despite his efforts, it didn't move a single hoof at all.{nl}At the end, Sigfried repeatedly cursed its strange behavior. Realizing he'd be late to his appointment without a horse, he threw the reins to Modestas and sprinted away.{nl}As Sigfried disappeared, Modestas felt uncomfortable.
QUEST_20150317_001168	For Modestas, who had always been elated upon winning bets and depressed upon losing them, to win and feel depressed was a first in his entire life. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001169	Knowing he had just deceived his long-time gambling friend, Sigfried, and also missed an opportunity to earn a lot of money, Modestas felt conflicted as he walked slowly alongside the horse he had just won. {nl}While walking, Modestas remembered the earlier warnings of his unconditional bet. He realized that now, with his upcoming defeat, he was doomed to not earn any more silver than he started with.
QUEST_20150317_001170	While walking along the road, Modestas encountered a group of soldiers. {nl}Upon looking closer, the soldiers seemed to be arguing about what to buy at a store. {nl}Modestas decided not to interfere and pass them, but the soldiers noticed him and called. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001171	'You, the young man with the horse, can you come over and help us for a bit?' {nl}Modestas had no idea what these soldiers needed help for, but since he could no longer ignore them, he decided to head over. {nl}Once Modestas arrived, one of the soldiers said, {nl}'You came at just the right time. We would like you to referee a small gamble we're about to make here.' {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001172	Modestas was surprised when he heard the word, 'gamble', but was relieved to know he was only being asked to referee. After all, nothing could possibly happen if he was just refereeing. {nl}Modestas learned that the soldiers were fighting over which goddess was the best. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001173	What started as trivial banter turned into a big argument, which finally grew to become a big money bet. The soldiers had already gathered their money and only had to decide the winner. Unfortunately, every goddess got equal votes and a winner couldn't be decided.{nl}Thus, the soldiers decided to settle the bet by calling the first person who passed by, asking him who he thought the best goddess is, and deciding the winner from there. The soldiers agreed that the first passer-by would symbolize the will of whatever goddess he favored. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001174	The soldiers did not tell Modestas who voted for which goddess, for fear of his decision being affected by the expressions of each individual soldier. {nl}The soldiers did tell him however, how much they have each wagered. Just by seeing the gold nuggets, he could easily figure that there was a large amount of money in this bet. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001175	Since a big jackpot was on the line, the soldiers waited with bated breath for Modestas' answer. {nl}Knowing there was no right answer to the question, Modestas simply said aloud the name of his own favorite goddess. {nl}When he did, the soldiers reacted strangely. {nl}There was supposed to be an ecstatic winner and disappointed losers, but nobody seemed joyful nor disappointed. Instead, everyone had a bewildered look on their faces. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001176	Modestas, perplexed by their reaction, asked for an explanation to which one of the soldiers answered, {nl}'We originally had votes for four goddesses but your choice isn't any of them, so now we have five goddesses.' {nl}The soldiers then resumed their squabble about how to decide the winner. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001177	The mood began to deteriorate so Modestas wanted to leave. {nl}When he was about to take off, the soldiers blocked his path and accused him. {nl}'It's your fault the argument heated up even more. You're not thinking of just leaving are you?'{nl}Intimidated by the irritated soldiers, Modestas dared not to escape. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001178	In Modestas' mind, he concluded that the quarrelling soldiers didn't have him referee, but simply added him into the bet. In reality however, he had no real claim, so he wasn't in the bet just yet. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001179	Knowing Modestas, he could not simply sit on the sidelines watching a big bet grow. Eventually, he became enticed to join. Modestas, caught in the heat of the moment and ending up participating, finally remembered it was his turn to lose.{nl}But it was too late.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001180	In addition, because the other soldiers had already bet deeply, Modestas had to bet the only gold bullion he had. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001181	If you think about it, even if it was not his turn to lose, all it took for him do so was one more vote for any of the goddesses he didn't choose. With the odds of the next person walking by supporting his goddess being against him, the probability of winning was low anyway.{nl}{nl}However, the victor was chosen unexpectedly. An officer found the soldiers slacking, disciplined them and was about to lead them away. {nl}The soldiers, obeying the superior's command, were about to march off when they shrewdly asked him which goddess he favored. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001182	The officer inadvertently said the name of a goddess, and some of the soldiers began cheering. {nl}The officer, not knowing what was going on, simply ordered his soldiers to move along. In any case, Modestas certainly lost. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001183	Having now lost the gold bullion given to him by the strange old woman, Modestas was now at a loss. {nl}To originally intend to referee, only to end up losing all the gold he had, all while knowing exactly the reason why... Modestas felt heartbroken, dumbfounded, and yet, understanding. A unique feeling. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001184	Although Modestas had just lost money by entering a bet started by others, it was the first time he'd done so in his life. Modestas spent some time thinking of how to better his situation and {nl}suddenly got an idea, knowing he was certain to win his next bet. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001185	If he could call back the soldiers from earlier and bet his horse, he could certainly earn his gold back and possibly more. {nl}Knowing this, Modestas got on his horse, and sped in the direction the soldiers left towards. {nl}{nl}With speed, Modestas soon spotted a stationary wagon. Modestas lowered his speed to check out the wagon parked on the side of the road. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001186	Unfortunately, just as Modestas pulled up at the wagon, his horse suddenly grew agitated, forcing him off. Fortunately, because he had cut his speed and fell on muddy ground, he was not greatly injured. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001187	Someone approached Modestas who had been lying down, hurt, and helped him get back on his feet. He turned out to be one of the people standing on the side, the wagon owner. {nl}The man who helped Modestas uttered with relief, {nl}'I am glad you're not too hurt. Your horse also didn't hurt himself tripping over that pit.'{nl}Modestas noticed a well-hidden pit where he pointed. {nl}The wagon owner continued.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001188	'My horse became injured here and can no longer pull my wagon. It's just an empty wagon, but at any rate, it won't be going anywhere for a while. That's why I have a proposition. Won't you sell me your horse? I believe, with a healthy horse pulling the wagon, even my injured horse can help pull it in some way.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001189	It was an unexpected suggestion, but Modestas needed the horse to quickly find and catch up to the soldiers. He immediately refused the offer.{nl}The wagon owner tried to explain there was no way his injured horse can pull the wagon alone, but Modestas was not persuaded. After his repeated refusal, the wagon owner offered a new suggestion.{nl}'Then let's do this. What if you buy my wagon? I will sell it for cheap. Since my injured horse can't pull the wagon, it will be better off in your hands.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001190	Modestas could see that the wagon was very durable, good-looking and has been well cared for. However, he had no immediate need for a wagon, so he hesitated. {nl}In addition, Modestas had no money now; no matter how low the wagon owner went, he did not have the money to buy it. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001191	The human heart sure can be an amusing thing. {nl}Modestas, deciding the wagon was worth buying but lacking the money to do so, decided he could use his impending victory to win the wagon for free. {nl}So he proposed a bet with the wagon master, risking his own horse. {nl}Naturally, Modestas won. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001192	Modestas, having now just won a wagon and an injured horse, originally intended to keep just the wagon and his original horse. {nl}But seeing as the injured horse wasn't as injured as he thought, he believed he had won big. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001193	In his mind, now that he'd had obtained two horses and a wagon, he believed he was no longer in a bad situation, deciding this time to be very careful not to lose big next. {nl}So, instead of following the soldiers, he decided to go to a place where there was less people. He reined his horse and traveled away from civilization. {nl}However, even in a remote setting, he was bound to meet others. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001194	Rare as it would be, Modestas, while moving about in a uninhabited mountain, encountered an elderly Alchemist. {nl}The old Alchemist sat on a chair on the right side of the road, a silver nugget in hand. {nl}As Modestas passed by for a closer look, the nugget turned out to not be of silver, but of lead. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001195	'Could this Alchemist be one who could turn lead into gold?' thought Modestas, but soon thought he was just overestimating the Alchemist. {nl}But the Alchemist, glad to see someone pass by after a long time, called out to Modestas, and suddenly proposed a bet with him. Somehow, the whole world today seemed to want to make bets with Modestas, and he was getting tired of it. {nl}Modestas liked gambling, but to find opponents this easily was becoming a joke to him. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001196	Modestas was about to do something unlike his being and reject the bet, but the idea that he could wager low moved his mind. {nl}After all, the old Alchemist was wagering a lead nugget. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001197	Because he was certain to lose this time, Modestas believed it would be better to wager and lose against a lead nugget now than to run into people who would wager a large amount of money, and lose later. {nl}Modestas first made sure that he could accept the bet despite having no money at hand and could bring some later, and accepted the bet. No words need to be said about the result. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001199	However, right as the bet was settled, the lead nugget prize let out a sparkle and, in a moment, clearly became gold. {nl}The Old Alchemist now snickered, 'Now you owe me one gold nugget. Be sure to bring it.' {nl}Modestas protested, but as much as he looked, what the old Alchemist now held was clearly no longer lead. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001200	Instead, it was clearly gold, so in the end Modestas had bet and lost against a gold nugget. {nl}A now-tired Modestas ultimately had no way of objecting to the Alchemist. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001201	Now, Modestas had lost more gold than he owed the strange old woman. {nl}And now, he only had one unconditional victory and defeat left. {nl}As Modestas lead his wagon through the rest of the mountain path, he murmured about having to make sure his next win was a very big one. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001202	'This time, no matter what, I have to wage a bet against the world's richest - well maybe not the richest - but a wealthy man at the least.'{nl}As soon as he uttered these words, his surroundings shook like an earthquake and a heavy, deep voice declared.{nl}'I am the richest in this region.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001203	Modestas scanned his surroundings but failed to find anyone. So he asked,{nl}'Who are you?'{nl}The deep, heavy voice answered his question.{nl}'I am where you stand. In your tongue, I am called the mountain.'{nl}Modestas, in disbelief, couldn't help but talk back.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001204	You are... the mountain?'{nl}'That is correct. I am the mountain, and just as you are looking for, the richest around here.'{nl}'You are the mountain? Well, no, even if you are the mountain, how can you claim to be the richest?'{nl}'I own much land, for my sierra stretches far. Further in me, I contain large, valuable lodes.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001205	Hearing about the mountain's valuable lodes revived Modestas' habit. He even knew that this time, he was certain to win. Modestas started persuading the self-proclaiming mountain to make a bet with him. The mountain, unconcerned over winning or losing this bet, agreed. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001206	For a person to have a fateful encounter with a mysterious being like this, even Modestas doubted his own sanity. {nl}In any case, Modestas bet against the mountain's ores, and won.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001207	At the end of the bet, the mountain erupted, and a large boulder landed directly in front of Modestas. It was certainly something, but the boulder didn't seem to be what Modestas expected. For the mountain, this was the gambling debt repaid. {nl}In Modestas' eyes however, there should have been veins of gold, or at least something useful, like copper or coal. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001208	Even if the mountain's veins contained nothing but rocks, he thought he could end up owning a large quarry to dig out valuable stones. Instead, the mountain had paid an inadequate reward.{nl}When Modestas pointed it out, the mountain disagreed. {nl}'All you own are two horses and a wagon.'
QUEST_20150317_001209	'Surely one must wage things of equal value. This boulder is worth as much as you own.'{nl}With that said, the mountain returned to its former self, never to deal with Modestas nor anyone else ever again. {nl}Modestas, in his desperate situation, had wasted his crucial chance just to win one big boulder.{nl}Despite his bad luck, he consoled himself by knowing at least he had horses and a wagon to transport the boulder.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001210	And then suddenly, anxiety struck him. He realized that, although he has an unconditional loss upcoming, given the strange things that happened up to now, he would not be able to easily control the outcome of the final bet. {nl}Nonetheless, Modestas knew he couldn't stay where he was right now, and decided to leave. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001211	Modestas got up and tried to move the boulder, but to no avail. It was simply too large for him to handle by himself. {nl}He considered leaving it behind, but after recalling the mountain's saying that the boulder was worth more than his two horses and wagon combined, he believed that would be a waste. {nl}Supposing he could sell the boulder to a local quarry for a good amount of money, he became troubled and unable to leave. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001212	In front of Modestas, who had been worrying, appeared a familiar figure. It was none other than the one who had started the bet - the suspicious old woman.{nl}The old woman questioned Modestas.{nl}'How is it? Is it going well?'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001213	Modestas confessed he was far from making profits; instead he was in debt, wasted all his chances to win, and only had his last, losing bet remaining.{nl}After listening to his story the old woman responded flatly, {nl}'Since you only have one bet left, go ahead and make your last losing bet. Then all that's left for you to do is pay up your end of the bargain for losing the bet against me.'{nl}Modestas was a man who loved to gamble, but he was not the type to throw a tantrum, nor was he a sore loser.
QUEST_20150317_001214	Modestas knew these gambles were more than just about money. {nl}Modestas, a dedicated gambler, nodded along with the woman's words. He clearly looked to be a man with a huge burden, his facial expression dark. {nl}The old woman could sense Modestas' thoughts, so she made this proposal. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001215	'Since you are unsure how to transport this boulder you suddenly won, how about this? Normally, I wouldn't change the initial conditions, but for my amusement I will give you a suggestion. Why don't you use your last bet to see whether or not I can lift this boulder up into your wagon? Even if you lose, at least you can have this heavy boulder loaded on your wagon.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001216	Modestas who had nothing to lose, nodded his head to accept her proposal. But before he could consent to the bet, the old woman continued. {nl}'But I can't just give you such a favorable idea for free. Therefore I will add one more condition.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001217	When Modestas asked about the condition, the old woman answered.{nl}'You are to take the boulder, which I will load onto the wagon, to Klaipeda. Then, turn it into an object of value which everyone will recognize and esteem. If you are successful, then the punishment for losing the bet against me will become void. Your friends will not disappear. Although this is difficult, I will still give you one more chance since you've already lost the bet. How about it?'{nl}Like always, Modestas had no choice.
QUEST_20150317_001218	The moment Modestas agreed to the proposal, the old woman pointed her finger past him. {nl}Modestas turned around and to his surprise, the boulder he had trouble with was effortlessly placed on the wagon. By the time Modestas looked forward again, the old woman had already disappeared. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001219	Because Modestas had no ropes or equipment to secure the boulder onto the wagon, he had to lean the wagon and carefully drive it to Klaipeda. {nl}On his way to Klaipeda, he again met the soldiers who he had earlier bet against. Their commanding officer was now aware of what had happened thus far, and wanted to apologize to Modestas for getting him caught up and hurt in his subordinates' affairs. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001220	The officer returned Modesta's gold to him, and ordered his soldiers to help him transport the boulder back to Klaipeda. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001221	The officer and solders had sturdy rope, so they were able to transport the rock without worry of it falling off and unload it at Klaipeda. They decided to accompany Modestas all the way there. {nl}Modestas was very grateful for the help. {nl} Along with the soldiers, Modestas again ran into none other than the Alchemist he had lost earlier against.
QUEST_20150317_001222	To Modestas, a promise was a promise, so he immediately handed over the gold the soldiers returned to him to the Alchemist. {nl}The Alchemist, surprised by how Modestas could do this with no complaints or dissatisfaction, took the gold and conversed with him.
QUEST_20150317_001223	Not wanting to be left out of the conversation between Modestas and the Alchemist, the soldiers couldn't continue working, joined in, and learned about the Alchemist's past with Modestas. {nl}The Alchemist apologized to Modestas for turning his lead into gold, and promised to gather all the support he could for Modestas at Klaipeda. He then left. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001224	Soon after, Modestas and the soldiers reached Klaipeda. They set the stone down at the large open space at the center of town. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001225	When the boulder was set in its proper place with the help of the soldiers, the Alchemist who had left returned with another person. The Alchemist had brought with him a famous Dievdirbys.{nl}To the Dievdirbys, the Alchemist suggested, {nl}'Why don't you sculpt a statue of a goddess using this boulder, on this central site of Klaipeda? If this boulder is changed into a statue of a goddess, then nobody in Klaipeda will be able to deny its significance. I think that will fulfill your promise to the old woman.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001226	Everyone who was there favored the idea on the spot. {nl}The Alchemist took the gold he obtained from Modestas and paid it to the Dievdirbys as commission, and went to get permission from the Knight Commander and Bishop of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001227	As news spread, everyone in Klaipeda was pleased to know a Goddess Statue was planned for their city. {nl}However, one last problem remained, asides from winning their favor. And that question was, which goddess should the statue commemorate? {nl}The soldiers who gave help transporting the boulder were especially passionate about this issue, and began quarrelling again. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001228	The one who answered this question was none other than Modestas. {nl}Without any real intent, Modestas argued that the goddesses in power have guided him via divine providence to build a statue at Klaipeda that day. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001229	That the old woman appeared before him, that the many bets occurred, that the mountain erupted a stone for material was the divine providence of the goddesses, argued Modestas, persuading everyone. {nl}Thus, the people decided to follow the words of Modestas, and Modestas relayed to the Dievdirbys the order to create the statue. {nl}When the statue was finally finished, the citizens of Klaipeda gathered, curious to know the identity of the goddess who had been raised in the center of their beloved city.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001230	However, to their bewilderment, not a single soul could recognize the goddess whom the completed statue commemorated.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001231	The Dievdirbys who had sculpted the statue had already vanished deep into the Kateen Forest, so the citizens of Klaipeda repeatedly questioned Modestas for her name. {nl}Despite the numerous questions, nobody received an answer from Modestas. {nl}At any rate, this is the story of how the Goddess Statue of Klaipeda came to be. Even now that statue stands in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001232	And so, some people believed Modestas, having undertaken the goddesses' intervention, was an honest man who did not gamble. In reality, Modestas didn't stop making gambles until his death. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001233	Ever since then, whenever Modestas took on a wager, he always bet the same thing: the answer to the question of who the Statue of Klaipeda honored.{nl}To uncover the name of the goddess, numerous people challenged Modestas to a bet.{nl} {nl}But no matter the impossible odds, Modestas never lost a bet. Nobody was able to win the answer from Modestas for years, and time flew by.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001234	Though Modestas died an undefeated, invincible gambler, he had never bet anything other than the goddess' identity, living purely off the profits gained from such bets through the end of his life. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001235	In the end, this unknown goddess, in exchange for giving a livelihood to a certain gambler from Klaipeda, created an interesting, mysterious, yet beautiful statue for the city of Klaipeda, and a tale to last for times to come.{nl}{nl}

QUEST_20150323_001425	Four scouts were sent to Sirdgela Forest not too long ago but all of them went missing. {nl}Maybe they took the Thorn Forest too lightly... {nl}Please find their whereabouts.
QUEST_20150323_001426	I no longer have the strength to carry on, but will write this for anyone who has made it past this area. {nl}Naktis... it's funny that I yearn for a curse on the Monarch of Curses.
QUEST_20150323_001427	Naktis scattered cursed Tree Root Crystals in the area. {nl}To stop the curse, they must be destroyed.
QUEST_20150323_001428	Perhaps I shall soon lose my breath. {nl}Pilgrims, may the blessings of the goddess be with you!
QUEST_20150323_001429	Please be sure to find the scripture! {nl}One of the pilgrim souls entrapped in here must have it.
QUEST_20150323_001430	All pilgrims should offer different amounts.
QUEST_20150323_001431	This is not a reasonable amount.
QUEST_20150323_001432	Worship the Goddess Statue to receive blessings or move on to another area.
QUEST_20150323_001433	What a nasty curse. {nl}Let's see which is stronger. Naktis' curse or the goddess' purifier.
QUEST_20150323_001434	Of course I have the purifier. {nl}But I'm not giving it to you unless you offer me money.
QUEST_20150323_001435	It could be the one who stole the gypsum carving of the Goddess Statue, so get rid of the monsters there. {nl}If my hunch is right, then Naktis must be behind it. {nl} It might be far away, but I just heard that.
QUEST_20150323_001436	Naktis is looking for a clue to enter the Cathedral. {nl}If I'm right, not only has the Forest of Prayer been affected, but all of the Pilgrim's Way. {nl}Revelator, if you reach the Cathedral, please defeat Naktis. {nl}You must stop the goddess' revelation from falling into demon hands.
QUEST_20150323_001437	This place is dying. {nl}All the Tree Root Crystals have mutated.
QUEST_20150323_001438	Some Tree Root Crystals are useless unless burned. {nl}Some even fume at the core.
QUEST_20150323_001439	We must do whatever it takes to turn it back but... {nl}It's all so tiring now...
QUEST_20150323_001440	I feel like I'm drowning. {nl}The Tree Root Crystal is slowly killing me.
QUEST_20150323_001441	Do whatever it takes to destroy it... {nl}Please help.
QUEST_20150323_001442	I've lost all desire. Am I dying now? {nl}Eating and even breathing feels meaningless.
QUEST_20150323_001443	But it must go on. {nl}Unless that cursed Tree Root Crystal is destroyed...
QUEST_20150323_001444	There are things that Witas cares about. {nl}Won't he get his mind back if you show him those? 
QUEST_20150323_001445	Somebody's Diary
QUEST_20150323_001446	Those brothers are crazy. They must be completely nuts. {nl}When did it start? When Dora attacked Gracius? {nl}When they saw the demons marching?
QUEST_20150323_001447	Things have gone to hell since Gracius was incapacitated. {nl}From the very beginning, while I kept my mouth shut, everyone lusted for bloodshed. {nl}The town was like a volcano waiting to erupt. {nl}I thought it was an educational experience until then.
QUEST_20150323_001448	Then something snapped. {n1}A fellow clergyman, I can't remember who, had murdered Dion in his sleep with a mace and I... {nl}Everyone... {nl}No one could remember why they wanted to become a priest anymore.
QUEST_20150323_001449	This surely is not a teaching of Sir Maven. {nl}Greed? Laziness? How can we call killing one another, 'teaching a lesson'? {nl}I even envy Dion for dying first.
QUEST_20150323_001450	I can hear snickering somewhere. {nl}It could be the sound of Dora deceiving me. {nl}It doesn't really matter any more.
QUEST_20150323_001451	The trapped spirit gave you a scripture and disappeared.
QUEST_20150323_001452	You endured Witas' curse thanks to the medicine.
QUEST_20150323_001453	If you ever see the Devout Tree, please bring it back to life. {nl}I've heard that tree can block the power of the curse.
QUEST_20150323_001454	I believe that the evil will eventually fall and the goddess will be victorious. {nl}The mark of victory is right in front of me.
QUEST_20150323_001455	Anyway, I will go to the battlegrounds first, so please help the Watchers and my followers. {nl}I will see you at Nefritas Cliff.
QUEST_20150323_001456	This isn't over yet. {nl}I'll be watching you from Kvailas Forest.

QUEST_20150323_001463	The Tree Root Crystals of Pilgrim's Way are cursed by Naktis, {nl}as if to mock Sir Maven's teachings against laziness. 
QUEST_20150323_001464	It should be destroyed before the curse spreads. {nl}However, I cannot handle the Tree Root Crystals alone. 
QUEST_20150323_001465	Souls of Pilgrims swallowed by the monsters can destroy the Tree Root Crystal. {nl}Maybe I, too, will be one of them soon.
QUEST_20150323_001466	Notice for Pilgrims

QUEST_20150323_001500	Then don't. Pfft.
QUEST_20150323_001501	You're a bum.
QUEST_20150323_001502	Here. You're more pathetic than I am...
QUEST_20150323_001503	Ah, what's up? 
QUEST_20150323_001504	Farming alone keeps me busy.
QUEST_20150323_001505	I'm not sure yet... about that... rebellion.
QUEST_20150323_001506	It's enticing, but...
QUEST_20150323_001507	Do you have a written letter of Horacius? 
QUEST_20150323_001508	No wonder! Here you go.
QUEST_20150323_001509	I can't just give my precious farming tools to someone so suspicious!
QUEST_20150323_001510	Huh? Why should I trust you? 
QUEST_20150323_001511	You're very persistent. Here.
QUEST_20150323_001512	I wonder how well the preparations are going.
QUEST_20150323_001513	Go away.
QUEST_20150323_001514	Can't you see I'm busy? Go away. 
QUEST_20150323_001515	So what? 
QUEST_20150323_001516	I'll actively cooperate.
QUEST_20150323_001517	Our rebellion will be successful. We can't be exploited like this any more.
QUEST_20150323_001518	Ah, really? Then I should give.
QUEST_20150323_001519	The exploitation became too much at some point... There's no generosity any more.
QUEST_20150323_001520	Then give us some silver.
QUEST_20150323_001521	Here you go. Use it well. Everyone, cheer up!
QUEST_20150323_001522	What do you want?
QUEST_20150323_001523	Someone's even more pathetic than me...
QUEST_20150323_001524	Beats me. I'll just give it to you.
QUEST_20150323_001525	What are they talking about? The baron is hiding something...?
QUEST_20150323_001526	There is no such thing as a rest day for a farmer. 
QUEST_20150323_001527	I'm busy. Come back later.
QUEST_20150323_001528	Don't bother me.
QUEST_20150323_001529	Then, I will sign the petition if you pay 10,000 silver.
QUEST_20150323_001530	I've never met anyone as generous as you! So kind! Hahaha! Take this!
QUEST_20150323_001531	What a penniless bum. Go away.
QUEST_20150323_001532	That's some persistence you've got. Fine. I don't really trust you but I'll sign for Horacius' sake.
QUEST_20150323_001533	Oh, it's you... Hmm, the petition of Horacius... finally! The day of Rebellion is coming. I'll sign it.
QUEST_20150323_001534	Did you put the tools to good use last time? A petition? Sure, I'll sign it. For victory!
QUEST_20150323_001535	Let me read the details of the petition.
QUEST_20150323_001536	Oh, alright. Here, let me sign.
QUEST_20150323_001537	How can I trust someone who does not trust me? 
QUEST_20150323_001538	What is it? Are you a fraud? 
QUEST_20150323_001539	You're persistent... Here's my signature.
QUEST_20150323_001540	Later. I'm busy right now.
QUEST_20150323_001541	Rebellion or not, life itself is not easy for me... Give me something if you want to say things like that. 
QUEST_20150323_001542	Oh, thank you. Here's my signature. 
QUEST_20150323_001543	How stingy. I'll have to be stingy as well then.
QUEST_20150323_001544	Tsk, tsk. You're as cheap as I am.
QUEST_20150323_001545	Sigh... Okay. I can't do that. Here's the signature. 
QUEST_20150323_001546	I'm very busy right now so come back later.
QUEST_20150323_001547	My signature for the petition? You think I'd just give it to you? No. At least pay me for it or something...
QUEST_20150323_001548	Aha, now we're talking. Let me sign that. For the rebellion!
QUEST_20150323_001549	Is this a joke...
QUEST_20150323_001550	What kind of big plan could a bum come up with?
QUEST_20150323_001551	You've got some persistence. Here's my signature. 
QUEST_20150323_001552	I can't just take a break from farming. I'm busy right now.
QUEST_20150323_001553	Do you have around 15,000 silver? Show some sincerity...
QUEST_20150323_001554	Wow, thank you. My signature is all yours. Horacius really does good work!
QUEST_20150323_001555	Then I'm busy too.
QUEST_20150323_001556	Even if you're busy, you should take care of yourself. You're broke.
QUEST_20150323_001557	I'll just do it for Horacius' sake. 
QUEST_20150323_001558	Come back later. I'm resting.
QUEST_20150323_001559	The plan of Horacius? You must be talking about that thing. I knew this day would come. I'll definitely give you my signature. 
QUEST_20150323_001560	I am just waiting for the day of the rebellion.
QUEST_20150323_001561	I don't even have enough money for my sick family... I don't care about the rebellion!
QUEST_20150323_001562	Oh my, thank you! I'll definitely be joining the rebellion. 
QUEST_20150323_001563	Someone, somewhere, is gulping down food while I don't even have money to feed my family... 
QUEST_20150323_001564	You and I are both poor. We can't think of anything else while we're starving.
QUEST_20150323_001565	Okay. I'll sign it so you'll stop bugging me.
QUEST_20150323_001566	I'm dizzy. Come back later.
QUEST_20150323_001567	Can we finally get to sleep in peace? If so, I'll gladly sign that!
QUEST_20150323_001568	I believe things will soon get better.
QUEST_20150323_001569	I just signed...

QUEST_20150323_001576	Men under the command of the Baron have been here, though they weren't able to make it back. {nl}I watched everything with the wizard's eyes. {nl}Even the screams of Vakarine and her Kupoles.
QUEST_20150323_001577	That depends on whether or not you have the will to save the goddess. {nl}We can take time to talk about it. 
QUEST_20150323_001578	The limbs of Nuaele were all cut off. {nl}Now go find Aldona. {nl}She will take you and Hauberk to Nuaele's territory.

QUEST_20150323_001580	Once Nuaele is gone, we'll be able to fight the demons easily- even with only the Kupoles. 
QUEST_20150323_001581	Our biggest problem aside from the corruption breach was Nuaele. {nl}Now we can focus on the former. {nl}Go to Prison District 3. The goddess awaits your support.
QUEST_20150323_001582	Keep your guard up. {nl}This may be the secret to the last key, but the demons are still watching.
QUEST_20150323_001583	You will enter a special room once you get all five keys of Maven. {nl}In there, you will be tested to see if you're eligible for the revelation.
QUEST_20150323_001584	The number of candles is important. But for this secret, you must remember the order of the candles as well. {nl}It is similar to the first secret.
QUEST_20150323_001585	The device is operating.
QUEST_20150323_001586	A few manic farmers assaulted the people. 
QUEST_20150323_001587	Guards are working hard to protect the farm. {nl}Help them. 
QUEST_20150323_001588	I thank you again in the name of fate. {nl}From here on, I will follow the stars to find Goddess Ausrine.
QUEST_20150323_001589	Thanks to you, the seal of Uskis Arable Land is now stable. {nl}However, many other Revelators have lost their consciousness to the evil energy at the Spring Light Woods.
QUEST_20150323_001590	This most glorious Great Cathedral was built 660 years ago under the guide of Archbishop Silvestro Maven.
QUEST_20150323_001591	I can still hear it. {nl}The priests' prayers filling the kingdom. {nl}The endless march of pilgrims coming for the grace of the goddess.
QUEST_20150323_001592	It was like that until four years ago. {nl}Before the curse surrounded the Great Cathedral on Medzio Diena...
QUEST_20150323_001593	Candlestick
QUEST_20150323_001594	No candlesticks are lit. 
QUEST_20150323_001595	I buried Dallas. {nl}His death pains me so much.
QUEST_20150323_001596	More monsters! Run!
QUEST_20150323_001597	You were running so hard for me. {nl}Why don't you give me the key, kid? 
QUEST_20150323_001598	The breach of corruption, once open, will continue to expand. {nl}Revelator, please help Vakarine as soon as possible. 
QUEST_20150323_001599	There seems to be some reaction in the platform of benevolence. 
QUEST_20150323_001600	Bishop Ilam
QUEST_20150323_001601	Bishop Aurelius, who was ordained at a young age, soon took ill and lost his life.

QUEST_20150323_001603	Nature of the Curse
QUEST_20150323_001604	Gluttony, Wrath, Sloth...{nl}The nature of all curses that affect{nl}mankind is obsession.{nl}It makes the spirits of the dead prefer staying behind as opposed to going to the goddess. 
QUEST_20150323_001605	The difference is that it is the will of the dead that keeps the spirit behind {nl}while curses are forced upon by others onto you.
QUEST_20150323_001606	Naturally, priests learning the teachings of the goddess are not permitted to use it unless it's for experiments.
QUEST_20150323_001607	My Mission 1
QUEST_20150323_001608	Even if the Revelator gets the revelation in his hands, {nl}it's useless if it can't be protected.
QUEST_20150323_001609	The purpose of my secret is not only to protect the revelation from evil but also to prevent the greed of weak Revelators.
QUEST_20150323_001610	May you wander in the everlasting fog of the unknown if you recklessly approach without realizing my intentions.
QUEST_20150323_001611	My Mission 2
QUEST_20150323_001612	Those who challenge the Holy Mission won't just try to gently unravel the secret. {nl}Because of that, I had to plan many secrets and take measures against such barbaric actions.

QUEST_20150323_001618	On the day we prayed to the goddess that we would return, everyone cried tears of outrage. {nl}Our church will never succumb to the evil curse.
QUEST_20150323_001619	(There are many books left on the shelf. Which one shall we read?)
QUEST_20150323_001620	Dusty Book
QUEST_20150323_001621	(There is a dusty book with a memo on the chair. Which one shall we read?)
QUEST_20150323_001622	It was really dangerous a while ago. {nl}If you were any later, we would never have seen the third key.
QUEST_20150323_001623	If you use the symbol of spirits, you can see the area where spirits will be absorbed. {nl}Defeat the demons there and their evil force will be absorbed into the symbol.
QUEST_20150323_001624	Once the Symbol of Spiritual Power is charged, go to Veinika Altar. {nl}Insert the symbol in the Veinika altar and you will receive the third key of Maven.
QUEST_20150323_001625	The medicine should work.
QUEST_20150323_001626	The key is at Gaule Altar. {nl}I think you should leak that much information to Naktis' servants.
QUEST_20150323_001627	Of course, you'll need to use the transformation scroll before doing so. 
QUEST_20150323_001628	The secret supposedly unveils upon application of a holy force, {nl}but the trap will activate regardless if it detects an evil force.
QUEST_20150323_001629	The plan is to get the key after exhausting that trap using Naktis' servants.
QUEST_20150323_001630	Naktis' servants will be punished for prying on Maven's secret. {nl}Use that opportunity to get the key.
QUEST_20150323_001631	Even if the goddess condemns me for this... I will hold my head high,{nl} because it was for the protection of the revelation.
QUEST_20150323_001632	Did you find the last key?
QUEST_20150323_001633	This sanctuary is a treasure house of knowledge. {nl}You need to master the fundamentals of everything to protect the kingdom,{nl}and the revelation in the name of the goddess. 
QUEST_20150323_001634	Studying the demons is no exception.
QUEST_20150323_001635	The monarch of curses, Naktis... {nl}She has not shown herself yet, but I'm sure she's somewhere inside the sanctuary.
QUEST_20150323_001636	Perhaps she's waiting for us to get all the keys.
QUEST_20150323_001637	I am honored to be able to now guide you to the hidden room.
QUEST_20150323_001638	Focus on the colors of the orbs. {nl}You should insert the key in orbs of the same color.
QUEST_20150323_001639	Of course it is impossible to press down both footrests alone. {nl}You can use the wood chunks the demons scattered around... or ask colleagues for help. 
QUEST_20150323_001640	Coincidentally, I heard an eyewitness account from a refugee from this area. {nl}He asked for the safety of his family when I was being sent here... {nl}But I can't see any member of the Greene family, just refugees and monsters. 
QUEST_20150323_001641	And I found this mysterious seedling. {nl}Unlike others, we can feel a mysterious force from these. {nl}I can't identify this force in detail... {nl}But I'm sure it can purify evil.
QUEST_20150323_001642	We would have known better if Master was here. {nl}At any rate, we have to test if this seedling actually has the power to purify. {nl}I will do a simple purifying ritual. {nl}Get me some Ellom Leaves to grasp the pollution status of this area. 
QUEST_20150323_001643	Now, let's start. {nl}Please watch together. 
QUEST_20150323_001644	But he is a druid who has accomplished as much as I have. {nl}I think he can find out what the secret of this seedling is.
QUEST_20150323_001645	Also, you may experience something unusual if you have this twig. {nl}If you do, please tell him about it too.
QUEST_20150323_001646	Please find my colleague in Shaton Farm.
QUEST_20150323_001647	Aren't the dandelions around pretty? {nl}They disservice me, however, by sucking nutrients from the ground. {nl}If this continues, we won't be having a wheat harvest next season. {nl}Please remove the dandelions from the farm. 
QUEST_20150323_001648	Huh?
QUEST_20150323_001649	Huh?
QUEST_20150323_001650	Huh?
QUEST_20150323_001651	Huh? 
QUEST_20150323_001652	We're fighting hard. {nl}My mens' injuries are far more urgent than the farmers, wouldn't you agree? {nl}But some druid provided medicine only to the farmers which they then hid away. {nl}I have no words...
QUEST_20150323_001653	It's simple. I will look out for my men first. {nl}Bring me the medicine that they've hidden. It shouldn't be hard to find. {nl}Probably in some wooden box or grape wagon, possibly an empty house... Somewhere there.
QUEST_20150323_001654	But be careful. {nl}If this bowl fills with water, the spell will fume a special force. {nl}Then the monsters attracted to that force might attack. 
QUEST_20150323_001655	It was successful. {nl}Did you know these seeds are the same type as the mysterious seedlings? {nl}Seems like a wide range of land can be purified if it's grown well enough.
QUEST_20150323_001656	Growing these will use up parts of the cultivated farm however. {nl}The landlord of the farm in the reservoir area, Shaton, {nl}is here just in time so I should try persuading him while I can.
QUEST_20150323_001657	I'll meet you in the reservoir area. 
QUEST_20150323_001658	Soldier Mike
QUEST_20150323_001659	My parent passed away on Medzio Diena because of them. {nl}I applied as a soldier here for my parents' revenge. {nl}But... it's a shame. I can't even so much as look at them. {nl}Please, do me a favor and kill them for me!
QUEST_20150323_001660	They'll jump out when you approach the bush and more'll come out if you shake it. {nl}You're partly responsible for it so you should help.
QUEST_20150323_001661	There was a young couple that used to work here. They were very diligent. {nl}Everyone here did not work hard because they hated Shaton but they were different. 
QUEST_20150323_001662	But that Shaton abused and exploited them. {nl}They ended up dying of overwork. I have some of their keepsakes... {nl}I promised to bury it near the grave but I lost the bag I kept them in in the chaos of Medzio Diena. {nl}If you find an old bag, please check if there's a ring inside. 
QUEST_20150323_001663	Good. This potion cost me a fortune at the Fedimian Black Market. {nl}It was from an elementalist who seemed trustworthy, unlike those druids. {nl}According to him, this potion contains the essence of alchemy. 
QUEST_20150323_001664	He said if I pour this on the ground, a powerful obedient monster will appear. {nl}I'll use it to wipe out all the monsters in my farm!
QUEST_20150323_001665	Well, I've made some mistakes here and there but who doesn't? {nl}I mean, just look at grapes. How can you use water without wine mixed as drinking water? {nl}Even if the world is ending, you can't just drink plain water. That's barbaric! {nl}Hmm! Anyway, I appreciate the help. I'll listen to your story.
QUEST_20150323_001666	I'm just listening! I'm not going to do what you say! {nl}I don't think wheat will grow here no matter what kind of magic you use. {nl}I need to look for my son's body, so you better keep it short!
QUEST_20150323_001667	The wandering girl the farmers mentioned sounds suspicious. {nl}Elly agrees with me too. {nl}Looking at the facts together with her actions, we can't just dismiss her as an ordinary girl. {nl}Won't people in the Shaton family do anything about it? 
QUEST_20150323_001668	And Medzio Diena came a few years after. {nl}My family barely made it out alive and this is what happened to the farm. {nl}That's not all. {nl}It was mentioned that a blue disaster will follow the great disaster.
QUEST_20150323_001669	Think about it, it may have been a warning about those poisonous grapes. {nl}The true gold blessing will come after the blue disaster passes. I don't know what that means. {nl}I wanted to talk to her more but her father kicked her out saying she felt ominous. {nl}Where could she be wandering now...
QUEST_20150323_001670	Thank you. {nl}Maybe we earned some of the master's trust. {nl}If so, then it's all thanks to you. {nl}Good luck...
QUEST_20150323_001671	I heard things went well at the Shaton Farm. {nl}That's a relief. I will discuss with the master about the large-scale purification and how to make it successful.
QUEST_20150323_001672	Thank you. This will help many people recover.
QUEST_20150323_001673	It's a task of getting rid of the Lauzinutes across the underground tunnel. {nl}The owner's son disappeared in the underground tunnel long ago. It's creepy and I don't ever want to go in there.

QUEST_20150511_002008	Every object possess the inner strength of its possessor. {nl}And to add to the magical interpretations on that, they could also transform the shapes of their possessors. {nl}Objects belonging to demons could do it with relative ease.

QUEST_20150511_002009	But that's still just a theory despite the efforts of many frontiers. {nl}The possessor's inner strength and interpretations can never be fully understood if it were not for the possessor himself. {nl}That's why we hope for the blessing from the goddess or the wisdom from the possessor for the knowledge we lack.

QUEST_20150511_002012	We've finally arrived in front of the Zachariel's Royal Mausoleum. {nl}He was the first king of this kingdom and used an enormous number of people to build it. {nl}I believe only this place can answer the question I've had in my mind for a long time.
QUEST_20150511_002013	What was he trying to protect with this gigantic Royal Mausoleum? {nl}The answer must be inside, but the bleak atmosphere the interior exudes makes me hesitate to enter.
QUEST_20150511_002014	There's something inside the dark tomb.{nl}As I advanced inside, the large stone statues all turned to look down at me and then chased me out. {nl}I guess the great king in the past is still the great king in the present. {nl}I better investigate from the pillar outside of the Royal Mausoleum.
QUEST_20150511_002015	With the help from a young, kind historian, I was able to find a big clue. {nl}Yes. The best place to hide a tree is in a forest. {nl}Ruko Plateau and King's Plateau... I'm so close I can almost touch it. {nl}I'm confident the goddess sent him to me. May the blessing of the goddess always be with us!
QUEST_20150511_002016	Some pillars unlock the tomb{nl}and some altars lock it.{nl}The magical energy that surrounds{nl}the tomb moves by a key.{nl}But none among us can be that key. {nl}We were not Chosen.
QUEST_20150511_002017	The curse disturbs the rules of the universe that are being controlled by the goddess through human greed. {nl}These rules in the human world get influenced by the personalities of each person, their abilities and their potential power. {nl}The cases when these abilities get released depend on the conditions above.
QUEST_20150511_002018	According to the old writing left on the Great Cathedral, that is using a small part of the goddess' abilities secretly. {nl}Some people say that after seducing the weak minds of people, the demons used them for the source of the curse. {nl}May the goddess bless you!
QUEST_20150511_002019	There are two ways to release the curse: {nl}Remove the curse using a greater power or eliminate its caster. {nl}
QUEST_20150511_002020	Removing the curse using a greater power: {nl}This way depends on whether the power that overwhelms the curse comes from good or evil and from darkness or light.{nl}{nl}The most important factor for eliminating the caster: {nl}Even after eliminating the caster, the curse may not be removed due to other factors.{nl}{nl}I have no doubt that the power of the goddess is stronger.
QUEST_20150511_002021	There are mainly two ways to spread the curse. {nl}First, using equipment and uttering simple words. It sounds easy but it is, in fact, the hardest way. {nl}Therefore, from the example of the Pilgrim's Way, we mainly use the cursed ones as the mediums to spread the curse.
QUEST_20150511_002022	When a caster makes a curse, the caster has a tremendous influence on the mind of the victim. Their ego usually can't endure the feeling of guilt this causes. {nl}It seems the magic that was used on the cursed city of Ruklys is of a higher level than the one used on Naktis. We need to look into it more.

QUEST_20150714_002079	I don't want to die. {nl}We were just following the goddesses' words. {nl}Everyone is killing each other in the names of the goddesses. {nl}Who has deceived us? {nl}

QUEST_20150714_002081	The Royal Army needs competent people like you! {nl}Loyalty to the kingdom! To victory and a brighter future!
QUEST_20150714_002082	Pledge loyalty to the Royal Army and become a new and better person. {nl}The goddesses protect our armies.
QUEST_20150714_002083	Life and death... which one would you choose? {nl}The only way to survive is to swear loyalty to the kingdom!

QUEST_20150714_002087	You will need various tools when traveling. {nl}It's better to buy them in advance.
QUEST_20150714_002088	Goddess Laima... Actually, I don't know her that well. No one does, except for her priests. {nl}I heard she's the goddess of fate and foresight, but she has not once appeared before us.
QUEST_20150714_002089	I just remembered something while I was talking to you. {nl}Maybe Goddess Laima knew everything about the disaster beforehand.
QUEST_20150714_002090	I pray to Goddess Gabija everyday. It keeps the house warm. {nl}As you may already know, Goddess Gabija controls fire and since I'm a housewife, {nl}I am close to fire as well.
QUEST_20150714_002091	If you cleverly use the dry air that forms around areas of severe cold, {nl}you'd be able to freeze any object even in a desert. {nl}{nl}However, if you can't receive the blessing from the goddess, {nl}it won't be possible to make that kind of air.
QUEST_20150714_002092	The Records of the Master Himself
QUEST_20150714_002093	I've studied magic for a long time as a sorcerer. {nl}From the process, the advancement of sorcery can't be explained without relating with demons, {nl}and since they've fought against the goddesses, {nl}the field has been widened to the study of the goddesses as well.
QUEST_20150714_002094	While I was doing that, I learned of the field of accumulation. {nl}It's an empty field. The theory of the beginning and the end is a fantastic library,{nl}at the boundary of transcendency, all for one purpose.
QUEST_20150714_002095	Records about Disciple Laius
QUEST_20150714_002096	My other disciple, Laius, is clever and a fast learner but has an insatiable greed for knowledge. {nl}I am worried that he may fail the task. {nl}A scholar should always try to learn, but obsessing about it will make one walk the wrong path.
QUEST_20150714_002097	Despite that, Laius is a disciple I acknowledge. {nl}His passion towards me and knowledge is just being expressed in a wrong way.
QUEST_20150714_002098	I hope Laius realizes this himself. {nl}Since he is my disciple, I believe he can do it.
QUEST_20150714_002099	Records about Disciple Hones
QUEST_20150714_002100	Among my disciples, two of them followed me until my later years and,{nl}will be my successors after my death.
QUEST_20150714_002101	Hones, who is one of them, is lacking in scholarly intelligence. {nl}However, I am sure his faithfulness and efforts will help him follow my teachings.
QUEST_20150714_002102	Records of the Hidden Object
QUEST_20150714_002103	...I don't know whether I should thank the goddesses for this discovery or not. My greed for knowledge can ruin the world.
QUEST_20150714_002104	I can't sleep well for fear of my research results being spread by demon investigation. {nl}That's why I wish to pass the rest of the research to the one I can trust.
QUEST_20150714_002105	The Inheritance of the Master
QUEST_20150714_002106	As the priests and theologians know, Goddess Vibora is in charge of the library,{nl}where all records of the world are stored. I was able to check several records in that {nl}fantastic library after the research and long studying I can't tell anyone about at the moment. {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002107	From the many records of the goddess, I was only able to see a few. {nl}Nevertheless, the fact that I checked the existence of the records with the important facts {nl}was astonishing. {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002108	The record which I can use to find the whereabouts of all the goddesses... {nl}If one had such secret information, it would be possible to predict the goddesses' {nl}future locations by analyzing what they did in the past. {nl}Because of that, their future plans may be disturbed or put at risk. {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002109	This is more dangerous because, if the demons find out the truth, {nl}their desire for the library will grow and, if they do acquire that knowledge, {nl}the world will be swallowed by evil. That's why - {nl}

QUEST_20150714_002111	Disciple Hones' Memo
QUEST_20150714_002112	If you want to find the master's research, you have to find three spatial magic stones {nl}and activate the fusion device.
QUEST_20150714_002113	The Spatial Magic Gem of Contract is at the reception room. {nl}The monsters probably have the fragments. {nl}Collect all the fragments of the magical stones and go to the{nl}preserved magic field in the Grave of the Saints to restore them.
QUEST_20150714_002114	The Spatial Magic Gem of Offer is with the Templeshooter. {nl}The Wisdom Guiding Stone will help you find the hidden Templeshooter.
QUEST_20150714_002115	The Spatial Magic Gem of Promise can be found in Siaura Mine. {nl}Use the Soul Crystal on the monsters first to collect their Condensed Spite. {nl}With that, destroy the stones in Siaura Mine. {nl}Black Chasers will pursue from behind, avoid them and go to the end of the mine{nl}to find the magic gem.
QUEST_20150714_002116	When you find all three spatial magic gems, go to the fusion device again,{nl}and place the magic gems there. {nl}The path to the master's research will then open at the Laudi Tower.
QUEST_20150714_002117	Spirit
QUEST_20150714_002118	Please... save us from this horrible contract... {nl}Remove us from this... Contract of Enunciation...

QUEST_20150714_002121	The Pot of Silence is at Memum Corridor... {nl}I'm so... exhausted...
QUEST_20150714_002122	Where to start...
QUEST_20150714_002123	I was a disciple of Agailla Flurry when I was alive. {nl}I didn't have any magical abilities so I couldn't use magic.
QUEST_20150714_002124	That's why I survived Helgasercle's wrath. {nl}She must've thought she didn't have to kill me since I wasn't able to use magic.
QUEST_20150714_002125	I am confident I am better when it comes to theories than other disciples... {nl}That's why I studied magic. And in my studies, I learned of the magic stone of interaction.
QUEST_20150714_002126	I came here when Helgasercle attacked the Mage Tower. {nl}I thought that if I could use the magic stone of interaction, I'd be able to use magic.
QUEST_20150714_002127	But, Archon drove me away from the Mage Tower. {nl}Due to this disturbance, the magic stone activated defensive magic, linking my,{nl}and Archon's spirit to each other.
QUEST_20150714_002128	As a result, Archon was sealed and my body disappeared without a trace. {nl}We became shackled to each other.
QUEST_20150714_002129	I've been tied here for hundreds of years... {nl}Since I can't do anything with my astral body.
QUEST_20150714_002130	The bigger problem is that Archon was released as well. {nl}I lost the body, but Archon, who is a demon, is still alive.
QUEST_20150714_002131	Memorial Stone
QUEST_20150714_002132	By avoiding the eyes of Helgasercle, I was able to come here to continue my research. {nl}I needed to find a way. A way to reduce the power of demons and increase that magical power.
QUEST_20150714_002133	By my name, Valius, the one who walks the way of Linker, {nl}I swear that I will not surrender to the demons.
QUEST_20150714_002134	I've made many magical tools, but I wasn't able to repel the attacks of the demons. {nl}Without checking out the result, I close my eyes.
QUEST_20150714_002135	Records of Investigation
QUEST_20150714_002136	The basics of Linker magic are to find the common factors in each others' spirits. {nl}So it is impossible if the acceptor does not possess any magical abilities or bases. {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002137	I've completed the first stage magic stone. {nl}It still does not satisfy the previous objective of delivering the perfect magic,{nl}and magical power somewhat.{nl}But now, at last it is possible to accept Linker Magic even without magical ability.{nl}
QUEST_20150714_002138	Proposal
QUEST_20150714_002139	If a magician finds a way to share all his abilities and knowledge with another, {nl}then even those without magical abilities can become a strong magician,{nl}within a short period of time.
QUEST_20150714_002140	This way, you'd be able to hide from the eyes of Helgasercle,{nl}who is extremely afraid of the disciple of Agailla Flurry appearing.
QUEST_20150714_002141	However, I'm not sure if this is at all possible or whether or not it will have any side effects.
QUEST_20150714_002142	Design Proposal
QUEST_20150714_002143	The magic stone of the interaction can be made to work on the behalf of a Linker. {nl}However, maintaining the stone of interaction requires a considerable amount of magical power.
QUEST_20150714_002144	Hence, we decided to maintain the magic stone of the interaction {nl}with 12 regenerating magical power stones. {nl}If no problems arise, we will be able to maintain it, but if the magical power supply is cut, {nl}it won't last long.
QUEST_20150714_002145	Adrijus' Notice Board
QUEST_20150714_002146	I am looking for a stone rubbing of the tablet at the central sanctum. {nl}If you find any tablets with writings engraved, make a rubbing off of it. {nl}- Adrijus

QUEST_20150714_002148	It seems that someone has already made a rubbing since there is a vague trace of ink. {nl}Shall I read it?
QUEST_20150714_002149	King Kadumel finally dies.
QUEST_20150714_002150	Instead of the Mage Tower, the Tower of Fire would be a more fitting name for Flurry's tower.
QUEST_20150714_002151	This is a very secluded area so monsters usually prey around here. {nl}Be careful around here.
QUEST_20150714_002152	Research Records of Demetrius
QUEST_20150714_002153	In ancient times, humans lived with the goddesses. {nl}When I first heard of this piece of folklore, {nl}I thought it was made up out of respect for the goddesses. {nl}{nl}I started to investigate what historic background caused such reverence, {nl}as well as why this myth was created.
QUEST_20150714_002154	I increased the extent of my research. {nl}I traveled to many regions of the kingdom and collected similar cases. {nl}And I started to believe that this story was part of a bigger truth rather {nl}than just a small truth covered in fabrication.
QUEST_20150714_002155	The facts that we've discovered so far are thus: {nl}{nl}In the beginning, or a period not that far from the beginning, {nl}all humans used to live with the goddesses underground. {nl}I suppose the goddesses used to be more directly involved with humans. {nl}I have no idea why but soon, the humans left that place and scattered across the land.
QUEST_20150714_002156	This movement was made very naturally. {nl}If that hadn't been the case, then there must have been conflicts, {nl}and more fables would have been created as a result.
QUEST_20150714_002157	I believe the goddesses erased all memory and records of that time completely. {nl}However, we can't deny the possibility that another reason may exist {nl}due to the fact that this legend still remains despite the authority of the great goddesses.
QUEST_20150714_002158	And this is a very cautious prediction, but the creatures that we call demons{nl}may exist underground. {nl}{nl}Though that theory is hard to accept when we think about all the facts {nl}that are recorded in history and the present.
QUEST_20150714_002159	I can smell many Avietes. I heard they're effective... Could you share them with us?

QUEST_20150714_002167	I guess I'll take this tombstone rubbing to the person who wants it.
QUEST_20150714_002168	Since I've already made the rubbing, I'll give it to the person who wants it.

QUEST_20150714_002192	The Basics of Ignition
QUEST_20150714_002193	Ignition differs by elements, but with the blessing from the goddess, there may be cases where we can ignore that. {nl}To do so, we should try hard to achieve the scholarly knowledge and the faithfulness to the goddesses.

QUEST_20150729_002310	Aiste asked the elderly beggar, {nl}'Did you by any chance pick up the silver coins I dropped? Would you return them to me? I worked very hard everyday for those coins and really need them.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002311	The beggar was taken aback. Aiste was asking for the impossible. After all, finding dropped coins in Fedimian was unthinkable. {nl}The old beggar was about to explain this to Aiste but instead remarked, {nl}'I've also lost coins in this area. It would be nice if you looked for mine as you searched for yours.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002312	'Why don't you go to where you work and explain what happened to them? Make sure you look lost.' The beggar then hesitantly added, {nl}'In the meantime, I'll be looking for your silver coins here.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002313	And so he said, {nl}'Just as you've been able to pick up all my fruit, you should be able to find your lost money at Fedimian, so do not tell me to give you a second pay.' {nl}The orchard owner's cold words brought tears to the girl's eyes. {nl}The sight broke his heart, but even so, he did not want to give her any more money. {nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002314	He was soon overtaken by guilt and said, {nl}'If you really need that money, you should go to the silversmith's.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002315	The silversmith, after hearing Aiste's story, stated, {nl}'Even for children it is foolish to be so careless. How could you not know that all money that falls on Fedimian soil disappears, never to be found again?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002316	Aiste was surprised by what the silversmith said and grew sad. {nl}After a while she asked, {nl}'Then why is it that such a cruel thing happens?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002317	Even the silversmith did not know the true answer, so he improvised, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna must be taking them.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002318	Hearing those words, Aiste replied, {nl}'Then I will just have to go ask the goddess.' {nl}The silversmith was astounded and replied, {nl}'While you're at it, why don't you ask the goddess to return my silverware?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002319	An exhausted Aiste soon arrived at the Statue of Goddess Zemyna. {nl}She prostrated herself before it and prayed to the Goddess Statue represented, her head completely down. {nl}'Oh, goddess. Please return my lost silver coins.' {nl}Soon, while offering her prayers, Aiste could no longer hold in her sadness and she finally wept.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002320	How long did she pray crying? {nl}Suddenly, Aiste heard a voice addressed to her. {nl}'My child, have come to take back what you have lost?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002321	The goddess' voice was heard again. {nl}'Aiste, what your asking from me is not in a method I approve of. Where I reign there is no harvest nor fruits to those who do not work.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002322	'But I worked very hard today!'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002323	'I know. So instead, I will give you and the others a chance. Look under your feet.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002324	After a number of steps, Aiste thought about the silversmith, {nl}and, again, went to his house and knocked on his door. {nl}As if the silversmith was waiting for her return, he opened the door immediately and said. {nl}'I'm sorry. I regret sending you away like that. I'll give you some silver. {nl}This time, be careful not to drop any and get home safely.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002325	As the silversmith held out his silver coins, Aiste shook her head and said,{nl}'No thank you, the goddess returned all my coins. On top of that she gave me even more. {nl}I remembered you saying you had also lost silver, so I came to give you my extra coins. You don't need to give me yours.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002326	At first, the silversmith was skeptical about the coins being returned, {nl}so he was surprised when Aiste showed him genuine coins. After thinking for a while, the silversmith said, {nl}'Then how about this. You give me what you want while you accept what I was about to give you. {nl}Isn't that fair? On top of that I'll give you a pouch to carry your extra silver.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002327	After leaving the silversmith's house, {nl}Aiste suddenly remembered that the old beggar must still be looking for her lost coins and worried about him. {nl}On her way to the beggar, she met the orchard owner again. {nl}Upon seeing Aiste, the orchard owner was overjoyed. {nl}'I was looking for you. I'm sorry for sending you off earlier. As an apology, I'll give you your salary again. {nl}Please be careful not to lose it this time.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002328	The orchard owner took out a large amount of coins, more than what Aiste's salary was, and handed it to her. {nl}However, Aiste shook her head and said, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna already returned my money to me. The silversmith also helped me, so now I actually have too much. {nl}Here, take a look.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002329	Disregarding the amount Aiste had shown him, the orchard owner said, {nl}'Well, even so, I would be ashamed for not giving you my due, so please just take it.' {nl}After saying this, the orchard owner stuffed his coins into Aiste's bag and left. {nl}By the time Aiste could muster up the energy to call the orchard owner, he was too far away.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002330	She hesitated for a moment but then set her mind on the beggar. {nl}After a bit of walking, Aiste arrived at where they met. The old beggar spotted her first and hurried over to her. {nl}He showed her the silver coins he was clenching onto and said, 'Look! I found your lost silver.' {nl}Aiste received the beggar's silver and then showed the beggar her bag and said, {nl}'Look, I found your silver coins too.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002331	After that, Aiste also held out her bag and said, {nl}'This is a gift as thanks for looking for my silver. I was given this through Goddess Zemyna's grace.' {nl}Aiste then left before the Old Beggar could figure out how to reply.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002332	Over the jingling sound of gold, the old woman muttered. {nl}'If these two pieces of gold could ever marry, the baby gold would make me rich... but there's no life in these things...' {nl}Modestas heard those words, and decided to comment. {nl}'That gold won't make you rich by itself, so just put it into something worthwhile. {nl}Do you really think muttering at baby gold will do something?'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002333	The old woman spoke plainly, 'Why not? If this way bears fruit, it'll be safe and secure.' {nl}'That's ridiculous. You should do what I do and gamble.' {nl}The woman was incensed.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002334	'So, you think your betting ways are better?' {nl}'Why wouldn't I? There are moments where I could win or lose, but your way won't make any gold at all.' {nl}With Modestas' words, the old woman paused in thought. Finally, she said, {nl}'Then let's have a bet.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002335	The disturbing aura around her grew as soon as the offer reached Modestas' ears. He couldn't outright refuse. {nl}'What kind of bet?' {nl}'We'll see whether your way or my way will make us richer.' {nl}'And if I lose?'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002336	'Don't worry about that. You will win, and you will lose - That won't change. The rules are fixed.' {nl}'What do you mean by that?' {nl}'By taking my offer, you will fail once, and you will win once. No matter what happens.' {nl}'Well, yeah. Winning and losing is how gambling works.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002337	'No. No matter how unlucky it may seem, you will win your first gamble. {nl}And then, no matter how favorable life may seem, you will fail the next.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002338	Modestas was still confused by these strange words. {nl}'So, you're saying I'll win on every odd bet, and lose on every even one?' {nl}'Yes. It will be so. You will win coin, and then you won't. Is that not fair? {nl}One coin will be enough to succeed, no matter how many bets you make. That is my offer.' {nl}'You think I'll switch between winning and losing, huh?{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002339	With her hand to her chin, the old woman gave a puzzling response. {nl}'Three times each, should be enough. Return to me after you make six gambles. {nl}Naturally, if you don't have more coin after your sixth bet, I will win.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002340	Modestas seemed to tremble. 'How much should I earn, then?' {nl}'You start with one gold piece,' she replied, 'and when you return, show me all your gold pieces but that one. {nl}If you stretch that single piece to anything more, then you win. As for the time... you have one week.' {nl}'So, what do you get when I lose?' Modestas reminded her.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002341	'Well...' the old woman lingered, 'If you win, everyone will know about my gold - {nl}and you'll have the power of winning and losing. On the other hand...' {nl}''On the other hand...'?' Modestas said, tensely.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002342	'When I win, then after this, the friends you know will disappear every time you lose a bet.' {nl}Modestas was unnerved by the conditions set. He did not immediately object, but thought of the victory, {nl}and soon accepted. Modestas was, most of all, the kind of person who never backed down.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002343	Are you not busy? You seemed in a hurry on your horse before you passed by for a talk. You should stop worrying about me and go.' {nl} Sigfried, hearing Modestas' words, replied, {nl} 'I was busy, but I still have time to walk with you for another 10 minutes or so. This horse might not seem like much, but when it comes down to it he can go pretty fast.' {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002344	Seeing Sigfried not budge, Modestas tried again to persuade him, {nl} 'Wouldn't it be better to be early as opposed to be on time?' {nl} {nl} Hearing this, Sigfried became adamant, {nl} 'Do you not believe what I just said or are you willfully ignoring it all?' {nl} A disconcerted Modestas said, {nl} 'No, I didn't mean it like that......' {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002345	However, before Modestas could say any more, Sigfried said, 'If you don't believe me, why don't we have a bet?' {nl} {nl} Naturally, the words, 'Sure. What do you want to wager?' rose up in Modestas' throat.
QUEST_20150729_002346	Considering Modestas' habit, to simply not immediately accept a gamble took superhuman willpower from him. {nl} 'What... what kind of bet?' {nl} 'We were going to bet on whether my horse is fast or not.' {nl} Modestas desperately fought his inner gambler.
QUEST_20150729_002347	As soon as the bet started, Sigfried tried every method possible to command his horse to move. Despite his efforts it didn't move a single hoof at all.{nl}At the end, Sigfried repeatedly cursed its strange behavior. Realizing he'd be late to his appointment without a horse, he threw the reins to Modestas and sprinted away.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002348	As Sigfried disappeared, Modestas felt uncomfortable.
QUEST_20150729_002349	You, the young man with the horse, can you come over and help us for a bit?' {nl} Modestas had no idea what these soldiers needed help for, but since he could no longer ignore them, he decided to head over. {nl} Once Modestas arrived, one of the soldiers said, {nl} 'You came at just the right time. We would like you to referee a small gamble we're about to make here.' {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002350	What started as a small banter turned into a big argument, which finally grew to become a big money bet. The soldiers had already gathered their money and only had to decide the winner. Unfortunately, every goddess got equal votes and a winner couldn't be decided.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002351	Thus, the soldiers decided to settle the bet by calling the first person who passed by, asking him who he thought the best goddess is, and deciding the winner from there. The soldiers agreed that the first passer-by would symbolize the will of whatever goddess he supported. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002352	Since a big jackpot was on the line, the soldiers waited with bated breath for Modestas' answer. {nl}Knowing there was no right answer to the question, Modestas simply said aloud the name of his favorite goddess. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002353	When he did, the soldiers reacted strangely. {nl} There was supposed to be an ecstatic winner and disappointed losers, but nobody seemed joyful nor disappointed. Instead, everyone had a bewildered look on their faces. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002354	Modestas, perplexed by their reaction, asked for an explanation to which one of the soldiers answered, {nl}'We originally had votes for four goddesses but your choice isn't any of them, so now we have five goddesses.' {nl}Then the soldiers resumed their squabble about how to decide the winner. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002355	The mood began to deteriorate so Modestas wanted to leave them. {nl}When he was about to take off, the soldiers blocked his path and accused him.{nl}'It's your fault the argument heated up even more. You're not thinking of just leaving are you?'{nl}Intimidated by the irritated soldiers, Modestas dared not to escape. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002356	Knowing Modestas, he could not simply sit on the sidelines watching a big bet grow. Eventually, he became enticed to join.
QUEST_20150729_002357	Modestas, caught in the heat of the moment and ending up participating in the soldier's bet, finally remembered it was his turn to lose.{nl}But it was too late.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002358	If you think about it, even if it was his turn to lose, all it took for him to lose was one more vote for any of the goddesses he didn't choose. With the odds of the next person walking by supporting his goddess being against him, the probability of winning was low anyway.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002359	However, the victor was chosen unexpectedly. A commanding officer found the soldiers slacking, disciplined them and was about to lead them away. {nl}The soldiers, obeying the superior's command, were about to march off when they shrewdly asked him which goddess he favored. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002360	Someone approached Modestas who had been lying down hurt and helped him get back on his feet. He turned out to be one of the people standing on the side, the wagon owner. {nl}The man who helped Modestas uttered with relief, {nl}'I am glad you're not too hurt. Your horse also didn't hurt himself tripping over that pit.'{nl}Modestas noticed a well-hidden pit where he pointed. {nl}The wagon owner continued.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002361	'My horse became injured here and can no longer pull my wagon. It's just an empty wagon, but at any rate, it won't be going anywhere for a while. That's why I have a proposition. Won't you sell me your horse? I believe with a healthy horse pulling the wagon, even my injured horse can help pull it in some way.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002362	It was an unexpected suggestion, but Modestas had to ride the horse to quickly find and catch up to the soldiers. He immediately refused the offer.{nl}The wagon owner tried to explain there was no way his injured horse can pull the wagon alone but Modestas was not persuaded. After his repeated refusal, the wagon owner offered a new suggestion.{nl}'Then let's do this. What if you buy my wagon? I will sell it for cheap. Since my injured horse can't pull the wagon, it will be better off in your hands.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002363	Modestas, after saying he'll be back if he loses the bet, began to rein his horse when the old Alchemist let out an eerie cackle. This caught Modestas' attention, who turned around and looked at his person.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002364	And right before his eyes, the lead nugget prize let out a sparkle and in a moment clearly became gold. {nl} The old Alchemist now snickered, 'Now you owe me one gold nugget, be sure to bring it.' {nl} Modestas protested, but as much as he looked, what the old Alchemist now held was clearly no longer lead. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002365	This time, no matter what, I have to wage a bet against the world's richest, well maybe not the richest, but a wealthy man at the very least.'{nl}As soon as he uttered these words, his surroundings shook like an earthquake and a heavy, deep voice declared.{nl}'I am the richest in this region.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002366	Modestas scanned his surroundings but failed to find anyone. So he asked,{nl}'Who are you?'{nl}The heavy deep voice answered his question.{nl}'I am where you stand. In your tongue, I am called the mountain.'{nl}Modestas in disbelief, couldn't help but talk back.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002367	You are... the mountain?'{nl}'That is correct. I am the mountain, and just as you are looking for, the richest around here.'{nl}'You are the mountain? Well, no, even if you are the mountain, how can you claim to be the richest?'{nl}'I own much land for my sierra stretches far. Further in me I contain large valuable lodes.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002368	Even if the mountain's veins contained nothing but rocks, he thought he could end up owning a large quarry to dig out valuable stones. Instead, the mountain had paid an inadequate reward.{nl}When Modestas pointed it out, the mountain disagreed.{nl}'All you own are two horses and a wagon.'
QUEST_20150729_002369	Surely one must wage things of equal value. This boulder is worth as much as you own.'{nl}With that said, the mountain returned to his former self, never to deal with Modestas nor anyone else ever again. {nl}Modestas, in his desperate situation, had wasted his crucial chance to just win one big boulder.{nl}Despite his bad luck, he consoled himself knowing at least he had horses and a wagon to transport the boulder.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002370	In front of Modestas, who had been worrying, appeared a familiar figure. It was none other than the one who had started the bet, the suspicious old woman.{nl}The old woman asked Modestas.{nl}'How is it? Is it going well?'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002371	Modestas confessed he was far from making profits, instead being in debt, and he had wasted all his chances to win and only had his last, losing bet remaining.{nl}After listening to his story the old woman flatly added, {nl}'Since you only have one bet left, go ahead and make your last losing bet. Then all that's left for you to do is pay up your end of the bargain for losing the bet against me.'{nl}Modestas was a man who loved to gamble but he was not the type to throw a tantrum nor was he a sore loser.
QUEST_20150729_002372	'Since you are unsure how to transport this boulder you suddenly won, how about this? Normally, I wouldn't change the initial conditions, but as an amusement I will give you a suggestion. Why don't you use your last bet to see whether or not I can lift this boulder up into your wagon? Even if you lose, at least you can have this heavy boulder loaded on your wagon.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002373	Modestas who had nothing to lose, nodded his head to accept her proposal. But before he could consent to the bet, the old woman continued. {nl}'But I can't just give you such a favorable idea for free. Therefore I will add one more condition.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002374	When Modestas asked about the condition, the old woman answered.{nl}'You are to take the boulder, which I will load onto the wagon, to Klaipeda. Then, turn it into an object of value which everyone will recognize and esteem. If you are successful then the punishment for losing the bet against me will become void. Your friends will not disappear. Since you already lost the bet against me, although this is difficult, I will still give you one more chance. How about it?'{nl}Like always Modestas had no choice.
QUEST_20150729_002375	When the boulder was set in its proper place with the help of the soldiers, the Alchemist who had left returned with another person. The Alchemist had brought with him a famous Dievdirbys sculptor.{nl}To the famous Dievdirbys, the Alchemist suggested, {nl}'Why don't you sculpt a statue of a goddess using this boulder, on this central site of Klaipeda? If this boulder is changed into a statue of a goddess, then nobody in Klaipeda will be able to deny its significance. I think that will fulfill your promise to the old woman.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002376	That the old woman appeared before him, that the many bets occurred, that the mountain erupted a stone for material was the divine providence of the goddesses, argued Modestas, persuading everyone. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002377	Thus, the people decided to follow the words of Modestas, and Modestas relayed to the Dievdirbys the order to create the statue. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002378	When the statue was finally finished, the citizens of Klaipeda gathered, curious to know the identity of the goddess who had been raised in the center of their beloved city.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002379	The Dievdirbys who had sculpted the statue had already vanished deep into the Kateen Forest, so the citizens of Klaipeda repeatedly questioned Modestas for her name. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002380	Despite the numerous questions nobody received an answer from Modestas. {nl}At any rate, this is the story of how the Goddess Statue of Klaipeda came to be. Even now that statue stands in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002381	Since that time, whenever Modestas took on a wager, he always bet the same thing. The answer to the question of who the Statue of Klaipeda honored.{nl}To uncover the name of the goddess, numerous people challenged Modestas to a bet.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002382	But no matter the impossible odds, Modestas never lost a bet. Therefore nobody was able to win the answer from Modestas for years and time flew by.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002383	And, as he lay dying, Modestas revealed the secret to the Goddess Statue in his will. When all became clear, the one who orchestrated all of this was none other than the one whom all other goddesses stem from, Goddess Ausrine.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002384	In the end, Goddess Ausrine, in exchange for giving income and an interesting life full of mystery to a certain gambler from Klaipeda, gave the city of Klaipeda a beautiful Goddess Statue, and a tale to last for times to come.{nl} {nl}

QUEST_20151001_002483	It is so good to hear that the Crystal Mine is opening again soon. {nl}I'd thought the world would've collapsed soon. {nl}Let's see, which equipment do you want me to take a look at?
QUEST_20151001_002484	The Revelator who saved the Tenet Church... I'd like to fix your equipment for free,{nl}but that is going to be hard due to the current circumstances.
QUEST_20151001_002485	It is great that the Revelator took back the Crystal Mine back from the hands of the demons.{nl}We feel embarrassed since it should have been retaken by us.

QUEST_20151001_002492	I've heard about the Tenet Church. Isn't it great? {nl}The expectations of you are getting bigger at Klaipeda. You realize this, right?
QUEST_20151001_002493	I could not save all the people at the capital city on Medzio Diena. {nl}But, I heard some Revelator saved everyone at the Crystal Mine. It is very good indeed.
QUEST_20151001_002494	About the Tenet Church, I know those Watchers well.{nl}I wanted them to move to Klaipeda since the world is dangerous these days, {nl}but they told me they feel more comfortable at Gele Plateau.{nl}Everything turned out well because of you.

QUEST_20151001_002499	I've heard about what happened at the Crystal Mine.{nl}I am sure the Revelators are the ones sent by the goddesses.
QUEST_20151001_002500	We are happy to hear that the Tenet Church was taken back from the hands of the demons.{nl}But, we still have a long way to go. We feel ashamed that we couldn't actively participate.

QUEST_20151001_002502	Even though the goddesses aren't here, we have no doubts that we are going to win.{nl}The Revelator who protected the Tenet Church confirms that.
QUEST_20151001_002503	Everyone thought that the legend of Cunningham was just a story.{nl}But, since the Demon Lord at the Crystal Mine really appeared, who was that girl...
QUEST_20151001_002504	I've known the Paladin Master for a long time.{nl}He must have had some worries... You have done something great.
QUEST_20151001_002505	The Crystal Mine is the start of the ordeal.{nl}But, that is the sacred duty which you are responsible for.{nl}
QUEST_20151001_002506	When the great earth accepts the death and the stars in the sky draw the horizon...{nl}The seeker of truth who will stand on the line where births and deaths continue eternally.

QUEST_20151001_002508	Splendid. I've heard some Revelator defeated the Demon Lord.{nl}But, what was more surprising is that the legend of Cunningham is actually true.
QUEST_20151001_002509	I've pondered about many things since I heard that the Tenet Church was protected.{nl}All these disasters probably occurred for something way bigger than we could ever imagine...
QUEST_20151001_002510	I don't know who the Revelator is, {nl}but it's so great to hear that the Demon Lord at the Crystal Mine was defeated.{nl}Now, dreaming for a hope is not meaningless.
QUEST_20151001_002511	It was a good thing that the Tenet Church was protected,{nl}but I am more concerned about the well-being of the Paladin Master.{nl}On Medzio Diena, he focused on his recovery for a long time{nl}when he used the Divine Sphere in the capital.
QUEST_20151001_002512	I've heard the demons failed to occupy the Mage Tower because of the Revelator,{nl}who has appeared recently. But, if I was one of them, {nl}I would have prepared enough so that no one could try occupying the tower. {nl}Unlike what had happened to my family.
QUEST_20151001_002513	How dare a Demon Lord insult the teachings of Maven...{nl}Naktis has paid the price for it.
QUEST_20151001_002514	I have heard about the Revelator who drove out the demons from the Mage Tower.{nl}The Masters didn't do anything. Of course, I didn't do anything neither.
QUEST_20151001_002515	Everyone is just busy trying to survive after Medzio Diena, {nl}so they don't have time to think about going to the great cathedral.{nl}But everyone relies on the Great Cathedral. {nl}The Revelator completed a huge task.
QUEST_20151001_002516	I don't know who the Revelator is, but I could have saved Mage Tower better than the Revelator. {nl}Of course, my fees would have be met.
QUEST_20151001_002517	Even a person like me who goes after money, I know how important the Great Cathedral is.{nl}But, one thing that keeps my attention... The necklaces of the wise man, Maven. {nl}They are not in the hands of the demons right?
QUEST_20151001_002518	I came here by passing through rough winds and waves, {nl}while you've came here by going through the Thorny Vines Forest.{nl}You must be joking that you haven't found the goddesses. Seriously, how did you do that?
QUEST_20151001_002519	If the Mage Tower collapses, Fedimian won't be safe.{nl}The Demon Lord Helgasercle... the end of the obsession ends in such vain. 
QUEST_20151001_002520	Ever since the Revelators who dreamt of the goddesses appeared, {nl}the hands of the demons released them one by one.{nl}The same goes for the Great Cathedral. {nl}The proof that the Goddesses didn't abandon us is them.

QUEST_20151001_002522	A gigantic tree rose up from deep underground the capital city.{nl}The size of the tree was big enough that it couldn't even be compared against any mountain.{nl}As a result, many cities and towns were destroyed and many people lost their beloved ones.{nl}
QUEST_20151001_002523	But, the disaster did not end there.{nl}The evil energy started to surround the grounds and the monsters started to become feral. {nl}The demons started to attack.{nl}It was like an incurable disease, we didn't see any sign of recovery.

QUEST_20151016_002770	However, Premier Eminent didn't give a single hair about our resistance.{nl}It was all planned meticulously from the very beginning.{nl}Only to take over the Fortress of the Land...{nl}
QUEST_20151016_002771	We were swung around like idiots.{nl}The monarch becoming tyrannous, ordering Commander Ruklys to attack the hometown of Lydia Schaffen, and Lydia retaliating to our resistance because of it was all according to his plan.

QUEST_20151016_002775	Commander Ruklys said that he will go meet Lydia Schaffen for the last time.{nl}He said that as long as he sacrificed, we would be able to stop everything.

QUEST_20151016_002781	The Xth of X, Year 45X{nl}-{nl}Those soldiers seem only royal and experienced with its name.{nl}Even if the order came from their own monarch, do they even know who they are daring to fight?{nl}Do they not know what kind of person Ruklys is even after facing him?{nl}It seems that thing over their shoulder doesn't even contain brains.{nl}If not, the monarch of Kadumel was truly out of his mind.
QUEST_20151016_002782	264th day of the War{nl}-{nl}A friend who's acting as Ruklys' advisor told me that Kadumel is conspiring with a group of thieves to overturn the situation.{nl}To stop this, Ruklys with his chosen elite troops will leave the fortress in secret.{nl}Telling me to keep the secret at all costs, my friend had a very serious look on his face.{nl}
QUEST_20151016_002783	275th day of the War{nl}-{nl}After the secret mission, Ruklys' complexion didn't look too good.{nl}The plan seems to have succeeded with the words going around, but there's a worry that there might be some another problem.{nl}Their numbers and supplies of the Royal Army is far superior to ours, but there's no one to make use of the power and take control.{nl}In the long term, it seems certain that we will be victorious, but the the air between us seemed anxious.{nl}

QUEST_20151016_002786	325th day of the War{nl}-{nl}We cannot win...{nl}If we were to lose this war, the most regrettable thing would be that we won't be able to spread the words that Eminent that even the goddess won't be able to save, and that the world will still believe him as a chancellor who protect the kingdom.{nl}Not only does he use the monarch as a shield to carry out his evil deeds, but he also plants the fault on the monarch himself.{nl}
QUEST_20151016_002787	331st day of the War{nl}-{nl}No matter how this war ends, if given the chance, I want to kill the chancellor.{nl}If we emerge victorious, I will ask Ruklys to have me execute him, and if we fail, I will at least want to charge at his barricade and stab his chest with a blade; even if I die in the process.{nl}Eminent has started to take over the Earth Tower while leading the demons.{nl}As a human being, how dare he join forces with the demons...?

QUEST_20160224_003627	Book written in Runic Characters
QUEST_20160224_003628	This is a story about the nearly forgotten runic characters.{nl}Runic characters had been used since before the foundation of the kingdom by smaller northern tribes.{nl}Peculiarly, these people believed that the characters held magical powers.{nl}That's the reason why the northern people spent a long time to find those powers.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003629	Finally, a person was able to find the powers dwelling in the runic characters.{nl}They do not have any powers by themselves, but they are a channel for powers that can only be manifested through them...{nl}That was the secret behind the runic characters.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003630	He went straight to Goddess Saule and told her of the hidden powers of the runic characters, and the goddess rejoiced and blessed him.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003631	People came to call him a 'Rune Caster'.{nl}He became the first Rune Caster Master and fostered many more Rune Casters.{nl}He also created the Rune Stone so that the new Rune Casters would easily be able to use runic characters.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003632	One day, he vanished leaving only his Rune Stone behind.{nl}The Rune Stone he left behind has become a symbol of the way of the Rune Caster and has been passed down from master to master.
QUEST_20160224_003633	People often say that the goddesses are always with us.{nl}This is right not only in a spiritual sense but also a practical sense.{nl}That's because it symbolizes the fact that the goddesses are tending over us from their abodes.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003634	{nl}For instance, it is said that Goddess Vibora manages a massive library only permitted to the goddesses.{nl}This library is also the dwelling place of Goddess Vibora.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003635	{nl}Another example is the residence of Goddess Jurate which is rumored to be on a mysterious sea where human ships cannot reach.{nl}They say that a ship larger than most islands is the residence of Goddess Jurate.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003636	{nl}It is said that even Goddess Vakarine that goes around numerous locations has her own abode.{nl}Some say that there is a demon prison in a dimension that we do not know of, and that is the domain of Goddess Vakarine. {nl}But that is only one of the many locations that Goddess Vakarine visits.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003637	{nl}There are also legends that Goddess Laima has a palace deep underground where nobody knows of.{nl}There is no way to find it, it is also said that the Demon Goddess Giltine also resides there.
QUEST_20160224_003638	The Rune Stone...{nl}I haven't heard of that in a long time.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003639	In the past, I've met a person that was searching for the {nl}special powers hidden within the runic characters.{nl}He was filled with a pure passion for the task.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003640	He eventually found the hidden powers in the runic characters and became the first Rune Caster.{nl}A channel for power... The power of the runic characters was their {nl}ability to allow the casters to realized their strength through them.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003641	He crafted a Rune Stone to let others use the powers of the Rune Stone with easier access.{nl}Although his Rune Stone was nothing extraordinary, the following generations of {nl}Rune Caster Masters have carefully guarded his Rune Stone out of respect...{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003642	Unfortunately his Rune Stone was lost during the Petrified City incident.{nl}That is why the Rune Caster Master is still looking for his Rune Stone.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003643	The fact that you've come to me with knowledge of the Rune Stone... {nl}Perhaps it means that you were led here by its powers.
QUEST_20160224_003644	Yes. Although it is an old tale...{nl}I do have an idea of where the Rune Stone may be.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003645	The last place I sensed the Rune Stone was at the Royal Mausoleum.{nl}But that was a long time ago... I don't recall exactly where I sensed it.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003646	I remember the traveler that came to me asking for a blessing a few hundred years ago.{nl}He said that he had seen a mysterious stone with {nl}strange characters engraved on it near a waterfall.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003647	Unfortunately I was not able to know about what was occurring{nl}around the world after I had resolved to protect the revelation.{nl}Perhaps humans may know more about the whereabouts of the Rune Stone than I do.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003648	Yes. Maybe a human family that has survived for a long time such as the Jonas family...{nl}Someone that has eternal life like the Amjinas is sure to know something.
QUEST_20160224_003649	You mentioned 'Rune Stone', didn't you?{nl}Ah, could it be...{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003650	If you are talking about a stone with strange characters engraved on it, yes I do have one.{nl}I don't know how long it has been, but it has been in {nl}the possession of the Jonas family for generations.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003651	But it is treated as rubbish since there is no way of knowing what it is used for.{nl}Now I know it is Rune Stone thanks to you.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003652	Why are you searching for it though?
QUEST_20160224_003653	I see.{nl}It is useless in our hands, so we'll give it to you if you absolutely need it.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003654	No matter how valuable an object may be, {nl}it has to be in the hands of someone that needs it to be worth anything.
QUEST_20160224_003655	You've come here in search of the Rune Stone?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003656	I don't know where you've heard of it, but I do have one.{nl}I threw a tantrum when I was young to get it when {nl}it was gifted to the Winterspoon family long ago.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003657	Though, that's already a few hundred years ago.{nl}Now where did I put it...
QUEST_20160224_003658	Oh, as it happens, I have it right here.{nl}I have no use for it, so you may have it if you need it.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003659	It may have been destined for you since you are the first person {nl}to seek something that nobody wanted for hundreds of years.{nl}As a handler of time, I am thinking that perhaps it was a future promised in the past.
QUEST_20160224_003660	I can't seem to find where I've put it.{nl}I'll keep an eye out for it, so would you mind coming back later?
QUEST_20160224_003661	Do you mean the Rune Stone?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003662	I don't have anything like that...{nl}But I do have something that comes to mind.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003663	There is a place in West Siauliai Woods that cannot be accessed through ordinary means.{nl}I had faintly sensed a mysterious aura for a few hundred years...{nl}But I couldn't find a way to get there.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003664	Perhaps the item you are searching for may be there.{nl}How about taking a look if you know how to get there?
QUEST_20160224_003665	Do you know that there is a place in West Siauliai Woods {nl}that cannot be accessed by ordinary means?{nl}I had sensed a mysterious aura there for hundreds of years.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003666	I don't know how to get there, or what to expect to find there.{nl}You might be able to find something if you find a way to get there.
QUEST_20160224_003667	Rune Stone
QUEST_20160224_003668	(Unrecognizable characters are glowing.)
QUEST_20160224_003669	(It seems as if you require more Rune Stones.)
QUEST_20160224_003670	Something glowing seems to be embedded behind the tombstone.{nl}Take it out?
QUEST_20160224_003671	You can see many interesting things if you sit here.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003672	Not too long ago, a lady that seemed to be a mage came to ask something strange.{nl}I think she was looking for a stone engraved with characters that glow blue or something?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003673	I said I didn't know anything of the sort since I have never seen anything similar.{nl}She said something about going somewhere past Escanciu Village... I can't quite recall.
QUEST_20160224_003674	Rune Caster Master
QUEST_20160224_003675	Eh? Why am I sensing rune powers in you?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003676	Goodness! {nl}That is the Rune Stone of the first Rune Caster Master, isn't it?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003677	How did you manage to find it?{nl}I've been looking all over for it...{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003678	That Rune Stone... Could you give it to me, please?{nl}Although it may not mean too much to ordinary people, {nl}it means a lot to Rune Caster Masters.
QUEST_20160224_003679	Thank you so much.{nl}The Rune Stone of the first Rune Caster Master is finally back in {nl}the hands of Rune Casters after hundreds of years thanks to you.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003680	I don't know if it is sufficient as a reward, but let me teach you a little about runic characters.{nl}While extremely rare, there are some books written in runic characters.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003681	Perhaps if your magic is compatible with the runic characters...{nl}You may be able to become a Rune Caster.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003682	No, I am certain that you will be able to become a Rune Caster.{nl}I think that the will of the runic characters led you here to me.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003683	Rune Casters can cast powerful magic through Rune Stones.{nl}However, it does take a long time to gather the required magic.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003684	Oh... Have I been talking too much about Rune Casters?{nl}My bad, but thank you so much for finding the Rune Stone.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003685	Come back to me if you wish to become a Rune Caster.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003686	I don't know if you could call it a reward, but I will teach you some runic characters.{nl}Although quite rare, there are occasionally some books written in runic characters.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003687	You may be able to obtain important information from long ago.{nl}Not a bad deal, don't you agree?

QUEST_20160224_003703	After the day in which you humans call Medzio Diena...{nl}Goddess Zemyna has hidden herself from the human realm.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003704	The life of humans and the fertility of vegetation...{nl}Medzio Diena must have been a great woe for the goddess of fertility.
QUEST_20160224_003705	We Kupoles have asked for her presence as the humans are longing for her...{nl}But Goddess Zemyna is obstinately refusing to meet us.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003706	To make things worse, the demons have started to attack the Earth Tower.{nl}It has become hard to even request a meeting with her because of the attacks.
QUEST_20160224_003707	Revelator, please find Goddess Zemyna.{nl}Maybe you will be able to change the goddess' mind.
QUEST_20160224_003708	If it helps finding Goddess Zemyna...{nl}I'll tell you what I know about the Earth Tower.
QUEST_20160224_003709	Unfortunately, there is not much I can tell you about Goddess Zemyna.{nl}I am sorry.

QUEST_20160224_003711	Relic Collector
QUEST_20160224_003712	They say that there are many artifacts from unknown periods in the Earth Tower.{nl}If you find something, how about exchanging for something I have?
QUEST_20160224_003713	There is someone who will want what we have even if the world ends.{nl}Our job is to supply it if there is a demand for it.
QUEST_20160224_003714	There is almost nothing known about the Istora Ruins.{nl}The fact that they were discovered thanks to being pushed up after Medzio Diena is about it.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003715	Then some adventures came to know about the Earth Tower here.{nl}It won't even open unless you are a Revelator.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003716	That's why we're making a living selling various of items to Revelators.{nl}Since only Revelators can carry relics from inside the tower.
QUEST_20160224_003717	One thousand and two hundred years ago...{nl}This tower has been built by the remaining vestiges of an ancient era forgetten by humans.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003718	A long time ago, the humans that lived together with the goddesses...{nl}They created the tower out of desire for the goddesses.{nl}

QUEST_20160310_003737	At first we worked hard to help him save our hometown.{nl}But then Sarma's research started to feel somewhat strange.{nl}It seems like Sarma's research has little to do with getting the overgrown trees back to normal.{nl}The experiments are mostly done on monsters, not on trees, and I've even fallen unconscious during one experiment.{nl}
QUEST_20160310_003738	I suspect Sarma is doing this to cover up for something evil.{nl}Since I have no proof, there's really nothing I can do.{nl}I can't ask you to trust every single word of mine,{nl}but I at least want to know if my suspicions are correct or if I'm simply overthinking it.{nl}

QUEST_20160310_003740	Discarded Document
QUEST_20160310_003741	For the experiment, we collected juice and seeds from the fruits of the overgrown trees.{nl}We were lost in despair, but now we feel hope again.{nl}I only wish this research will bring back our town...
