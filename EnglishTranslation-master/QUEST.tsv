QUEST_20150317_000662	The ambiance terrified me, so I hid behind a wall and watched. {nl}Then suddenly, a scary demon rushed in.
QUEST_20150317_000663	Flurry... turned into a handful of ashes by illuminating a great light. {nl}Did that demon do something? {nl}I had no idea, even as a wizard apprentice.

QUEST_20150317_000672	The Pedigree of Magic

QUEST_20150317_000675	The research twisted previous notions of time and space, {nl}which were beyond the changes of the body, {nl}and the rules of physics and the elements progressed significantly.
QUEST_20150317_000676	The Report of the High Barrier Magic
QUEST_20150317_000677	The barrier in this tower could not have possibly been created by the Demon Lord alone.
QUEST_20150317_000678	It acts like a tight-knit net. {nl}Someone with a normal level of divine power cannot escape from it.
QUEST_20150317_000679	For what reason was this barrier created?{nl}Is it related to the fact that the goddess who controls the flames of this world is staying here?
QUEST_20150317_000680	Agailla Flurry called Gabija to this tower, so this barrier is not meant to lock Gabija in. {nl}To find out the reason for this, we first have to understand the composition of the barrier.
QUEST_20150317_000681	After a long investigation, we've found that this barrier was {nl}not only created with the power of Helgasercle, but rather blended with mana of different wavelengths.
QUEST_20150317_000682	We've also found that mana was composed by aligning the foundation stones in a certain position.
QUEST_20150317_000683	We were able to retrieve some of those foundation stones from various areas in the kingdom. {nl}The new information that we learned from them was astonishing.
QUEST_20150317_000684	The mana provided to use barrier magic wasn't voluntary. {nl}We theorize that the levels of the Demon Lords were divided and sealed into the foundation stones and aligned into a position.
QUEST_20150317_000685	The key to unlock this barrier is in the foundation. {nl}We'll continue to search for the answer after we block Helgasercle's invasion.
QUEST_20150317_000686	The Understanding of Mana
QUEST_20150317_000687	Unlike priests who control the blessing of the goddess directly, {nl}the wizard is defined as a person who releases various magic information or the blessing of the goddess.
QUEST_20150317_000688	Okay so, what is mana? {nl}We can say the true quality of mana is the life force on this land. {nl}The life force of nature. It doesn't just imply the length of lives.
QUEST_20150317_000689	The life force is a form of energy that composes this world and it spreads like branches to various places in the world. {nl}If you could find the source of that energy, you may obtain astonishing power.
QUEST_20150317_000690	The Diary of Antares' Investigation
QUEST_20150317_000691	As I was investigating mana, I discovered one important fact: {nl}The mana which flows steadily in the Mage Tower behaves strangely on the top of the tower
QUEST_20150317_000692	After lengthy research, I found out that there is a third type of energy which is {nl}different from the types of mana we know of, and it has a shape of a specific object.
QUEST_20150317_000693	This object must be from the era of Agailla Flurry as no one knows the existence of this object.
QUEST_20150317_000694	I am sure that this object will bring a new beginning of magic, {nl}but since it is separated at the highest place atop the tower, we have no way to reach it.
QUEST_20150317_000695	We can't demolish the tower nor destroy part of it just to get it.
QUEST_20150317_000696	I will end my writing by stating that this object has more to be investigated.

QUEST_20150317_001079	Revelation of Mage Tower
QUEST_20150317_001080	This is an old story of Fedimian before the Goddess Statue was built.
QUEST_20150317_001081	A long time ago, the people of Fedimian were quite normal, {nl}not much different from the ordinary people of the rest of the world. {nl}However, the people of Fedimian did differ from their worldly peers in one aspect.
QUEST_20150317_001082	The people of Fedimian were very cautious.{nl}In the sense that they take the word 'cautious' much more seriously. {nl}These people were as cautious around fire as they were without.
QUEST_20150317_001083	The Fedimians were modest about this with others. {nl}Even those who stayed at Fedimian for a while could not pick up the trait.
QUEST_20150317_001084	Thanks to this behavior, the people of Fedimian fared better during tough times, {nl}as they were able to sense danger coming.
QUEST_20150317_001085	Because of this, no few words were said about the cautiousness of the Fedimian people.
QUEST_20150317_001086	In Fedimian, if someone dropped money on the ground, it would be gone forever. {nl}In a world where money mostly consists of silver coins, {nl}only the creditors would know exactly how much money has been lost in this manner.
QUEST_20150317_001087	Why money disappears into the ground at Fedimian remains unknown. {nl}Some people believe the Goddess Zemyna absorbs any money that makes contact with her area. {nl}Most commoners, however, believe this was done to reduce the demand of silver coins from creditors.
QUEST_20150317_001088	By believing that the goddess herself takes the silver,{nl}the people found it pointless to try and dig it up in her grounds. {nl}The fact that you can offer silver coins at Fedimian as tribute to her reinforces this idea.
QUEST_20150317_001089	In any case, the fact that one could lose money by dropping it on Fedimian soil {nl}has made Fedimians very careful in handling their money.
QUEST_20150317_001090	However, as much as one tries to be careful, mistakes still happen. {nl}More so with the case of young girls. {nl}One day, it happened to a girl named Aiste.
QUEST_20150317_001091	Normally, when one drops silver coins on the ground, it would scatter about on the road, {nl}and then disappear without a trace. {nl}{nl}Fedimians usually curse their own carelessness and move on, {nl}but Aiste was different: she wondered why and how it happened.
QUEST_20150317_001092	To find out what happened, Aiste began inspecting the area she lost her coins at. {nl}In her search she came across a beggar beside the deep end of the canal.
QUEST_20150317_001093	Aiste asked the elderly beggar, {nl}'Did you by any chance pick up the silver coins I dropped? {nl}{nl}Would you return them to me?{nl}I worked very hard everyday for those coins and really need them.'
QUEST_20150317_001094	The beggar was taken aback. Aiste was asking for the impossible. {nl}After all, finding dropped coins in Fedimian was unthinkable. {nl}The old beggar was about to explain this to Aiste, but instead remarked, {nl}'I've also lost coins in this area. It would be nice if you looked for mine as you searched for yours.'
QUEST_20150317_001095	Almost immediately, the beggar felt guilty of the mocking words he blurted out. He apologized to Aiste.
QUEST_20150317_001096	Why don't you go to where you work and explain what happened to them? Make sure you look lost.' The beggar then hesitantly added, {nl}'In the meantime, I'll be looking for your silver coins here.'
QUEST_20150317_001097	Upon hearing the beggar's words, Aiste thanked the beggar, and went on to follow his advice. {nl}Through his selfless act, the beggar suddenly felt a revived sense of responsibility. He looked toward the silhouette of the leaving Aiste, his heart heavy and warm from this experience.
QUEST_20150317_001098	Aiste went to the orchards at the outskirts of Fedimian where she worked. {nl}While one could just pick fruit from the trees there, it was also important to take the fruit that fell on the ground.
QUEST_20150317_001099	Smaller hands worked better for picking fruits, so young children were often hired at the orchards. {nl}Some orchards took it a step further: hiring monkeys, whose hands were smaller than that of children, to pick fruit. Monkeys did work more effectively than children, but often ate the fruit they picked. Thus, most owners relied on hiring children.
QUEST_20150317_001100	Returning, Aiste visited the orchard she worked at and explained her situation to the orchard owner. {nl}Unfortunately, the owner was not in a good mood, having just had a quarrel with his wife. {nl}He, like all other Fedimians, knew about the phenomenon, and saw no reason to give Aiste more money.
QUEST_20150317_001101	And so he said, {nl}'Just as you've been able to pick up all my fruit, you should be able to find your lost money at Fedimian, so do not tell me to give you a second pay.' {nl}The orchard owner's cold words brought tears to the girl's eyes. {nl}The sight broke his heart, but even so, he did not want to give her any more money.
QUEST_20150317_001102	He was soon overtaken by guilt and said, {nl}'If you really need that money, you should go to the silversmith's.'
QUEST_20150317_001103	Aiste set towards the silversmith's place as soon as she heard those words. {nl}Fortunately, the house was located outside Fedimian walls. {nl}Had it been inside, the silversmith ran the risk of losing his money and silverware to the soil.
QUEST_20150317_001104	It is for this reason that he lives on the outskirts of Fedimian. {nl}Aiste knocked on the front door and explained her situation to him as soon as he answered.
QUEST_20150317_001105	The silversmith, after hearing Aiste's story, stated, {nl}'Even for children it is foolish to be so careless. How could you not know that all money that falls on Fedimian soil disappears, never to be found again?'
QUEST_20150317_001106	Aiste was surprised by what the silversmith said and grew sad. {nl}After a while she asked, {nl}'Then why is it that such a cruel thing happens?'
QUEST_20150317_001107	Even the silversmith did not know the true answer, so he improvised, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna must be taking them.'
QUEST_20150317_001108	Hearing those words, Aiste replied, {nl}'Then I will just have to go ask the goddess.' {nl}The silversmith was astounded and replied, {nl}'While you're at it, why don't you ask the goddess to return my silverware?'
QUEST_20150317_001109	The silversmith did not take to heart his own words, but Aiste did. {nl}She immediately set out to do as she said. The silversmith felt sorry for Aiste, {nl}but did not have the courage to call her back as she faded into the distance.
QUEST_20150317_001110	An exhausted Aiste soon arrived at Zemyna's Goddess Statue. {nl}She prostrated herself before it and prayed to the Goddess Statue, her head completely down. {nl}'Oh, Goddess. Please return my lost silver coins.' {nl}Soon, while offering her prayers, Aiste could no longer hold in her sadness and she finally wept.
QUEST_20150317_001111	How long did she pray crying? {nl}Suddenly, Aiste heard a voice addressed to her. {nl}'My child, have you come to take back what you have lost?'
QUEST_20150317_001112	Aiste knew in her heart that it was Goddess Zemyna that was addressing her. {nl}She stopped crying, cleared her voice and replied so.
QUEST_20150317_001113	The goddess' voice was heard again. {nl}'Aiste, what you're asking of me is not by a method I approve of. Where I reign there is no harvest nor fruits for those who do not work.'
QUEST_20150317_001114	But I worked very hard today!'
QUEST_20150317_001115	I know. So instead, I will give you and the others a chance. Look under your feet.'
QUEST_20150317_001116	The goddess' voice faded with those words, and Aiste found silver coins under her feet. {nl}She looked to where she had left her silvers and found that the tears she shed had transformed into coins.{nl}Aiste was very happy, and made sure to pick up all the silver before leaving.
QUEST_20150317_001117	After a number of steps, Aiste thought about the silversmith, {nl}and, again, went to his house and knocked on his door. {nl}As if the silversmith was waiting for her return, he opened the door immediately and said. {nl}'I'm sorry. I regret sending you away like that. I'll give you some silver. {nl}This time, be careful not to drop any and get home safely.'
QUEST_20150317_001118	As the silversmith held out his silver coins, Aiste shook her head and said,{nl}'No thank you, the goddess returned all my coins. On top of that, she gave me even more. {nl}I remembered you saying you had also lost silver, so I came to give you my extra coins. You don't need to give me yours.'
QUEST_20150317_001119	At first, the silversmith was skeptical about the coins being returned, {nl}so he was surprised when Aiste showed him genuine coins. After thinking for a while, the silversmith said, {nl}'Then how about this. You give me what you want while you accept what I was about to give you. {nl}Isn't that fair? On top of that I'll give you a pouch to carry your extra silver.'
QUEST_20150317_001120	Aiste obliged and gave her extra coins to the silversmith. {nl}After this, the silversmith gave Aiste a bag of coins.
QUEST_20150317_001121	After leaving the silversmith's house, {nl}Aiste suddenly remembered that the old beggar must still be looking for her lost coins and worried for him. {nl}On her way to the beggar, she met the orchard owner again. {nl}Upon seeing Aiste, the orchard owner was overjoyed. {nl}'I was looking for you. I'm sorry for sending you off earlier. As an apology, I'll give you your salary again. {nl}Please be careful not to lose it this time.'
QUEST_20150317_001122	The orchard owner took out a large amount of coins, more than what Aiste's salary was, and handed it to her. {nl}However, Aiste shook her head and said, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna already returned my money to me. The silversmith also helped me, so now I actually have too much. {nl}Here, take a look.'
QUEST_20150317_001123	Saying that, Aiste opened the bag of coins she got from the silversmith and showed the orchard owner. {nl}The orchard owner was extremely surprised, as the amount of money she got from the goddess and the silversmith surpassed the amount he had.
QUEST_20150317_001124	Disregarding the amount Aiste had shown him, the orchard owner said, {nl}'Well, even so, I would be ashamed for not giving you my due, so please just take it.' {nl}After saying this, the orchard owner stuffed his coins into Aiste's bag and left. {nl}By the time Aiste could muster up the energy to call the orchard owner, he was too far away.
QUEST_20150317_001125	She hesitated for a moment but then set her mind on the beggar. {nl}After a bit of walking, Aiste arrived at where they met. The old beggar spotted her first and hurried over to her. {nl}He showed her the silver coins he was clenching onto and said, 'Look! I found your lost silver.' {nl}Aiste received the beggar's silver and then showed the beggar her bag and said, {nl}'Look, I found your silver coins too.'
QUEST_20150317_001126	Even though the beggar was exhausted, he cupped his hands to get his coins back. {nl}Seeing this, Aiste was brought to the brink of tears. {nl}She wondered how much begging the beggar had to do to give her her coins back. {nl}With a heavy heart, Aiste gave the old beggar the coins.
QUEST_20150317_001127	After that, Aiste also held out her bag and said, {nl}'This is a gift as thanks for looking for my silver. I was given this through Goddess Zemyna's grace.' {nl}Aiste then left before the Old Beggar could figure out how to reply.
QUEST_20150317_001128	The beggar looked towards Aiste's distant shadow, and opened the present she gave him, {nl}curious to what was inside. Inside, he was surprised to find dozens of silver coins. {nl}Now he understood why Aiste was able to depart much more quickly than she arrived - she had lightened her load by giving him the excess.
QUEST_20150317_001129	For a beggar who had been stingy over a single silver coin, the fact Aiste could simply give away several tens of times that amount moved him. {nl}The fact that Aiste, who had went off and solved the mystery of Fedimian, came back and gave him what she really didn't owe, made the beggar thankful.
QUEST_20150317_001130	The more he thought, the less the beggar was able to hold back his tears. {nl}As he cried, he noticed something odd - every shining teardrop that touched the ground transformed to silver coins.
QUEST_20150317_001131	The beggar could not believe his eyes, but quickly remembered Aiste words about a blessing from the goddess. {nl}After a while, the beggar stopped crying, and went to pick up the coins and put them in the bag Aiste gave him.
QUEST_20150317_001132	A few days later, the beggar went to the statue that Aiste prayed to. There, he took out one coin from the bag to keep, and offered the rest to the Goddess Statue. {nl}He then prayed to the goddess whole-heartedly and left. As the money he offered disappeared, the beggar again to shed tears, but that's another story.
QUEST_20150317_001133	After a few days, an odd rumor spread across Fedimian. {nl}The rumor claimed that silver no longer disappeared into Fedimian soil. {nl}The rumor did not sit well at first with older, experienced people, but some tested the rumor with a paltry amount of silver, {nl}and it turned out to be true. Everyone agreed that finally, the mysterious phenomenon of Fedimian has come to an end.
QUEST_20150317_001134	After some time, word of this occurrence reached the king. Curious as to why this happened, the king ordered an investigation. {nl}The hidden truth was brought to light, and Aiste's story was known.
QUEST_20150317_001135	The king praised the people that caused the miracle with their charitable hearts. {nl}Additionally, to honor the grace of the goddess, he decided to spend the national treasury to build a large statue dedicated to her.
QUEST_20150317_001136	On the day the statue was finally completed, {nl}something miraculous happened as the King and Aiste went together to make the first offering. {nl}From the circumference of the statue sprouted coins - all the silver coins that had been lost by Fedimians up until that time.
QUEST_20150317_001137	After heated debate, the Fedimian people decided to not to hoard their lost silver coins. {nl}Instead, they asked the king to collect all the coins and distribute them among the poor of the Kingdom. {nl}The king readily agreed, and gave the order to record this beautiful event into the history of the Kingdom.
QUEST_20150317_001138	Even now, nobody knows when and how the mysterious phenomenon of Fedimian started, {nl}but everybody knows when, how, and who helped unravel the mystery. {nl}It was through the kindness of Aiste and the people who helped her, as well as through the grace of the goddess, that the mystery came to an end.
QUEST_20150317_001139	The Gambler of Klaipeda
QUEST_20150317_001140	The Gambler of Klaipeda {nl}~A Short Story~
QUEST_20150317_001141	{nl}{nl}In the town of Klaipeda, there once lived a man by the name of Modestas. {nl}He was a good, honest man - but had one major flaw that his friends and family all worried about, his wife especially so. {nl}Modestas was not lazy nor very clever nor not too foolish. {nl}He did not drink or repeatedly get into fights. {nl}The man had one flaw, and it was that he loved to gamble.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001142	During the day, Modestas would work hard and would never let himself go hungry - {nl}but whenever he earned more than he really needed, he would gamble. {nl}The wife would always try to save this money, but not one extra coin would ever go toward their home.
QUEST_20150317_001143	Whenever she could, Modestas' wife would often go to the shrine, and pray to the goddess' likeness. {nl}But Modestas continued his odd habits, and the people around him grew increasingly concerned. {nl}After all, the mind of a gambler would think, 'Today it may be small, but tomorrow it could be big!' {nl}And so the days rolled by, same as they ever were, until one peculiar day.
QUEST_20150317_001144	Like most of his days, Modestas was heading home after gambling away his excess coins. {nl}He was walking through the Siauliai Woods on the path to Klaipeda, when he saw a strange, old woman on the road.
QUEST_20150317_001145	This old woman seemed not only old and frail, but had an unnerving aura around her. {nl}She was acting strangely, as if deep in thought or as if she was obsessed with whatever she was doing. {nl}Modestas thought about simply ignoring the woman and walking past. Nothing would have happened if he did that, {nl}but curiosity got the better of him.
QUEST_20150317_001146	To be precise, what really turned his head toward the old woman was what she held in her hands. {nl}Gold. The woman seemed to be obsessing over two gold pieces, doing something with them. {nl}Unable to hear her mumbling, Modestas drew closer to the strange woman.
QUEST_20150317_001147	Over the jingling sound of gold, the old woman muttered. {nl}'If these two pieces of gold could ever marry, the baby gold would make me rich... but there's no life in these things...' {nl}Modestas heard those words, and decided to comment. {nl}'That gold won't make you rich by itself, so just put it into something worthwhile. {nl}Do you really think muttering at gold will do something?'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001148	The old woman spoke plainly, 'Why not? If it works, this'll certainly be the most pleasant, risk-free way to wealth.' {nl}'That's ridiculous. You should do what I do and gamble.' {nl}The woman was incensed.
QUEST_20150317_001149	'So, you think your betting ways are better?' {nl}'Why wouldn't I? There are moments where I could win or lose, but your way won't make any gold at all.' {nl}With Modestas' words, the old woman paused in thought. Finally, she said, {nl}'Then let's have a bet.'
QUEST_20150317_001150	The disturbing aura around her grew as soon as the offer reached Modestas' ears. He couldn't outright refuse. {nl}'What kind of bet?' {nl}'We'll see whether your way or my way will make us richer.' {nl}'And if I lose?'
QUEST_20150317_001151	'Don't worry about that. You will win, and you will lose - that won't change. The rules are fixed.' {nl}'What do you mean by that?' {nl}'By taking my offer, you will fail once, and you will win once. No matter what happens.' {nl}'Well, yeah. Winning and losing is how gambling works.'
QUEST_20150317_001152	'No. No matter how unlucky things may seem, you will win your first gamble. {nl}And then, no matter how favorable life may seem, you will fail the next.'
QUEST_20150317_001153	Modestas was still confused by these strange words. {nl}'So, you're saying I'll win on every odd bet, and lose on every even one?' {nl}'Yes. It will be so. You will win some, and then you won't. Is that not fair? {nl}One coin will be enough to succeed, no matter how many bets you make. That is my offer.' {nl}'You think I'll switch between winning and losing, huh?'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001154	With her hand to her chin, the old woman gave a puzzling response. {nl}'Three times each should be enough. Return to me after you make six gambles. {nl}Naturally, if you don't have more coin after your sixth bet, I will win.'
QUEST_20150317_001155	Modestas seemed to tremble. 'How much should I earn, then?' {nl}'You'll start with one gold piece,' she replied, 'and when you return, show me all your gold pieces but that one. {nl}If you stretch that single piece to anything more, then you win. As for time... you have one week.' {nl}'So, what do you get when I lose?' Modestas reminded her.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001156	'Well...' the old woman lingered, 'If you win, everyone will know about my gold - {nl}and you'll have the power of winning and losing. On the other hand...' {nl}''On the other hand...'?' Modestas said, tensely.
QUEST_20150317_001157	'After I win, the friends you know will disappear every time you lose a bet.' {nl}Modestas was unnerved by the conditions set. He did not immediately object; instead, he thought of victory, {nl}and soon accepted. Modestas was, most of all, the kind of person who never backed down.
QUEST_20150317_001158	As Modestas and the old woman parted ways, he, in any case, knew he now had a dangerous power guaranteeing his victory at any time in the near future. {nl}He walked, looking for the next person to bet huge on. As he wondered how much to wager on his next move, he heard the sound of galloping behind him.
QUEST_20150317_001159	Modestas turned around. It was his good old friend, Sigfried, riding on horseback towards him. {nl}They knew each other well, as both had been together through the highs and lows of gambling. They exchanged greetings and talked about where they were going. Sigfried dismounted to walk at a leisurely pace with his friend, idly chatting along their way. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001160	However, before long, Modestas could no longer continue walking with Sigfried. {nl}He was fully aware of his deadline, and had no time for such trivial activities. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001161	Even during their normal everyday conversations, Modestas and Sigfried unconsciously made big and small bets. Eventually, one would utter the word, 'Bet?' unconsciously. {nl}Neither of them were rich so these bets weren't ever that significant. Knowing this would trigger the curse, Modestas really wanted to ask Sigfried to leave. {nl}In the end, Modestas uttered these words: {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001162	'Are you not busy? You seemed to be in a hurry on your horse before you passed by for a talk. You should stop worrying about me and go.' {nl}Sigfried, hearing Modestas' words, replied, {nl} 'I was busy, but I still have time to walk with you for another ten minutes or so. This horse might not look like much, but when it comes down to it, he can go pretty fast.' {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001163	Seeing Sigfried not budge, Modestas tried again to persuade him, {nl}'Wouldn't it be better to be early as opposed to be on time?' {nl}{nl}Hearing this, Sigfried became adamant, {nl}'Do you not believe what I just said, or are you willfully ignoring it all?' {nl}A disconcerted Modestas said, {nl}'No, I didn't mean it like that...' {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001164	However, before Modestas could say any more, Sigfried said, 'If you don't believe me, why don't we have a bet?' {nl}{nl}Naturally, the words, 'Sure. What do you want to wager?' rose up in Modestas' throat.
QUEST_20150317_001165	Considering Modestas' habit, to not immediately accept a gamble took superhuman willpower from him. {nl}'What... What kind of bet?' {nl}'We're going to bet on whether my horse is fast or not.' {nl}Modestas desperately fought against his inner gambler.
QUEST_20150317_001166	On the other hand, Sigfried was understandably confident, knowing with certainty that he would win the gamble, and was alright with betting his horse. {nl}With only a little money at hand, the bet became too good to refuse, and Modestas finally accepted. {nl}And, as expected, Modestas won. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001167	As soon as the bet started, Sigfried tried every method possible to command his horse to move. Despite his efforts, it didn't move a single hoof at all.{nl}At the end, Sigfried repeatedly cursed its strange behavior. Realizing he'd be late to his appointment without a horse, he threw the reins to Modestas and sprinted away.{nl}As Sigfried disappeared, Modestas felt uncomfortable.
QUEST_20150317_001168	For Modestas, who had always been elated upon winning bets and depressed upon losing them, to win and feel depressed was a first in his entire life. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001169	Knowing he had just deceived his long-time gambling friend, Sigfried, and also missed an opportunity to earn a lot of money, Modestas felt conflicted as he walked slowly alongside the horse he had just won. {nl}While walking, Modestas remembered the earlier warnings of his unconditional bet. He realized that now, with his upcoming defeat, he was doomed to not earn any more silver than he started with.
QUEST_20150317_001170	While walking along the road, Modestas encountered a group of soldiers. {nl}Upon looking closer, the soldiers seemed to be arguing about what to buy at a store. {nl}Modestas decided not to interfere and pass them, but the soldiers noticed him and called. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001171	'You, the young man with the horse, can you come over and help us for a bit?' {nl}Modestas had no idea what these soldiers needed help for, but since he could no longer ignore them, he decided to head over. {nl}Once Modestas arrived, one of the soldiers said, {nl}'You came at just the right time. We would like you to referee a small gamble we're about to make here.' {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001172	Modestas was surprised when he heard the word, 'gamble', but was relieved to know he was only being asked to referee. After all, nothing could possibly happen if he was just refereeing. {nl}Modestas learned that the soldiers were fighting over which goddess was the best. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001173	What started as trivial banter turned into a big argument, which finally grew to become a big money bet. The soldiers had already gathered their money and only had to decide the winner. Unfortunately, every goddess got equal votes and a winner couldn't be decided.{nl}Thus, the soldiers decided to settle the bet by calling the first person who passed by, asking him who he thought the best goddess is, and deciding the winner from there. The soldiers agreed that the first passer-by would symbolize the will of whatever goddess he favored. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001174	The soldiers did not tell Modestas who voted for which goddess, for fear of his decision being affected by the expressions of each individual soldier. {nl}The soldiers did tell him however, how much they have each wagered. Just by seeing the gold nuggets, he could easily figure that there was a large amount of money in this bet. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001175	Since a big jackpot was on the line, the soldiers waited with bated breath for Modestas' answer. {nl}Knowing there was no right answer to the question, Modestas simply said aloud the name of his own favorite goddess. {nl}When he did, the soldiers reacted strangely. {nl}There was supposed to be an ecstatic winner and disappointed losers, but nobody seemed joyful nor disappointed. Instead, everyone had a bewildered look on their faces. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001176	Modestas, perplexed by their reaction, asked for an explanation to which one of the soldiers answered, {nl}'We originally had votes for four goddesses but your choice isn't any of them, so now we have five goddesses.' {nl}The soldiers then resumed their squabble about how to decide the winner. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001177	The mood began to deteriorate so Modestas wanted to leave. {nl}When he was about to take off, the soldiers blocked his path and accused him. {nl}'It's your fault the argument heated up even more. You're not thinking of just leaving are you?'{nl}Intimidated by the irritated soldiers, Modestas dared not to escape. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001178	In Modestas' mind, he concluded that the quarrelling soldiers didn't have him referee, but simply added him into the bet. In reality however, he had no real claim, so he wasn't in the bet just yet. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001179	Knowing Modestas, he could not simply sit on the sidelines watching a big bet grow. Eventually, he became enticed to join. Modestas, caught in the heat of the moment and ending up participating, finally remembered it was his turn to lose.{nl}But it was too late.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001180	In addition, because the other soldiers had already bet deeply, Modestas had to bet the only gold bullion he had. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001181	If you think about it, even if it was not his turn to lose, all it took for him do so was one more vote for any of the goddesses he didn't choose. With the odds of the next person walking by supporting his goddess being against him, the probability of winning was low anyway.{nl}{nl}However, the victor was chosen unexpectedly. An officer found the soldiers slacking, disciplined them and was about to lead them away. {nl}The soldiers, obeying the superior's command, were about to march off when they shrewdly asked him which goddess he favored. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001182	The officer inadvertently said the name of a goddess, and some of the soldiers began cheering. {nl}The officer, not knowing what was going on, simply ordered his soldiers to move along. In any case, Modestas certainly lost. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001183	Having now lost the gold bullion given to him by the strange old woman, Modestas was now at a loss. {nl}To originally intend to referee, only to end up losing all the gold he had, all while knowing exactly the reason why... Modestas felt heartbroken, dumbfounded, and yet, understanding. A unique feeling. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001184	Although Modestas had just lost money by entering a bet started by others, it was the first time he'd done so in his life. Modestas spent some time thinking of how to better his situation and {nl}suddenly got an idea, knowing he was certain to win his next bet. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001185	If he could call back the soldiers from earlier and bet his horse, he could certainly earn his gold back and possibly more. {nl}Knowing this, Modestas got on his horse, and sped in the direction the soldiers left towards. {nl}{nl}With speed, Modestas soon spotted a stationary wagon. Modestas lowered his speed to check out the wagon parked on the side of the road. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001186	Unfortunately, just as Modestas pulled up at the wagon, his horse suddenly grew agitated, forcing him off. Fortunately, because he had cut his speed and fell on muddy ground, he was not greatly injured. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001187	Someone approached Modestas who had been lying down, hurt, and helped him get back on his feet. He turned out to be one of the people standing on the side, the wagon owner. {nl}The man who helped Modestas uttered with relief, {nl}'I am glad you're not too hurt. Your horse also didn't hurt himself tripping over that pit.'{nl}Modestas noticed a well-hidden pit where he pointed. {nl}The wagon owner continued.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001188	'My horse became injured here and can no longer pull my wagon. It's just an empty wagon, but at any rate, it won't be going anywhere for a while. That's why I have a proposition. Won't you sell me your horse? I believe, with a healthy horse pulling the wagon, even my injured horse can help pull it in some way.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001189	It was an unexpected suggestion, but Modestas needed the horse to quickly find and catch up to the soldiers. He immediately refused the offer.{nl}The wagon owner tried to explain there was no way his injured horse can pull the wagon alone, but Modestas was not persuaded. After his repeated refusal, the wagon owner offered a new suggestion.{nl}'Then let's do this. What if you buy my wagon? I will sell it for cheap. Since my injured horse can't pull the wagon, it will be better off in your hands.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001190	Modestas could see that the wagon was very durable, good-looking and has been well cared for. However, he had no immediate need for a wagon, so he hesitated. {nl}In addition, Modestas had no money now; no matter how low the wagon owner went, he did not have the money to buy it. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001191	The human heart sure can be an amusing thing. {nl}Modestas, deciding the wagon was worth buying but lacking the money to do so, decided he could use his impending victory to win the wagon for free. {nl}So he proposed a bet with the wagon master, risking his own horse. {nl}Naturally, Modestas won. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001192	Modestas, having now just won a wagon and an injured horse, originally intended to keep just the wagon and his original horse. {nl}But seeing as the injured horse wasn't as injured as he thought, he believed he had won big. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001193	In his mind, now that he'd had obtained two horses and a wagon, he believed he was no longer in a bad situation, deciding this time to be very careful not to lose big next. {nl}So, instead of following the soldiers, he decided to go to a place where there was less people. He reined his horse and traveled away from civilization. {nl}However, even in a remote setting, he was bound to meet others. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001194	Rare as it would be, Modestas, while moving about in a uninhabited mountain, encountered an elderly Alchemist. {nl}The old Alchemist sat on a chair on the right side of the road, a silver nugget in hand. {nl}As Modestas passed by for a closer look, the nugget turned out to not be of silver, but of lead. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001195	'Could this Alchemist be one who could turn lead into gold?' thought Modestas, but soon thought he was just overestimating the Alchemist. {nl}But the Alchemist, glad to see someone pass by after a long time, called out to Modestas, and suddenly proposed a bet with him. Somehow, the whole world today seemed to want to make bets with Modestas, and he was getting tired of it. {nl}Modestas liked gambling, but to find opponents this easily was becoming a joke to him. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001196	Modestas was about to do something unlike his being and reject the bet, but the idea that he could wager low moved his mind. {nl}After all, the old Alchemist was wagering a lead nugget. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001197	Because he was certain to lose this time, Modestas believed it would be better to wager and lose against a lead nugget now than to run into people who would wager a large amount of money, and lose later. {nl}Modestas first made sure that he could accept the bet despite having no money at hand and could bring some later, and accepted the bet. No words need to be said about the result. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001199	However, right as the bet was settled, the lead nugget prize let out a sparkle and, in a moment, clearly became gold. {nl}The Old Alchemist now snickered, 'Now you owe me one gold nugget. Be sure to bring it.' {nl}Modestas protested, but as much as he looked, what the old Alchemist now held was clearly no longer lead. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001200	Instead, it was clearly gold, so in the end Modestas had bet and lost against a gold nugget. {nl}A now-tired Modestas ultimately had no way of objecting to the Alchemist. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001201	Now, Modestas had lost more gold than he owed the strange old woman. {nl}And now, he only had one unconditional victory and defeat left. {nl}As Modestas lead his wagon through the rest of the mountain path, he murmured about having to make sure his next win was a very big one. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001202	'This time, no matter what, I have to wage a bet against the world's richest - well maybe not the richest - but a wealthy man at the least.'{nl}As soon as he uttered these words, his surroundings shook like an earthquake and a heavy, deep voice declared.{nl}'I am the richest in this region.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001203	Modestas scanned his surroundings but failed to find anyone. So he asked,{nl}'Who are you?'{nl}The deep, heavy voice answered his question.{nl}'I am where you stand. In your tongue, I am called the mountain.'{nl}Modestas, in disbelief, couldn't help but talk back.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001204	You are... the mountain?'{nl}'That is correct. I am the mountain, and just as you are looking for, the richest around here.'{nl}'You are the mountain? Well, no, even if you are the mountain, how can you claim to be the richest?'{nl}'I own much land, for my sierra stretches far. Further in me, I contain large, valuable lodes.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001205	Hearing about the mountain's valuable lodes revived Modestas' habit. He even knew that this time, he was certain to win. Modestas started persuading the self-proclaiming mountain to make a bet with him. The mountain, unconcerned over winning or losing this bet, agreed. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001206	For a person to have a fateful encounter with a mysterious being like this, even Modestas doubted his own sanity. {nl}In any case, Modestas bet against the mountain's ores, and won.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001207	At the end of the bet, the mountain erupted, and a large boulder landed directly in front of Modestas. It was certainly something, but the boulder didn't seem to be what Modestas expected. For the mountain, this was the gambling debt repaid. {nl}In Modestas' eyes however, there should have been veins of gold, or at least something useful, like copper or coal. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001208	Even if the mountain's veins contained nothing but rocks, he thought he could end up owning a large quarry to dig out valuable stones. Instead, the mountain had paid an inadequate reward.{nl}When Modestas pointed it out, the mountain disagreed. {nl}'All you own are two horses and a wagon.'
QUEST_20150317_001209	'Surely one must wage things of equal value. This boulder is worth as much as you own.'{nl}With that said, the mountain returned to its former self, never to deal with Modestas nor anyone else ever again. {nl}Modestas, in his desperate situation, had wasted his crucial chance just to win one big boulder.{nl}Despite his bad luck, he consoled himself by knowing at least he had horses and a wagon to transport the boulder.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001210	And then suddenly, anxiety struck him. He realized that, although he has an unconditional loss upcoming, given the strange things that happened up to now, he would not be able to easily control the outcome of the final bet. {nl}Nonetheless, Modestas knew he couldn't stay where he was right now, and decided to leave. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001211	Modestas got up and tried to move the boulder, but to no avail. It was simply too large for him to handle by himself. {nl}He considered leaving it behind, but after recalling the mountain's saying that the boulder was worth more than his two horses and wagon combined, he believed that would be a waste. {nl}Supposing he could sell the boulder to a local quarry for a good amount of money, he became troubled and unable to leave. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001212	In front of Modestas, who had been worrying, appeared a familiar figure. It was none other than the one who had started the bet - the suspicious old woman.{nl}The old woman questioned Modestas.{nl}'How is it? Is it going well?'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001213	Modestas confessed he was far from making profits; instead he was in debt, wasted all his chances to win, and only had his last, losing bet remaining.{nl}After listening to his story the old woman responded flatly, {nl}'Since you only have one bet left, go ahead and make your last losing bet. Then all that's left for you to do is pay up your end of the bargain for losing the bet against me.'{nl}Modestas was a man who loved to gamble, but he was not the type to throw a tantrum, nor was he a sore loser.
QUEST_20150317_001214	Modestas knew these gambles were more than just about money. {nl}Modestas, a dedicated gambler, nodded along with the woman's words. He clearly looked to be a man with a huge burden, his facial expression dark. {nl}The old woman could sense Modestas' thoughts, so she made this proposal. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001215	'Since you are unsure how to transport this boulder you suddenly won, how about this? Normally, I wouldn't change the initial conditions, but for my amusement I will give you a suggestion. Why don't you use your last bet to see whether or not I can lift this boulder up into your wagon? Even if you lose, at least you can have this heavy boulder loaded on your wagon.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001216	Modestas who had nothing to lose, nodded his head to accept her proposal. But before he could consent to the bet, the old woman continued. {nl}'But I can't just give you such a favorable idea for free. Therefore I will add one more condition.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001217	When Modestas asked about the condition, the old woman answered.{nl}'You are to take the boulder, which I will load onto the wagon, to Klaipeda. Then, turn it into an object of value which everyone will recognize and esteem. If you are successful, then the punishment for losing the bet against me will become void. Your friends will not disappear. Although this is difficult, I will still give you one more chance since you've already lost the bet. How about it?'{nl}Like always, Modestas had no choice.
QUEST_20150317_001218	The moment Modestas agreed to the proposal, the old woman pointed her finger past him. {nl}Modestas turned around and to his surprise, the boulder he had trouble with was effortlessly placed on the wagon. By the time Modestas looked forward again, the old woman had already disappeared. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001219	Because Modestas had no ropes or equipment to secure the boulder onto the wagon, he had to lean the wagon and carefully drive it to Klaipeda. {nl}On his way to Klaipeda, he again met the soldiers who he had earlier bet against. Their commanding officer was now aware of what had happened thus far, and wanted to apologize to Modestas for getting him caught up and hurt in his subordinates' affairs. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001220	The officer returned Modesta's gold to him, and ordered his soldiers to help him transport the boulder back to Klaipeda. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001221	The officer and solders had sturdy rope, so they were able to transport the rock without worry of it falling off and unload it at Klaipeda. They decided to accompany Modestas all the way there. {nl}Modestas was very grateful for the help. {nl} Along with the soldiers, Modestas again ran into none other than the Alchemist he had lost earlier against.
QUEST_20150317_001222	To Modestas, a promise was a promise, so he immediately handed over the gold the soldiers returned to him to the Alchemist. {nl}The Alchemist, surprised by how Modestas could do this with no complaints or dissatisfaction, took the gold and conversed with him.
QUEST_20150317_001223	Not wanting to be left out of the conversation between Modestas and the Alchemist, the soldiers couldn't continue working, joined in, and learned about the Alchemist's past with Modestas. {nl}The Alchemist apologized to Modestas for turning his lead into gold, and promised to gather all the support he could for Modestas at Klaipeda. He then left. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001224	Soon after, Modestas and the soldiers reached Klaipeda. They set the stone down at the large open space at the center of town. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001225	When the boulder was set in its proper place with the help of the soldiers, the Alchemist who had left returned with another person. The Alchemist had brought with him a famous Dievdirbys.{nl}To the Dievdirbys, the Alchemist suggested, {nl}'Why don't you sculpt a statue of a goddess using this boulder, on this central site of Klaipeda? If this boulder is changed into a statue of a goddess, then nobody in Klaipeda will be able to deny its significance. I think that will fulfill your promise to the old woman.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001226	Everyone who was there favored the idea on the spot. {nl}The Alchemist took the gold he obtained from Modestas and paid it to the Dievdirbys as commission, and went to get permission from the Knight Commander and Bishop of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001227	As news spread, everyone in Klaipeda was pleased to know a Goddess Statue was planned for their city. {nl}However, one last problem remained, asides from winning their favor. And that question was, which goddess should the statue commemorate? {nl}The soldiers who gave help transporting the boulder were especially passionate about this issue, and began quarrelling again. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001228	The one who answered this question was none other than Modestas. {nl}Without any real intent, Modestas argued that the goddesses in power have guided him via divine providence to build a statue at Klaipeda that day. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001229	That the old woman appeared before him, that the many bets occurred, that the mountain erupted a stone for material was the divine providence of the goddesses, argued Modestas, persuading everyone. {nl}Thus, the people decided to follow the words of Modestas, and Modestas relayed to the Dievdirbys the order to create the statue. {nl}When the statue was finally finished, the citizens of Klaipeda gathered, curious to know the identity of the goddess who had been raised in the center of their beloved city.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001230	However, to their bewilderment, not a single soul could recognize the goddess whom the completed statue commemorated.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001231	The Dievdirbys who had sculpted the statue had already vanished deep into the Kateen Forest, so the citizens of Klaipeda repeatedly questioned Modestas for her name. {nl}Despite the numerous questions, nobody received an answer from Modestas. {nl}At any rate, this is the story of how the Goddess Statue of Klaipeda came to be. Even now that statue stands in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001232	And so, some people believed Modestas, having undertaken the goddesses' intervention, was an honest man who did not gamble. In reality, Modestas didn't stop making gambles until his death. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001233	Ever since then, whenever Modestas took on a wager, he always bet the same thing: the answer to the question of who the Statue of Klaipeda honored.{nl}To uncover the name of the goddess, numerous people challenged Modestas to a bet.{nl} {nl}But no matter the impossible odds, Modestas never lost a bet. Nobody was able to win the answer from Modestas for years, and time flew by.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001234	Though Modestas died an undefeated, invincible gambler, he had never bet anything other than the goddess' identity, living purely off the profits gained from such bets through the end of his life. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001235	In the end, this unknown goddess, in exchange for giving a livelihood to a certain gambler from Klaipeda, created an interesting, mysterious, yet beautiful statue for the city of Klaipeda, and a tale to last for times to come.{nl}{nl}

QUEST_20150323_001425	Four scouts were sent to Sirdgela Forest not too long ago but all of them went missing. {nl}Maybe they took the Thorn Forest too lightly... {nl}Please find their whereabouts.
QUEST_20150323_001426	I no longer have the strength to carry on, but will write this for anyone who has made it past this area. {nl}Naktis... it's funny that I yearn for a curse on the Monarch of Curses.
QUEST_20150323_001427	Naktis scattered cursed Tree Root Crystals in the area. {nl}To stop the curse, they must be destroyed.
QUEST_20150323_001428	Perhaps I shall soon lose my breath. {nl}Pilgrims, may the blessings of the goddess be with you!
QUEST_20150323_001429	Please be sure to find the scripture! {nl}One of the pilgrim souls entrapped in here must have it.
QUEST_20150323_001430	All pilgrims should offer different amounts.
QUEST_20150323_001431	This is not a reasonable amount.
QUEST_20150323_001432	Worship the Goddess Statue to receive blessings or move on to another area.
QUEST_20150323_001433	What a nasty curse. {nl}Let's see which is stronger. Naktis' curse or the goddess' purifier.
QUEST_20150323_001434	Of course I have the purifier. {nl}But I'm not giving it to you unless you offer me money.
QUEST_20150323_001435	It could be the one who stole the gypsum carving of the Goddess Statue, so get rid of the monsters there. {nl}If my hunch is right, then Naktis must be behind it. {nl} It might be far away, but I just heard that.
QUEST_20150323_001436	Naktis is looking for a clue to enter the Cathedral. {nl}If I'm right, not only has the Forest of Prayer been affected, but all of the Pilgrim's Way. {nl}Revelator, if you reach the Cathedral, please defeat Naktis. {nl}You must stop the goddess' revelation from falling into demon hands.
QUEST_20150323_001437	This place is dying. {nl}All the Tree Root Crystals have mutated.
QUEST_20150323_001438	Some Tree Root Crystals are useless unless burned. {nl}Some even fume at the core.
QUEST_20150323_001439	We must do whatever it takes to turn it back but... {nl}It's all so tiring now...
QUEST_20150323_001440	I feel like I'm drowning. {nl}The Tree Root Crystal is slowly killing me.
QUEST_20150323_001441	Do whatever it takes to destroy it... {nl}Please help.
QUEST_20150323_001442	I've lost all desire. Am I dying now? {nl}Eating and even breathing feels meaningless.
QUEST_20150323_001443	But it must go on. {nl}Unless that cursed Tree Root Crystal is destroyed...
QUEST_20150323_001444	There are things that Witas cares about. {nl}Won't he get his mind back if you show him those? 
QUEST_20150323_001445	Somebody's Diary
QUEST_20150323_001446	Those brothers are crazy. They must be completely nuts. {nl}When did it start? When Dora attacked Gracius? {nl}When they saw the demons marching?
QUEST_20150323_001447	Things have gone to hell since Gracius was incapacitated. {nl}From the very beginning, while I kept my mouth shut, everyone lusted for bloodshed. {nl}The town was like a volcano waiting to erupt. {nl}I thought it was an educational experience until then.
QUEST_20150323_001448	Then something snapped. {nl}A fellow clergyman, I can't remember who, had murdered Dion in his sleep with a mace and I... {nl}Everyone... {nl}No one could remember why they wanted to become a priest anymore.
QUEST_20150323_001449	This surely is not a teaching of Sir Maven. {nl}Greed? Laziness? How can we call killing one another, 'teaching a lesson'? {nl}I even envy Dion for dying first.
QUEST_20150323_001450	I can hear snickering somewhere. {nl}It could be the sound of Dora deceiving me. {nl}It doesn't really matter any more.
QUEST_20150323_001451	The trapped spirit gave you a scripture and disappeared.
QUEST_20150323_001452	You endured Witas' curse thanks to the medicine.
QUEST_20150323_001453	If you ever see the Devout Tree, please bring it back to life. {nl}I've heard that tree can block the power of the curse.
QUEST_20150323_001454	I believe that the evil will eventually fall and the goddess will be victorious. {nl}The mark of victory is right in front of me.
QUEST_20150323_001455	Anyway, I will go to the battlegrounds first, so please help the Watchers and my followers. {nl}I will see you at Nefritas Cliff.
QUEST_20150323_001456	This isn't over yet. {nl}I'll be watching you from Kvailas Forest.

QUEST_20150323_001463	The Tree Root Crystals of Pilgrim's Way are cursed by Naktis, {nl}as if to mock Sir Maven's teachings against laziness. 
QUEST_20150323_001464	It should be destroyed before the curse spreads. {nl}However, I cannot handle the Tree Root Crystals alone. 
QUEST_20150323_001465	Souls of Pilgrims swallowed by the monsters can destroy the Tree Root Crystal. {nl}Maybe I, too, will be one of them soon.
QUEST_20150323_001466	Notice for Pilgrims

QUEST_20150323_001500	Then don't. Pfft.
QUEST_20150323_001501	You're a bum.
QUEST_20150323_001502	Here. You're more pathetic than I am...
QUEST_20150323_001503	Ah, what's up? 
QUEST_20150323_001504	Farming alone keeps me busy.
QUEST_20150323_001505	I'm not sure yet... about that... rebellion.
QUEST_20150323_001506	It's enticing, but...
QUEST_20150323_001507	Do you have a written letter of Horacius? 
QUEST_20150323_001508	No wonder! Here you go.
QUEST_20150323_001509	I can't just give my precious farming tools to someone so suspicious!
QUEST_20150323_001510	Huh? Why should I trust you? 
QUEST_20150323_001511	You're very persistent. Here.
QUEST_20150323_001512	I wonder how well the preparations are going.
QUEST_20150323_001513	Go away.
QUEST_20150323_001514	Can't you see I'm busy? Go away. 
QUEST_20150323_001515	So what? 
QUEST_20150323_001516	I'll actively cooperate.
QUEST_20150323_001517	Our rebellion will be successful. We can't be exploited like this any more.
QUEST_20150323_001518	Ah, really? Then I should give.
QUEST_20150323_001519	The exploitation became too much at some point... There's no generosity any more.
QUEST_20150323_001520	Then give us some silver.
QUEST_20150323_001521	Here you go. Use it well. Everyone, cheer up!
QUEST_20150323_001522	What do you want?
QUEST_20150323_001523	Someone's even more pathetic than me...
QUEST_20150323_001524	Beats me. I'll just give it to you.
QUEST_20150323_001525	What are they talking about? The baron is hiding something...?
QUEST_20150323_001526	There is no such thing as a rest day for a farmer. 
QUEST_20150323_001527	I'm busy. Come back later.
QUEST_20150323_001528	Don't bother me.
QUEST_20150323_001529	Then, I will sign the petition if you pay 10,000 silver.
QUEST_20150323_001530	I've never met anyone as generous as you! So kind! Hahaha! Take this!
QUEST_20150323_001531	What a penniless bum. Go away.
QUEST_20150323_001532	That's some persistence you've got. Fine. I don't really trust you but I'll sign for Horacius' sake.
QUEST_20150323_001533	Oh, it's you... Hmm, the petition of Horacius... finally! The day of Rebellion is coming. I'll sign it.
QUEST_20150323_001534	Did you put the tools to good use last time? A petition? Sure, I'll sign it. For victory!
QUEST_20150323_001535	Let me read the details of the petition.
QUEST_20150323_001536	Oh, alright. Here, let me sign.
QUEST_20150323_001537	How can I trust someone who does not trust me? 
QUEST_20150323_001538	What is it? Are you a fraud? 
QUEST_20150323_001539	You're persistent... Here's my signature.
QUEST_20150323_001540	Later. I'm busy right now.
QUEST_20150323_001541	Rebellion or not, life itself is not easy for me... Give me something if you want to say things like that. 
QUEST_20150323_001542	Oh, thank you. Here's my signature. 
QUEST_20150323_001543	How stingy. I'll have to be stingy as well then.
QUEST_20150323_001544	Tsk, tsk. You're as cheap as I am.
QUEST_20150323_001545	Sigh... Okay. I can't do that. Here's the signature. 
QUEST_20150323_001546	I'm very busy right now so come back later.
QUEST_20150323_001547	My signature for the petition? You think I'd just give it to you? No. At least pay me for it or something...
QUEST_20150323_001548	Aha, now we're talking. Let me sign that. For the rebellion!
QUEST_20150323_001549	Is this a joke...
QUEST_20150323_001550	What kind of big plan could a bum come up with?
QUEST_20150323_001551	You've got some persistence. Here's my signature. 
QUEST_20150323_001552	I can't just take a break from farming. I'm busy right now.
QUEST_20150323_001553	Do you have around 15,000 silver? Show some sincerity...
QUEST_20150323_001554	Wow, thank you. My signature is all yours. Horacius really does good work!
QUEST_20150323_001555	Then I'm busy too.
QUEST_20150323_001556	Even if you're busy, you should take care of yourself. You're broke.
QUEST_20150323_001557	I'll just do it for Horacius' sake. 
QUEST_20150323_001558	Come back later. I'm resting.
QUEST_20150323_001559	The plan of Horacius? You must be talking about that thing. I knew this day would come. I'll definitely give you my signature. 
QUEST_20150323_001560	I am just waiting for the day of the rebellion.
QUEST_20150323_001561	I don't even have enough money for my sick family... I don't care about the rebellion!
QUEST_20150323_001562	Oh my, thank you! I'll definitely be joining the rebellion. 
QUEST_20150323_001563	Someone, somewhere, is gulping down food while I don't even have money to feed my family... 
QUEST_20150323_001564	You and I are both poor. We can't think of anything else while we're starving.
QUEST_20150323_001565	Okay. I'll sign it so you'll stop bugging me.
QUEST_20150323_001566	I'm dizzy. Come back later.
QUEST_20150323_001567	Can we finally get to sleep in peace? If so, I'll gladly sign that!
QUEST_20150323_001568	I believe things will soon get better.
QUEST_20150323_001569	I just signed...

QUEST_20150323_001576	Men under the command of the Baron have been here, though they weren't able to make it back. {nl}I watched everything with the wizard's eyes. {nl}Even the screams of Vakarine and her Kupoles.
QUEST_20150323_001577	That depends on whether or not you have the will to save the goddess. {nl}We can take time to talk about it. 
QUEST_20150323_001578	The limbs of Nuaele were all cut off. {nl}Now go find Aldona. {nl}She will take you and Hauberk to Nuaele's territory.

QUEST_20150323_001580	Once Nuaele is gone, we'll be able to fight the demons easily- even with only the Kupoles. 
QUEST_20150323_001581	Our biggest problem aside from the corruption breach was Nuaele. {nl}Now we can focus on the former. {nl}Go to Prison District 3. The goddess awaits your support.
QUEST_20150323_001582	Keep your guard up. {nl}This may be the secret to the last key, but the demons are still watching.
QUEST_20150323_001583	You will enter a special room once you get all five keys of Maven. {nl}In there, you will be tested to see if you're eligible for the revelation.
QUEST_20150323_001584	The number of candles is important. But for this secret, you must remember the order of the candles as well. {nl}It is similar to the first secret.
QUEST_20150323_001585	The device is operating.
QUEST_20150323_001586	A few manic farmers assaulted the people. 
QUEST_20150323_001587	Guards are working hard to protect the farm. {nl}Help them. 
QUEST_20150323_001588	I thank you again in the name of fate. {nl}From here on, I will follow the stars to find Goddess Ausrine.
QUEST_20150323_001589	Thanks to you, the seal of Uskis Arable Land is now stable. {nl}However, many other Revelators have lost their consciousness to the evil energy at the Spring Light Woods.
QUEST_20150323_001590	This most glorious Great Cathedral was built 660 years ago under the guide of Archbishop Silvestro Maven.
QUEST_20150323_001591	I can still hear it. {nl}The priests' prayers filling the kingdom. {nl}The endless march of pilgrims coming for the grace of the goddess.
QUEST_20150323_001592	It was like that until four years ago. {nl}Before the curse surrounded the Great Cathedral on Medzio Diena...
QUEST_20150323_001593	Candlestick
QUEST_20150323_001594	No candlesticks are lit. 
QUEST_20150323_001595	I buried Dallas. {nl}His death pains me so much.
QUEST_20150323_001596	More monsters! Run!
QUEST_20150323_001597	You were running so hard for me. {nl}Why don't you give me the key, kid? 
QUEST_20150323_001598	The breach of corruption, once open, will continue to expand. {nl}Revelator, please help Vakarine as soon as possible. 
QUEST_20150323_001599	There seems to be some reaction in the platform of benevolence. 
QUEST_20150323_001600	Bishop Ilam
QUEST_20150323_001601	Bishop Aurelius, who was ordained at a young age, soon took ill and lost his life.

QUEST_20150323_001603	Nature of the Curse
QUEST_20150323_001604	Gluttony, Wrath, Sloth...{nl}The nature of all curses that affect{nl}mankind is obsession.{nl}It makes the spirits of the dead prefer staying behind as opposed to going to the goddess. 
QUEST_20150323_001605	The difference is that it is the will of the dead that keeps the spirit behind {nl}while curses are forced upon by others onto you.
QUEST_20150323_001606	Naturally, priests learning the teachings of the goddess are not permitted to use it unless it's for experiments.
QUEST_20150323_001607	My Mission 1
QUEST_20150323_001608	Even if the Revelator gets the revelation in his hands, {nl}it's useless if it can't be protected.
QUEST_20150323_001609	The purpose of my secret is not only to protect the revelation from evil but also to prevent the greed of weak Revelators.
QUEST_20150323_001610	May you wander in the everlasting fog of the unknown if you recklessly approach without realizing my intentions.
QUEST_20150323_001611	My Mission 2
QUEST_20150323_001612	Those who challenge the Holy Mission won't just try to gently unravel the secret. {nl}Because of that, I had to plan many secrets and take measures against such barbaric actions.

QUEST_20150323_001618	On the day we prayed to the goddess that we would return, everyone cried tears of outrage. {nl}Our church will never succumb to the evil curse.
QUEST_20150323_001619	(There are many books left on the shelf. Which one shall we read?)
QUEST_20150323_001620	Dusty Book
QUEST_20150323_001621	(There is a dusty book with a memo on the chair. Which one shall we read?)
QUEST_20150323_001622	It was really dangerous a while ago. {nl}If you were any later, we would never have seen the third key.
QUEST_20150323_001623	If you use the symbol of spirits, you can see the area where spirits will be absorbed. {nl}Defeat the demons there and their evil force will be absorbed into the symbol.
QUEST_20150323_001624	Once the Symbol of Spiritual Power is charged, go to Veinika Altar. {nl}Insert the symbol in the Veinika altar and you will receive the third key of Maven.
QUEST_20150323_001625	The medicine should work.
QUEST_20150323_001626	The key is at Gaule Altar. {nl}I think you should leak that much information to Naktis' servants.
QUEST_20150323_001627	Of course, you'll need to use the transformation scroll before doing so. 
QUEST_20150323_001628	The secret supposedly unveils upon application of a holy force, {nl}but the trap will activate regardless if it detects an evil force.
QUEST_20150323_001629	The plan is to get the key after exhausting that trap using Naktis' servants.
QUEST_20150323_001630	Naktis' servants will be punished for prying on Maven's secret. {nl}Use that opportunity to get the key.
QUEST_20150323_001631	Even if the goddess condemns me for this... I will hold my head high,{nl} because it was for the protection of the revelation.
QUEST_20150323_001632	Did you find the last key?
QUEST_20150323_001633	This sanctuary is a treasure house of knowledge. {nl}You need to master the fundamentals of everything to protect the kingdom,{nl}and the revelation in the name of the goddess. 
QUEST_20150323_001634	Studying the demons is no exception.
QUEST_20150323_001635	The monarch of curses, Naktis... {nl}She has not shown herself yet, but I'm sure she's somewhere inside the sanctuary.
QUEST_20150323_001636	Perhaps she's waiting for us to get all the keys.
QUEST_20150323_001637	I am honored to be able to now guide you to the hidden room.
QUEST_20150323_001638	Focus on the colors of the orbs. {nl}You should insert the key in orbs of the same color.
QUEST_20150323_001639	Of course it is impossible to press down both footrests alone. {nl}You can use the wood chunks the demons scattered around... or ask colleagues for help. 
QUEST_20150323_001640	Coincidentally, I heard an eyewitness account from a refugee from this area. {nl}He asked for the safety of his family when I was being sent here... {nl}But I can't see any member of the Greene family, just refugees and monsters. 
QUEST_20150323_001641	And I found this mysterious seedling. {nl}Unlike others, we can feel a mysterious force from these. {nl}I can't identify this force in detail... {nl}But I'm sure it can purify evil.
QUEST_20150323_001642	We would have known better if Master was here. {nl}At any rate, we have to test if this seedling actually has the power to purify. {nl}I will do a simple purifying ritual. {nl}Get me some Ellom Leaves to grasp the pollution status of this area. 
QUEST_20150323_001643	Now, let's start. {nl}Please watch together. 
QUEST_20150323_001644	But he is a druid who has accomplished as much as I have. {nl}I think he can find out what the secret of this seedling is.
QUEST_20150323_001645	Also, you may experience something unusual if you have this twig. {nl}If you do, please tell him about it too.
QUEST_20150323_001646	Please find my colleague in Shaton Farm.
QUEST_20150323_001647	Aren't the dandelions around pretty? {nl}They disservice me, however, by sucking nutrients from the ground. {nl}If this continues, we won't be having a wheat harvest next season. {nl}Please remove the dandelions from the farm. 
QUEST_20150323_001648	Huh?
QUEST_20150323_001649	Huh?
QUEST_20150323_001650	Huh?
QUEST_20150323_001651	Huh? 
QUEST_20150323_001652	We're fighting hard. {nl}My mens' injuries are far more urgent than the farmers, wouldn't you agree? {nl}But some druid provided medicine only to the farmers which they then hid away. {nl}I have no words...
QUEST_20150323_001653	It's simple. I will look out for my men first. {nl}Bring me the medicine that they've hidden. It shouldn't be hard to find. {nl}Probably in some wooden box or grape wagon, possibly an empty house... Somewhere there.
QUEST_20150323_001654	But be careful. {nl}If this bowl fills with water, the spell will fume a special force. {nl}Then the monsters attracted to that force might attack. 
QUEST_20150323_001655	It was successful. {nl}Did you know these seeds are the same type as the mysterious seedlings? {nl}Seems like a wide range of land can be purified if it's grown well enough.
QUEST_20150323_001656	Growing these will use up parts of the cultivated farm however. {nl}The landlord of the farm in the reservoir area, Shaton, {nl}is here just in time so I should try persuading him while I can.
QUEST_20150323_001657	I'll meet you in the reservoir area. 
QUEST_20150323_001658	Soldier Mike
QUEST_20150323_001659	My parent passed away on Medzio Diena because of them. {nl}I applied as a soldier here for my parents' revenge. {nl}But... it's a shame. I can't even so much as look at them. {nl}Please, do me a favor and kill them for me!
QUEST_20150323_001660	They'll jump out when you approach the bush and more'll come out if you shake it. {nl}You're partly responsible for it so you should help.
QUEST_20150323_001661	There was a young couple that used to work here. They were very diligent. {nl}Everyone here did not work hard because they hated Shaton but they were different. 
QUEST_20150323_001662	But that Shaton abused and exploited them. {nl}They ended up dying of overwork. I have some of their keepsakes... {nl}I promised to bury it near the grave but I lost the bag I kept them in in the chaos of Medzio Diena. {nl}If you find an old bag, please check if there's a ring inside. 
QUEST_20150323_001663	Good. This potion cost me a fortune at the Fedimian Black Market. {nl}It was from an elementalist who seemed trustworthy, unlike those druids. {nl}According to him, this potion contains the essence of alchemy. 
QUEST_20150323_001664	He said if I pour this on the ground, a powerful obedient monster will appear. {nl}I'll use it to wipe out all the monsters in my farm!
QUEST_20150323_001665	Well, I've made some mistakes here and there but who doesn't? {nl}I mean, just look at grapes. How can you use water without wine mixed as drinking water? {nl}Even if the world is ending, you can't just drink plain water. That's barbaric! {nl}Hmm! Anyway, I appreciate the help. I'll listen to your story.
QUEST_20150323_001666	I'm just listening! I'm not going to do what you say! {nl}I don't think wheat will grow here no matter what kind of magic you use. {nl}I need to look for my son's body, so you better keep it short!
QUEST_20150323_001667	The wandering girl the farmers mentioned sounds suspicious. {nl}Elly agrees with me too. {nl}Looking at the facts together with her actions, we can't just dismiss her as an ordinary girl. {nl}Won't people in the Shaton family do anything about it? 
QUEST_20150323_001668	And Medzio Diena came a few years after. {nl}My family barely made it out alive and this is what happened to the farm. {nl}That's not all. {nl}It was mentioned that a blue disaster will follow the great disaster.
QUEST_20150323_001669	Think about it, it may have been a warning about those poisonous grapes. {nl}The true gold blessing will come after the blue disaster passes. I don't know what that means. {nl}I wanted to talk to her more but her father kicked her out saying she felt ominous. {nl}Where could she be wandering now...
QUEST_20150323_001670	Thank you. {nl}Maybe we earned some of the master's trust. {nl}If so, then it's all thanks to you. {nl}Good luck...
QUEST_20150323_001671	I heard things went well at the Shaton Farm. {nl}That's a relief. I will discuss with the master about the large-scale purification and how to make it successful.
QUEST_20150323_001672	Thank you. This will help many people recover.
QUEST_20150323_001673	It's a task of getting rid of the Lauzinutes across the underground tunnel. {nl}The owner's son disappeared in the underground tunnel long ago. It's creepy and I don't ever want to go in there.

QUEST_20150511_002008	Every object possess the inner strength of its possessor. {nl}And to add to the magical interpretations on that, they could also transform the shapes of their possessors. {nl}Objects belonging to demons could do it with relative ease.

QUEST_20150511_002009	But that's still just a theory despite the efforts of many frontiers. {nl}The possessor's inner strength and interpretations can never be fully understood if it were not for the possessor himself. {nl}That's why we hope for the blessing from the goddess or the wisdom from the possessor for the knowledge we lack.

QUEST_20150511_002012	We've finally arrived in front of the Zachariel's Royal Mausoleum. {nl}He was the first king of this kingdom and used an enormous number of people to build it. {nl}I believe only this place can answer the question I've had in my mind for a long time.
QUEST_20150511_002013	What was he trying to protect with this gigantic Royal Mausoleum? {nl}The answer must be inside, but the bleak atmosphere the interior exudes makes me hesitate to enter.
QUEST_20150511_002014	There's something inside the dark tomb.{nl}As I advanced inside, the large stone statues all turned to look down at me and then chased me out. {nl}I guess the great king in the past is still the great king in the present. {nl}I better investigate from the pillar outside of the Royal Mausoleum.
QUEST_20150511_002015	With the help from a young, kind historian, I was able to find a big clue. {nl}Yes. The best place to hide a tree is in a forest. {nl}Ruko Plateau and King's Plateau... I'm so close I can almost touch it. {nl}I'm confident the goddess sent him to me. May the blessing of the goddess always be with us!
QUEST_20150511_002016	Some pillars unlock the tomb{nl}and some altars lock it.{nl}The magical energy that surrounds{nl}the tomb moves by a key.{nl}But none among us can be that key. {nl}We were not Chosen.
QUEST_20150511_002017	The curse disturbs the rules of the universe that are being controlled by the goddess through human greed. {nl}These rules in the human world get influenced by the personalities of each person, their abilities and their potential power. {nl}The cases when these abilities get released depend on the conditions above.
QUEST_20150511_002018	According to the old writing left on the Great Cathedral, that is using a small part of the goddess' abilities secretly. {nl}Some people say that after seducing the weak minds of people, the demons used them for the source of the curse. {nl}May the goddess bless you!
QUEST_20150511_002019	There are two ways to release the curse: {nl}Remove the curse using a greater power or eliminate its caster. {nl}
QUEST_20150511_002020	Removing the curse using a greater power: {nl}This way depends on whether the power that overwhelms the curse comes from good or evil and from darkness or light.{nl}{nl}The most important factor for eliminating the caster: {nl}Even after eliminating the caster, the curse may not be removed due to other factors.{nl}{nl}I have no doubt that the power of the goddess is stronger.
QUEST_20150511_002021	There are mainly two ways to spread the curse. {nl}First, using equipment and uttering simple words. It sounds easy but it is, in fact, the hardest way. {nl}Therefore, from the example of the Pilgrim's Way, we mainly use the cursed ones as the mediums to spread the curse.
QUEST_20150511_002022	When a caster makes a curse, the caster has a tremendous influence on the mind of the victim. Their ego usually can't endure the feeling of guilt this causes. {nl}It seems the magic that was used on the cursed city of Ruklys is of a higher level than the one used on Naktis. We need to look into it more.

QUEST_20150714_002079	I don't want to die. {nl}We were just following the goddesses' words. {nl}Everyone is killing each other in the names of the goddesses. {nl}Who has deceived us? {nl}

QUEST_20150714_002081	The Royal Army needs competent people like you! {nl}Loyalty to the kingdom! To victory and a brighter future!
QUEST_20150714_002082	Pledge loyalty to the Royal Army and become a new and better person. {nl}The goddesses protect our armies.
QUEST_20150714_002083	Life and death... which one would you choose? {nl}The only way to survive is to swear loyalty to the kingdom!

QUEST_20150714_002086	The supplies should be here soon... {nl}Are they going to be late again?
QUEST_20150714_002087	You will need various tools when traveling. {nl}It's better to buy them in advance.
QUEST_20150714_002088	Goddess Laima... Actually, I don't know her that well. No one does, except for her priests. {nl}I heard she's the goddess of fate and foresight, but she has not once appeared before us.
QUEST_20150714_002089	I just remembered something while I was talking to you. {nl}Maybe Goddess Laima knew everything about the disaster beforehand.
QUEST_20150714_002090	I pray to Goddess Gabija everyday. It keeps the house warm. {nl}As you may already know, Goddess Gabija controls fire and since I'm a housewife, {nl}I am close to fire as well.
QUEST_20150714_002091	If you cleverly use the dry air that forms around areas of severe cold, {nl}you'd be able to freeze any object even in a desert. {nl}{nl}However, if you can't receive the blessing from the goddess, {nl}it won't be possible to make that kind of air.
QUEST_20150714_002092	The Records of the Master Himself
QUEST_20150714_002093	I've studied magic for a long time as a sorcerer. {nl}From the process, the advancement of sorcery can't be explained without relating with demons, {nl}and since they've fought against the goddesses, {nl}the field has been widened to the study of the goddesses as well.
QUEST_20150714_002094	While I was doing that, I learned of the field of accumulation. {nl}It's an empty field. The theory of the beginning and the end is a fantastic library,{nl}at the boundary of transcendency, all for one purpose.
QUEST_20150714_002095	Records about Disciple Laius
QUEST_20150714_002096	My other disciple, Laius, is clever and a fast learner but has an insatiable greed for knowledge. {nl}I am worried that he may fail the task. {nl}A scholar should always try to learn, but obsessing about it will make one walk the wrong path.
QUEST_20150714_002097	Despite that, Laius is a disciple I acknowledge. {nl}His passion towards me and knowledge is just being expressed in a wrong way.
QUEST_20150714_002098	I hope Laius realizes this himself. {nl}Since he is my disciple, I believe he can do it.
QUEST_20150714_002099	Records about Disciple Hones
QUEST_20150714_002100	Among my disciples, two of them followed me until my later years and,{nl}will be my successors after my death.
QUEST_20150714_002101	Hones, who is one of them, is lacking in scholarly intelligence. {nl}However, I am sure his faithfulness and efforts will help him follow my teachings.
QUEST_20150714_002102	Records of the Hidden Object
QUEST_20150714_002103	...I don't know whether I should thank the goddesses for this discovery or not. My greed for knowledge can ruin the world.
QUEST_20150714_002104	I can't sleep well for fear of my research results being spread by demon investigation. {nl}That's why I wish to pass the rest of the research to the one I can trust.
QUEST_20150714_002105	The Inheritance of the Master
QUEST_20150714_002106	As the priests and theologians know, Goddess Vaivora is in charge of the library,{nl}where all records of the world are stored. I was able to check several records in that {nl}fantastic library after the research and long studying I can't tell anyone about at the moment. {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002107	From the many records of the goddess, I was only able to see a few. {nl}Nevertheless, the fact that I checked the existence of the records with the important facts {nl}was astonishing. {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002108	The record which I can use to find the whereabouts of all the goddesses... {nl}If one had such secret information, it would be possible to predict the goddesses' {nl}future locations by analyzing what they did in the past. {nl}Because of that, their future plans may be disturbed or put at risk. {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002109	This is more dangerous because, if the demons find out the truth, {nl}their desire for the library will grow and, if they do acquire that knowledge, {nl}the world will be swallowed by evil. That's why - {nl}

QUEST_20150714_002111	Disciple Hones' Memo
QUEST_20150714_002112	If you want to find the master's research, you have to find three spatial magic stones {nl}and activate the fusion device.
QUEST_20150714_002113	The Spatial Magic Gem of Contract is at the reception room. {nl}The monsters probably have the fragments. {nl}Collect all the fragments of the magical stones and go to the{nl}preserved magic circle in the Grave of the Saints to restore them.
QUEST_20150714_002114	The Spatial Magic Gem of Offer is with the Templeshooter. {nl}The Wisdom Guiding Stone will help you find the hidden Templeshooter.
QUEST_20150714_002115	The Spatial Magic Gem of Promise can be found in Siaura Mine. {nl}Use the Soul Crystal on the monsters first to collect their Condensed Spite. {nl}With that, destroy the stones in Siaura Mine. {nl}Black Chasers will pursue from behind, avoid them and go to the end of the mine{nl}to find the magic gem.
QUEST_20150714_002116	When you find all three spatial magic gems, go to the fusion device again,{nl}and place the magic gems there. {nl}The path to the master's research will then open at the Laudi Tower.
QUEST_20150714_002117	Spirit
QUEST_20150714_002118	Please... save us from this horrible contract... {nl}Remove us from this... Contract of Enunciation...

QUEST_20150714_002121	The Pot of Silence is at Memum Corridor... {nl}I'm so... exhausted...
QUEST_20150714_002122	Where to start...
QUEST_20150714_002123	I was a disciple of Agailla Flurry when I was alive. {nl}I didn't have any magical abilities so I couldn't use magic.
QUEST_20150714_002124	That's why I survived Helgasercle's wrath. {nl}She must've thought she didn't have to kill me since I wasn't able to use magic.
QUEST_20150714_002125	I am confident I am better when it comes to theories than other disciples... {nl}That's why I studied magic. And in my studies, I learned of the magic stone of interaction.
QUEST_20150714_002126	I came here when Helgasercle attacked the Mage Tower. {nl}I thought that if I could use the magic stone of interaction, I'd be able to use magic.
QUEST_20150714_002127	But, Archon drove me away from the Mage Tower. {nl}Due to this disturbance, the magic stone activated defensive magic, linking my,{nl}and Archon's spirit to each other.
QUEST_20150714_002128	As a result, Archon was sealed and my body disappeared without a trace. {nl}We became shackled to each other.
QUEST_20150714_002129	I've been tied here for hundreds of years... {nl}Since I can't do anything with my astral body.
QUEST_20150714_002130	The bigger problem is that Archon was released as well. {nl}I lost the body, but Archon, who is a demon, is still alive.
QUEST_20150714_002131	Memorial Stone
QUEST_20150714_002132	By avoiding the eyes of Helgasercle, I was able to come here to continue my research. {nl}I needed to find a way. A way to reduce the power of demons and increase that magical power.
QUEST_20150714_002133	By my name, Valius, the one who walks the way of Linker, {nl}I swear that I will not surrender to the demons.
QUEST_20150714_002134	I've made many magical tools, but I wasn't able to repel the attacks of the demons. {nl}Without checking out the result, I close my eyes.
QUEST_20150714_002135	Records of Investigation
QUEST_20150714_002136	The basics of Linker magic are to find the common factors in each others' spirits. {nl}So it is impossible if the acceptor does not possess any magical abilities or bases. {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002137	I've completed the first stage magic stone. {nl}It still does not satisfy the previous objective of delivering the perfect magic,{nl}and magical power somewhat.{nl}But now, at last it is possible to accept Linker Magic even without magical ability.{nl}
QUEST_20150714_002138	Proposal
QUEST_20150714_002139	If a magician finds a way to share all his abilities and knowledge with another, {nl}then even those without magical abilities can become a strong magician,{nl}within a short period of time.
QUEST_20150714_002140	This way, you'd be able to hide from the eyes of Helgasercle,{nl}who is extremely afraid of the disciple of Agailla Flurry appearing.
QUEST_20150714_002141	However, I'm not sure if this is at all possible or whether or not it will have any side effects.
QUEST_20150714_002142	Design Proposal
QUEST_20150714_002143	The magic stone of the interaction can be made to work on the behalf of a Linker. {nl}However, maintaining the stone of interaction requires a considerable amount of magical power.
QUEST_20150714_002144	Hence, we decided to maintain the magic stone of the interaction {nl}with 12 regenerating magical power stones. {nl}If no problems arise, we will be able to maintain it, but if the magical power supply is cut, {nl}it won't last long.
QUEST_20150714_002145	Adrijus' Notice Board
QUEST_20150714_002146	I am looking for a stone rubbing of the tablet at the central sanctum. {nl}If you find any tablets with writings engraved, make a rubbing off of it. {nl}- Adrijus

QUEST_20150714_002148	It seems that someone has already made a rubbing since there is a vague trace of ink. {nl}Shall I read it?
QUEST_20150714_002149	King Kadumel finally dies.
QUEST_20150714_002150	Instead of the Mage Tower, the Tower of Fire would be a more fitting name for Flurry's tower.
QUEST_20150714_002151	This is a very secluded area so monsters usually prey around here. {nl}Be careful around here.
QUEST_20150714_002152	Research Records of Demetrius
QUEST_20150714_002153	In ancient times, humans lived with the goddesses. {nl}When I first heard of this piece of folklore, {nl}I thought it was made up out of respect for the goddesses. {nl}{nl}I started to investigate what historic background caused such reverence, {nl}as well as why this myth was created.
QUEST_20150714_002154	I increased the extent of my research. {nl}I traveled to many regions of the kingdom and collected similar cases. {nl}And I started to believe that this story was part of a bigger truth rather {nl}than just a small truth covered in fabrication.
QUEST_20150714_002155	The facts that we've discovered so far are thus: {nl}{nl}In the beginning, or a period not that far from the beginning, {nl}all humans used to live with the goddesses underground. {nl}I suppose the goddesses used to be more directly involved with humans. {nl}I have no idea why but soon, the humans left that place and scattered across the land.
QUEST_20150714_002156	This movement was made very naturally. {nl}If that hadn't been the case, then there must have been conflicts, {nl}and more fables would have been created as a result.
QUEST_20150714_002157	I believe the goddesses erased all memory and records of that time completely. {nl}However, we can't deny the possibility that another reason may exist {nl}due to the fact that this legend still remains despite the authority of the great goddesses.
QUEST_20150714_002158	And this is a very cautious prediction, but the creatures that we call demons{nl}may exist underground. {nl}{nl}Though that theory is hard to accept when we think about all the facts {nl}that are recorded in history and the present.
QUEST_20150714_002159	I can smell many Avietes. I heard they're effective... Could you share them with us?

QUEST_20150714_002167	I guess I'll take this tombstone rubbing to the person who wants it.
QUEST_20150714_002168	Since I've already made the rubbing, I'll give it to the person who wants it.

QUEST_20150714_002192	The Basics of Ignition
QUEST_20150714_002193	Ignition differs by elements, but with the blessing from the goddess, there may be cases where we can ignore that. {nl}To do so, we should try hard to achieve the scholarly knowledge and the faithfulness to the goddesses.

QUEST_20150729_002310	Aiste asked the elderly beggar, {nl}'Did you by any chance pick up the silver coins I dropped? Would you return them to me? I worked very hard everyday for those coins and really need them.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002311	The beggar was taken aback. Aiste was asking for the impossible. After all, finding dropped coins in Fedimian was unthinkable. {nl}The old beggar was about to explain this to Aiste but instead remarked, {nl}'I've also lost coins in this area. It would be nice if you looked for mine as you searched for yours.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002312	'Why don't you go to where you work and explain what happened to them? Make sure you look lost.' The beggar then hesitantly added, {nl}'In the meantime, I'll be looking for your silver coins here.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002313	And so he said, {nl}'Just as you've been able to pick up all my fruit, you should be able to find your lost money at Fedimian, so do not tell me to give you a second pay.' {nl}The orchard owner's cold words brought tears to the girl's eyes. {nl}The sight broke his heart, but even so, he did not want to give her any more money. {nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002314	He was soon overtaken by guilt and said, {nl}'If you really need that money, you should go to the silversmith's.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002315	The silversmith, after hearing Aiste's story, stated, {nl}'Even for children it is foolish to be so careless. How could you not know that all money that falls on Fedimian soil disappears, never to be found again?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002316	Aiste was surprised by what the silversmith said and grew sad. {nl}After a while she asked, {nl}'Then why is it that such a cruel thing happens?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002317	Even the silversmith did not know the true answer, so he improvised, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna must be taking them.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002318	Hearing those words, Aiste replied, {nl}'Then I will just have to go ask the goddess.' {nl}The silversmith was astounded and replied, {nl}'While you're at it, why don't you ask the goddess to return my silverware?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002319	An exhausted Aiste soon arrived at the Statue of Goddess Zemyna. {nl}She prostrated herself before it and prayed to the Goddess Statue represented, her head completely down. {nl}'Oh, goddess. Please return my lost silver coins.' {nl}Soon, while offering her prayers, Aiste could no longer hold in her sadness and she finally wept.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002320	How long did she pray crying? {nl}Suddenly, Aiste heard a voice addressed to her. {nl}'My child, have come to take back what you have lost?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002321	The goddess' voice was heard again. {nl}'Aiste, what your asking from me is not in a method I approve of. Where I reign there is no harvest nor fruits to those who do not work.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002322	'But I worked very hard today!'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002323	'I know. So instead, I will give you and the others a chance. Look under your feet.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002324	After a number of steps, Aiste thought about the silversmith, {nl}and, again, went to his house and knocked on his door. {nl}As if the silversmith was waiting for her return, he opened the door immediately and said. {nl}'I'm sorry. I regret sending you away like that. I'll give you some silver. {nl}This time, be careful not to drop any and get home safely.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002325	As the silversmith held out his silver coins, Aiste shook her head and said,{nl}'No thank you, the goddess returned all my coins. On top of that she gave me even more. {nl}I remembered you saying you had also lost silver, so I came to give you my extra coins. You don't need to give me yours.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002326	At first, the silversmith was skeptical about the coins being returned, {nl}so he was surprised when Aiste showed him genuine coins. After thinking for a while, the silversmith said, {nl}'Then how about this. You give me what you want while you accept what I was about to give you. {nl}Isn't that fair? On top of that I'll give you a pouch to carry your extra silver.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002327	After leaving the silversmith's house, {nl}Aiste suddenly remembered that the old beggar must still be looking for her lost coins and worried about him. {nl}On her way to the beggar, she met the orchard owner again. {nl}Upon seeing Aiste, the orchard owner was overjoyed. {nl}'I was looking for you. I'm sorry for sending you off earlier. As an apology, I'll give you your salary again. {nl}Please be careful not to lose it this time.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002328	The orchard owner took out a large amount of coins, more than what Aiste's salary was, and handed it to her. {nl}However, Aiste shook her head and said, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna already returned my money to me. The silversmith also helped me, so now I actually have too much. {nl}Here, take a look.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002329	Disregarding the amount Aiste had shown him, the orchard owner said, {nl}'Well, even so, I would be ashamed for not giving you my due, so please just take it.' {nl}After saying this, the orchard owner stuffed his coins into Aiste's bag and left. {nl}By the time Aiste could muster up the energy to call the orchard owner, he was too far away.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002330	She hesitated for a moment but then set her mind on the beggar. {nl}After a bit of walking, Aiste arrived at where they met. The old beggar spotted her first and hurried over to her. {nl}He showed her the silver coins he was clenching onto and said, 'Look! I found your lost silver.' {nl}Aiste received the beggar's silver and then showed the beggar her bag and said, {nl}'Look, I found your silver coins too.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002331	After that, Aiste also held out her bag and said, {nl}'This is a gift as thanks for looking for my silver. I was given this through Goddess Zemyna's grace.' {nl}Aiste then left before the Old Beggar could figure out how to reply.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002332	Over the jingling sound of gold, the old woman muttered. {nl}'If these two pieces of gold could ever marry, the baby gold would make me rich... but there's no life in these things...' {nl}Modestas heard those words, and decided to comment. {nl}'That gold won't make you rich by itself, so just put it into something worthwhile. {nl}Do you really think muttering at baby gold will do something?'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002333	The old woman spoke plainly, 'Why not? If this way bears fruit, it'll be safe and secure.' {nl}'That's ridiculous. You should do what I do and gamble.' {nl}The woman was incensed.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002334	'So, you think your betting ways are better?' {nl}'Why wouldn't I? There are moments where I could win or lose, but your way won't make any gold at all.' {nl}With Modestas' words, the old woman paused in thought. Finally, she said, {nl}'Then let's have a bet.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002335	The disturbing aura around her grew as soon as the offer reached Modestas' ears. He couldn't outright refuse. {nl}'What kind of bet?' {nl}'We'll see whether your way or my way will make us richer.' {nl}'And if I lose?'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002336	'Don't worry about that. You will win, and you will lose - That won't change. The rules are fixed.' {nl}'What do you mean by that?' {nl}'By taking my offer, you will fail once, and you will win once. No matter what happens.' {nl}'Well, yeah. Winning and losing is how gambling works.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002337	'No. No matter how unlucky it may seem, you will win your first gamble. {nl}And then, no matter how favorable life may seem, you will fail the next.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002338	Modestas was still confused by these strange words. {nl}'So, you're saying I'll win on every odd bet, and lose on every even one?' {nl}'Yes. It will be so. You will win coin, and then you won't. Is that not fair? {nl}One coin will be enough to succeed, no matter how many bets you make. That is my offer.' {nl}'You think I'll switch between winning and losing, huh?{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002339	With her hand to her chin, the old woman gave a puzzling response. {nl}'Three times each, should be enough. Return to me after you make six gambles. {nl}Naturally, if you don't have more coin after your sixth bet, I will win.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002340	Modestas seemed to tremble. 'How much should I earn, then?' {nl}'You start with one gold piece,' she replied, 'and when you return, show me all your gold pieces but that one. {nl}If you stretch that single piece to anything more, then you win. As for the time... you have one week.' {nl}'So, what do you get when I lose?' Modestas reminded her.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002341	'Well...' the old woman lingered, 'If you win, everyone will know about my gold - {nl}and you'll have the power of winning and losing. On the other hand...' {nl}''On the other hand...'?' Modestas said, tensely.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002342	'When I win, then after this, the friends you know will disappear every time you lose a bet.' {nl}Modestas was unnerved by the conditions set. He did not immediately object, but thought of the victory, {nl}and soon accepted. Modestas was, most of all, the kind of person who never backed down.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002343	Are you not busy? You seemed in a hurry on your horse before you passed by for a talk. You should stop worrying about me and go.' {nl} Sigfried, hearing Modestas' words, replied, {nl} 'I was busy, but I still have time to walk with you for another 10 minutes or so. This horse might not seem like much, but when it comes down to it he can go pretty fast.' {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002344	Seeing Sigfried not budge, Modestas tried again to persuade him, {nl} 'Wouldn't it be better to be early as opposed to be on time?' {nl} {nl} Hearing this, Sigfried became adamant, {nl} 'Do you not believe what I just said or are you willfully ignoring it all?' {nl} A disconcerted Modestas said, {nl} 'No, I didn't mean it like that......' {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002345	However, before Modestas could say any more, Sigfried said, 'If you don't believe me, why don't we have a bet?' {nl} {nl} Naturally, the words, 'Sure. What do you want to wager?' rose up in Modestas' throat.
QUEST_20150729_002346	Considering Modestas' habit, to simply not immediately accept a gamble took superhuman willpower from him. {nl} 'What...  what kind of bet?' {nl} 'We were going to bet on whether my horse is fast or not.' {nl} Modestas desperately fought his inner gambler.
QUEST_20150729_002347	As soon as the bet started, Sigfried tried every method possible to command his horse to move. Despite his efforts it didn't move a single hoof at all.{nl}At the end, Sigfried repeatedly cursed its strange behavior. Realizing he'd be late to his appointment without a horse, he threw the reins to Modestas and sprinted away.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002348	As Sigfried disappeared, Modestas felt uncomfortable.
QUEST_20150729_002349	You, the young man with the horse, can you come over and help us for a bit?' {nl} Modestas had no idea what these soldiers needed help for, but since he could no longer ignore them, he decided to head over. {nl} Once Modestas arrived, one of the soldiers said, {nl} 'You came at just the right time. We would like you to referee a small gamble we're about to make here.' {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002350	What started as a small banter turned into a big argument, which finally grew to become a big money bet. The soldiers had already gathered their money and only had to decide the winner. Unfortunately, every goddess got equal votes and a winner couldn't be decided.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002351	Thus, the soldiers decided to settle the bet by calling the first person who passed by, asking him who he thought the best goddess is, and deciding the winner from there. The soldiers agreed that the first passer-by would symbolize the will of whatever goddess he supported. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002352	Since a big jackpot was on the line, the soldiers waited with bated breath for Modestas' answer. {nl}Knowing there was no right answer to the question, Modestas simply said aloud the name of his favorite goddess. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002353	When he did, the soldiers reacted strangely. {nl} There was supposed to be an ecstatic winner and disappointed losers, but nobody seemed joyful nor disappointed. Instead, everyone had a bewildered look on their faces. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002354	Modestas, perplexed by their reaction, asked for an explanation to which one of the soldiers answered, {nl}'We originally had votes for four goddesses but your choice isn't any of them, so now we have five goddesses.' {nl}Then the soldiers resumed their squabble about how to decide the winner. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002355	The mood began to deteriorate so Modestas wanted to leave them. {nl}When he was about to take off, the soldiers blocked his path and accused him.{nl}'It's your fault the argument heated up even more. You're not thinking of just leaving are you?'{nl}Intimidated by the irritated soldiers, Modestas dared not to escape. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002356	Knowing Modestas, he could not simply sit on the sidelines watching a big bet grow. Eventually, he became enticed to join.
QUEST_20150729_002357	Modestas, caught in the heat of the moment and ending up participating in the soldier's bet, finally remembered it was his turn to lose.{nl}But it was too late.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002358	If you think about it, even if it was his turn to lose, all it took for him to lose was one more vote for any of the goddesses he didn't choose. With the odds of the next person walking by supporting his goddess being against him, the probability of winning was low anyway.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002359	However, the victor was chosen unexpectedly. A commanding officer found the soldiers slacking, disciplined them and was about to lead them away. {nl}The soldiers, obeying the superior's command, were about to march off when they shrewdly asked him which goddess he favored. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002360	Someone approached Modestas who had been lying down hurt and helped him get back on his feet. He turned out to be one of the people standing on the side, the wagon owner. {nl}The man who helped Modestas uttered with relief, {nl}'I am glad you're not too hurt. Your horse also didn't hurt himself tripping over that pit.'{nl}Modestas noticed a well-hidden pit where he pointed. {nl}The wagon owner continued.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002361	'My horse became injured here and can no longer pull my wagon. It's just an empty wagon, but at any rate, it won't be going anywhere for a while. That's why I have a proposition. Won't you sell me your horse? I believe with a healthy horse pulling the wagon, even my injured horse can help pull it in some way.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002362	It was an unexpected suggestion, but Modestas had to ride the horse to quickly find and catch up to the soldiers. He immediately refused the offer.{nl}The wagon owner tried to explain there was no way his injured horse can pull the wagon alone but Modestas was not persuaded. After his repeated refusal, the wagon owner offered a new suggestion.{nl}'Then let's do this. What if you buy my wagon? I will sell it for cheap. Since my injured horse can't pull the wagon, it will be better off in your hands.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002363	Modestas, after saying he'll be back if he loses the bet, began to rein his horse when the old Alchemist let out an eerie cackle. This caught Modestas' attention, who turned around and looked at his person.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002364	And right before his eyes, the lead nugget prize let out a sparkle and in a moment clearly became gold. {nl} The old Alchemist now snickered, 'Now you owe me one gold nugget, be sure to bring it.' {nl} Modestas protested, but as much as he looked, what the old Alchemist now held was clearly no longer lead. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002365	This time, no matter what, I have to wage a bet against the world's richest, well maybe not the richest, but a wealthy man at the very least.'{nl}As soon as he uttered these words, his surroundings shook like an earthquake and a heavy, deep voice declared.{nl}'I am the richest in this region.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002366	Modestas scanned his surroundings but failed to find anyone. So he asked,{nl}'Who are you?'{nl}The heavy deep voice answered his question.{nl}'I am where you stand. In your tongue, I am called the mountain.'{nl}Modestas in disbelief, couldn't help but talk back.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002367	You are... the mountain?'{nl}'That is correct. I am the mountain, and just as you are looking for, the richest around here.'{nl}'You are the mountain? Well, no, even if you are the mountain, how can you claim to be the richest?'{nl}'I own much land for my sierra stretches far. Further in me I contain large valuable lodes.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002368	Even if the mountain's veins contained nothing but rocks, he thought he could end up owning a large quarry to dig out valuable stones. Instead, the mountain had paid an inadequate reward.{nl}When Modestas pointed it out, the mountain disagreed.{nl}'All you own are two horses and a wagon.'
QUEST_20150729_002369	Surely one must wage things of equal value. This boulder is worth as much as you own.'{nl}With that said, the mountain returned to his former self, never to deal with Modestas nor anyone else ever again. {nl}Modestas, in his desperate situation, had wasted his crucial chance to just win one big boulder.{nl}Despite his bad luck, he consoled himself knowing at least he had horses and a wagon to transport the boulder.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002370	In front of Modestas, who had been worrying, appeared a familiar figure. It was none other than the one who had started the bet, the suspicious old woman.{nl}The old woman asked Modestas.{nl}'How is it? Is it going well?'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002371	Modestas confessed he was far from making profits, instead being in debt, and he had wasted all his chances to win and only had his last, losing bet remaining.{nl}After listening to his story the old woman flatly added, {nl}'Since you only have one bet left, go ahead and make your last losing bet. Then all that's left for you to do is pay up your end of the bargain for losing the bet against me.'{nl}Modestas was a man who loved to gamble but he was not the type to throw a tantrum nor was he a sore loser.
QUEST_20150729_002372	'Since you are unsure how to transport this boulder you suddenly won, how about this? Normally, I wouldn't change the initial conditions, but as an amusement I will give you a suggestion. Why don't you use your last bet to see whether or not I can lift this boulder up into your wagon? Even if you lose, at least you can have this heavy boulder loaded on your wagon.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002373	Modestas who had nothing to lose, nodded his head to accept her proposal. But before he could consent to the bet, the old woman continued. {nl}'But I can't just give you such a favorable idea for free. Therefore I will add one more condition.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002374	When Modestas asked about the condition, the old woman answered.{nl}'You are to take the boulder, which I will load onto the wagon, to Klaipeda. Then, turn it into an object of value which everyone will recognize and esteem. If you are successful then the punishment for losing the bet against me will become void. Your friends will not disappear. Since you already lost the bet against me, although this is difficult, I will still give you one more chance. How about it?'{nl}Like always Modestas had no choice.
QUEST_20150729_002375	When the boulder was set in its proper place with the help of the soldiers, the Alchemist who had left returned with another person. The Alchemist had brought with him a famous Dievdirbys sculptor.{nl}To the famous Dievdirbys, the Alchemist suggested, {nl}'Why don't you sculpt a statue of a goddess using this boulder, on this central site of Klaipeda? If this boulder is changed into a statue of a goddess, then nobody in Klaipeda will be able to deny its significance. I think that will fulfill your promise to the old woman.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002376	That the old woman appeared before him, that the many bets occurred, that the mountain erupted a stone for material was the divine providence of the goddesses, argued Modestas, persuading everyone. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002377	Thus, the people decided to follow the words of Modestas, and Modestas relayed to the Dievdirbys the order to create the statue. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002378	When the statue was finally finished, the citizens of Klaipeda gathered, curious to know the identity of the goddess who had been raised in the center of their beloved city.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002379	The Dievdirbys who had sculpted the statue had already vanished deep into the Kateen Forest, so the citizens of Klaipeda repeatedly questioned Modestas for her name. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002380	Despite the numerous questions nobody received an answer from Modestas. {nl}At any rate, this is the story of how the Goddess Statue of Klaipeda came to be. Even now that statue stands in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002381	Since that time, whenever Modestas took on a wager, he always bet the same thing. The answer to the question of who the Statue of Klaipeda honored.{nl}To uncover the name of the goddess, numerous people challenged Modestas to a bet.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002382	But no matter the impossible odds, Modestas never lost a bet. Therefore nobody was able to win the answer from Modestas for years and time flew by.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002383	And, as he lay dying, Modestas revealed the secret to the Goddess Statue in his will. When all became clear, the one who orchestrated all of this was none other than the one whom all other goddesses stem from, Goddess Ausrine.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002384	In the end, Goddess Ausrine, in exchange for giving income and an interesting life full of mystery to a certain gambler from Klaipeda, gave the city of Klaipeda a beautiful Goddess Statue, and a tale to last for times to come.{nl} {nl}

QUEST_20151001_002483	It is so good to hear that the Crystal Mine is opening again soon. {nl}I'd thought the world would've collapsed soon. {nl}Let's see, which equipment do you want me to take a look at?
QUEST_20151001_002484	The Revelator who saved the Tenet Church... I'd like to fix your equipment for free,{nl}but that is going to be hard due to the current circumstances.
QUEST_20151001_002485	It is great that the Revelator took back the Crystal Mine back from the hands of the demons.{nl}We feel embarrassed since it should have been retaken by us.

QUEST_20151001_002492	I've heard about the Tenet Church. Isn't it great? {nl}The expectations of you are getting bigger at Klaipeda. You realize this, right?
QUEST_20151001_002493	I could not save all the people at the capital city on Medzio Diena. {nl}But, I heard some Revelator saved everyone at the Crystal Mine. It is very good indeed.
QUEST_20151001_002494	About the Tenet Church, I know those Watchers well.{nl}I wanted them to move to Klaipeda since the world is dangerous these days, {nl}but they told me they feel more comfortable at Gele Plateau.{nl}Everything turned out well because of you.

QUEST_20151001_002499	I've heard about what happened at the Crystal Mine.{nl}I am sure the Revelators are the ones sent by the goddesses.
QUEST_20151001_002500	We are happy to hear that the Tenet Church was taken back from the hands of the demons.{nl}But, we still have a long way to go. We feel ashamed that we couldn't actively participate.
QUEST_20151001_002501	The goddesses always win.{nl}The defeat of the Demon Lord Mirtis by the Revelator is evidence.
QUEST_20151001_002502	Even though the goddesses aren't here, we have no doubts that we are going to win.{nl}The Revelator who protected the Tenet Church confirms that.
QUEST_20151001_002503	Everyone thought that the legend of Cunningham was just a story.{nl}But, since the Demon Lord at the Crystal Mine really appeared, who was that girl...
QUEST_20151001_002504	I've known the Paladin Master for a long time.{nl}He must have had some worries... You have done something great.
QUEST_20151001_002505	The Crystal Mine is the start of the ordeal.{nl}But, that is the sacred duty which you are responsible for.{nl}
QUEST_20151001_002506	When the great earth accepts the death and the stars in the sky draw the horizon...{nl}The seeker of truth who will stand on the line where births and deaths continue eternally.
QUEST_20151001_002507	Laima never showed herself in recorded history.{nl}And she was waiting for you while making the revelation in that long period.
QUEST_20151001_002508	Splendid. I've heard some Revelator defeated the Demon Lord.{nl}But, what was more surprising is that the legend of Cunningham is actually true.
QUEST_20151001_002509	I've pondered about many things since I heard that the Tenet Church was protected.{nl}All these disasters probably occurred for something way bigger than we could ever imagine...
QUEST_20151001_002510	I don't know who the Revelator is, {nl}but it's so great to hear that the Demon Lord at the Crystal Mine was defeated.{nl}Now, dreaming for a hope is not meaningless.
QUEST_20151001_002511	It was a good thing that the Tenet Church was protected,{nl}but I am more concerned about the well-being of the Paladin Master.{nl}On Medzio Diena, he focused on his recovery for a long time{nl}when he used the Divine Sphere in the capital.
QUEST_20151001_002512	I've heard the demons failed to occupy the Mage Tower because of the Revelator,{nl}who has appeared recently. But, if I was one of them, {nl}I would have prepared enough so that no one could try occupying the tower. {nl}Unlike what had happened to my family.
QUEST_20151001_002513	How dare a Demon Lord insult the teachings of Maven...{nl}Naktis has paid the price for it.
QUEST_20151001_002514	I have heard about the Revelator who drove out the demons from the Mage Tower.{nl}The Masters didn't do anything. Of course, I didn't do anything neither.
QUEST_20151001_002515	Everyone is just busy trying to survive after Medzio Diena, {nl}so they don't have time to think about going to the great cathedral.{nl}But everyone relies on the Great Cathedral. {nl}The Revelator completed a huge task.
QUEST_20151001_002516	I don't know who the Revelator is, but I could have saved Mage Tower better than the Revelator. {nl}Of course, my fees would have be met.
QUEST_20151001_002517	Even a person like me who goes after money, I know how important the Great Cathedral is.{nl}But, one thing that keeps my attention... The necklaces of the wise man, Maven. {nl}They are not in the hands of the demons right?
QUEST_20151001_002518	I came here by passing through rough winds and waves, {nl}while you've came here by going through the Thorny Vines Forest.{nl}You must be joking that you haven't found the goddesses. Seriously, how did you do that?
QUEST_20151001_002519	If the Mage Tower collapses, Fedimian won't be safe.{nl}The Demon Lord Helgasercle... the end of the obsession ends in such vain. 
QUEST_20151001_002520	Ever since the Revelators who dreamt of the goddesses appeared, {nl}the hands of the demons released them one by one.{nl}The same goes for the Great Cathedral. {nl}The proof that the Goddesses didn't abandon us is them.
QUEST_20151001_002521	Leaving the kingdom
QUEST_20151001_002522	A gigantic tree rose up from deep underground the capital city.{nl}The size of the tree was big enough that it couldn't even be compared against any mountain.{nl}As a result, many cities and towns were destroyed and many people lost their beloved ones.{nl}
QUEST_20151001_002523	But, the disaster did not end there.{nl}The evil energy started to surround the grounds and the monsters started to become feral. {nl}The demons started to attack.{nl}It was like an incurable disease, we didn't see any sign of recovery.

QUEST_20151016_002770	However, Premier Eminent didn't give a single hair about our resistance.{nl}It was all planned meticulously from the very beginning.{nl}Only to take over the Fortress of the Land...{nl}
QUEST_20151016_002771	We were swung around like idiots.{nl}The monarch becoming tyrannous, ordering Commander Ruklys to attack the hometown of Lydia Schaffen, and Lydia retaliating to our resistance because of it was all according to his plan.

QUEST_20151016_002775	Commander Ruklys said that he will go meet Lydia Schaffen for the last time.{nl}He said that as long as he sacrificed, we would be able to stop everything.

QUEST_20151016_002781	The Xth of X, Year 45X{nl}-{nl}Those soldiers seem only royal and experienced with its name.{nl}Even if the order came from their own monarch, do they even know who they are daring to fight?{nl}Do they not know what kind of person Ruklys is even after facing him?{nl}It seems that thing over their shoulder doesn't even contain brains.{nl}If not, the monarch of Kadumel was truly out of his mind.
QUEST_20151016_002782	264th day of the War{nl}-{nl}A friend who's acting as Ruklys' advisor told me that Kadumel is conspiring with a group of thieves to overturn the situation.{nl}To stop this, Ruklys with his chosen elite troops will leave the fortress in secret.{nl}Telling me to keep the secret at all costs, my friend had a very serious look on his face.{nl}
QUEST_20151016_002783	275th day of the War{nl}-{nl}After the secret mission, Ruklys' complexion didn't look too good.{nl}The plan seems to have succeeded with the words going around, but there's a worry that there might be some another problem.{nl}Their numbers and supplies of the Royal Army is far superior to ours, but there's no one to make use of the power and take control.{nl}In the long term, it seems certain that we will be victorious, but the the air between us seemed anxious.{nl}

QUEST_20151016_002786	325th day of the War{nl}-{nl}We cannot win...{nl}If we were to lose this war, the most regrettable thing would be that we won't be able to spread the words that Eminent that even the goddess won't be able to save, and that the world will still believe him as a chancellor who protect the kingdom.{nl}Not only does he use the monarch as a shield to carry out his evil deeds, but he also plants the fault on the monarch himself.{nl}
QUEST_20151016_002787	331st day of the War{nl}-{nl}No matter how this war ends, if given the chance, I want to kill the chancellor.{nl}If we emerge victorious, I will ask Ruklys to have me execute him, and if we fail, I will at least want to charge at his barricade and stab his chest with a blade; even if I die in the process.{nl}Eminent has started to take over the Earth Tower while leading the demons.{nl}As a human being, how dare he join forces with the demons...?

QUEST_20160224_003627	Book written in Runic Characters
QUEST_20160224_003628	This is a story about the nearly forgotten runic characters.{nl}Runic characters had been used since before the foundation of the kingdom by smaller northern tribes.{nl}Peculiarly, these people believed that the characters held magical powers.{nl}That's the reason why the northern people spent a long time to find those powers.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003629	Finally, a person was able to find the powers dwelling in the runic characters.{nl}They do not have any powers by themselves, but they are a channel for powers that can only be manifested through them...{nl}That was the secret behind the runic characters.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003630	He went straight to Goddess Saule and told her of the hidden powers of the runic characters, and the goddess rejoiced and blessed him.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003631	People came to call him a 'Rune Caster'.{nl}He became the first Rune Caster Master and fostered many more Rune Casters.{nl}He also created the Rune Stone so that the new Rune Casters would easily be able to use runic characters.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003632	One day, he vanished leaving only his Rune Stone behind.{nl}The Rune Stone he left behind has become a symbol of the way of the Rune Caster and has been passed down from master to master.
QUEST_20160224_003633	People often say that the goddesses are always with us.{nl}This is right not only in a spiritual sense but also a practical sense.{nl}That's because it symbolizes the fact that the goddesses are tending over us from their abodes.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003634	{nl}For instance, it is said that Goddess Vaivora manages a massive library only permitted to the goddesses.{nl}This library is also the dwelling place of Goddess Vaivora.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003635	{nl}Another example is the residence of Goddess Jurate which is rumored to be on a mysterious sea where human ships cannot reach.{nl}They say that a ship larger than most islands is the residence of Goddess Jurate.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003636	{nl}It is said that even Goddess Vakarine that goes around numerous locations has her own abode.{nl}Some say that there is a demon prison in a dimension that we do not know of, and that is the domain of Goddess Vakarine. {nl}But that is only one of the many locations that Goddess Vakarine visits.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003637	{nl}There are also legends that Goddess Laima has a palace deep underground where nobody knows of.{nl}There is no way to find it, it is also said that the Demon Goddess Giltine also resides there.
QUEST_20160224_003638	The Rune Stone...{nl}I haven't heard of that in a long time.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003639	In the past, I've met a person that was searching for the {nl}special powers hidden within the runic characters.{nl}He was filled with a pure passion for the task.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003640	He eventually found the hidden powers in the runic characters and became the first Rune Caster.{nl}A channel for power... The power of the runic characters was their {nl}ability to allow the casters to realized their strength through them.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003641	He crafted a Rune Stone to let others use the powers of the Rune Stone with easier access.{nl}Although his Rune Stone was nothing extraordinary, the following generations of {nl}Rune Caster Masters have carefully guarded his Rune Stone out of respect...{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003642	Unfortunately his Rune Stone was lost during the Petrified City incident.{nl}That is why the Rune Caster Master is still looking for his Rune Stone.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003643	The fact that you've come to me with knowledge of the Rune Stone... {nl}Perhaps it means that you were led here by its powers.
QUEST_20160224_003644	Yes. Although it is an old tale...{nl}I do have an idea of where the Rune Stone may be.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003645	The last place I sensed the Rune Stone was at the Royal Mausoleum.{nl}But that was a long time ago... I don't recall exactly where I sensed it.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003646	I remember the traveler that came to me asking for a blessing a few hundred years ago.{nl}He said that he had seen a mysterious stone with {nl}strange characters engraved on it near a waterfall.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003647	Unfortunately I was not able to know about what was occurring{nl}around the world after I had resolved to protect the revelation.{nl}Perhaps humans may know more about the whereabouts of the Rune Stone than I do.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003648	Yes. Maybe a human family that has survived for a long time such as the Jonas family...{nl}Someone that has eternal life like the Amjinas is sure to know something.
QUEST_20160224_003649	You mentioned 'Rune Stone', didn't you?{nl}Ah, could it be...{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003650	If you are talking about a stone with strange characters engraved on it, yes I do have one.{nl}I don't know how long it has been, but it has been in {nl}the possession of the Jonas family for generations.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003651	But it is treated as rubbish since there is no way of knowing what it is used for.{nl}Now I know it is Rune Stone thanks to you.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003652	Why are you searching for it though?
QUEST_20160224_003653	I see.{nl}It is useless in our hands, so we'll give it to you if you absolutely need it.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003654	No matter how valuable an object may be, {nl}it has to be in the hands of someone that needs it to be worth anything.
QUEST_20160224_003655	You've come here in search of the Rune Stone?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003656	I don't know where you've heard of it, but I do have one.{nl}I threw a tantrum when I was young to get it when {nl}it was gifted to the Winterspoon family long ago.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003657	Though, that's already a few hundred years ago.{nl}Now where did I put it...
QUEST_20160224_003658	Oh, as it happens, I have it right here.{nl}I have no use for it, so you may have it if you need it.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003659	It may have been destined for you since you are the first person {nl}to seek something that nobody wanted for hundreds of years.{nl}As a handler of time, I am thinking that perhaps it was a future promised in the past.
QUEST_20160224_003660	I can't seem to find where I've put it.{nl}I'll keep an eye out for it, so would you mind coming back later?
QUEST_20160224_003661	Do you mean the Rune Stone?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003662	I don't have anything like that...{nl}But I do have something that comes to mind.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003663	There is a place in West Siauliai Woods that cannot be accessed through ordinary means.{nl}I had faintly sensed a mysterious aura for a few hundred years...{nl}But I couldn't find a way to get there.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003664	Perhaps the item you are searching for may be there.{nl}How about taking a look if you know how to get there?
QUEST_20160224_003665	Do you know that there is a place in West Siauliai Woods {nl}that cannot be accessed by ordinary means?{nl}I had sensed a mysterious aura there for hundreds of years.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003666	I don't know how to get there, or what to expect to find there.{nl}You might be able to find something if you find a way to get there.
QUEST_20160224_003667	Rune Stone
QUEST_20160224_003668	(Unrecognizable characters are glowing.)
QUEST_20160224_003669	(It seems as if you require more Rune Stones.)
QUEST_20160224_003670	Something glowing seems to be embedded behind the tombstone.{nl}Take it out?
QUEST_20160224_003671	You can see many interesting things if you sit here.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003672	Not too long ago, a lady that seemed to be a mage came to ask something strange.{nl}I think she was looking for a stone engraved with characters that glow blue or something?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003673	I said I didn't know anything of the sort since I have never seen anything similar.{nl}She said something about going somewhere past Escanciu Village... I can't quite recall.
QUEST_20160224_003674	Rune Caster Master
QUEST_20160224_003675	Eh? Why am I sensing rune powers in you?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003676	Goodness! {nl}That is the Rune Stone of the first Rune Caster Master, isn't it?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003677	How did you manage to find it?{nl}I've been looking all over for it...{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003678	That Rune Stone... Could you give it to me, please?{nl}Although it may not mean too much to ordinary people, {nl}it means a lot to Rune Caster Masters.
QUEST_20160224_003679	Thank you so much.{nl}The Rune Stone of the first Rune Caster Master is finally back in {nl}the hands of Rune Casters after hundreds of years thanks to you.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003680	I don't know if it is sufficient as a reward, but let me teach you a little about runic characters.{nl}While extremely rare, there are some books written in runic characters.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003681	Perhaps if your magic is compatible with the runic characters...{nl}You may be able to become a Rune Caster.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003682	No, I am certain that you will be able to become a Rune Caster.{nl}I think that the will of the runic characters led you here to me.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003683	Rune Casters can cast powerful magic through Rune Stones.{nl}However, it does take a long time to gather the required magic.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003684	Oh... Have I been talking too much about Rune Casters?{nl}My bad, but thank you so much for finding the Rune Stone.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003685	Come back to me if you wish to become a Rune Caster.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003686	I don't know if you could call it a reward, but I will teach you some runic characters.{nl}Although quite rare, there are occasionally some books written in runic characters.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003687	You may be able to obtain important information from long ago.{nl}Not a bad deal, don't you agree?

QUEST_20160224_003703	After the day in which you humans call Medzio Diena...{nl}Goddess Zemyna has hidden herself from the human realm.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003704	The life of humans and the fertility of vegetation...{nl}Medzio Diena must have been a great woe for the goddess of fertility.
QUEST_20160224_003705	We Kupoles have asked for her presence as the humans are longing for her...{nl}But Goddess Zemyna is obstinately refusing to meet us.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003706	To make things worse, the demons have started to attack the Earth Tower.{nl}It has become hard to even request a meeting with her because of the attacks.
QUEST_20160224_003707	Revelator, please find Goddess Zemyna.{nl}Maybe you will be able to change the goddess' mind.
QUEST_20160224_003708	If it helps finding Goddess Zemyna...{nl}I'll tell you what I know about the Earth Tower.
QUEST_20160224_003709	Unfortunately, there is not much I can tell you about Goddess Zemyna.{nl}I am sorry.
QUEST_20160224_003710	I pray that you will be able to meet Goddess Zemyna.

QUEST_20160224_003712	They say that there are many artifacts from unknown periods in the Earth Tower.{nl}If you find something, how about exchanging for something I have?
QUEST_20160224_003713	There is someone who will want what we have even if the world ends.{nl}Our job is to supply it if there is a demand for it.
QUEST_20160224_003714	There is almost nothing known about the Istora Ruins.{nl}The fact that they were discovered thanks to being pushed up after Medzio Diena is about it.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003715	Then some adventures came to know about the Earth Tower here.{nl}It won't even open unless you are a Revelator.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003716	That's why we're making a living selling various of items to Revelators.{nl}Since only Revelators can carry relics from inside the tower.
QUEST_20160224_003717	One thousand and two hundred years ago...{nl}This tower has been built by the remaining vestiges of an ancient era forgetten by humans.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003718	A long time ago, the humans that lived together with the goddesses...{nl}They created the tower out of desire for the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003719	But time erased even the memories of the tower.{nl}A thousand years after the rule of King Zachariel, only Zemyna is hiding here now.
QUEST_20160224_003720	It is certain that Goddess Zemyna is in the tower...{nl}But unfortunately, even I do not know where she could be.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003721	As Goddess Zemyna does not wish to see anybody...{nl}I assume she is in the innermost depths of the tower.
QUEST_20160310_003722	Stories of battles with monsters and demons are always useful to the goddesses.{nl}Will you tell me a bit more?
QUEST_20160310_003723	It seems you're still lacking.{nl}Will you tell me more stories later?

QUEST_20160310_003726	Oh, you've been to a new region.{nl}Will you tell me about what it was like?
QUEST_20160310_003727	You already told me about that.{nl}But if you go somewhere new do come and tell me about it.
QUEST_20160310_003728	Many places have changed after Medzio Diena.{nl}The information you shared will be very useful for everyone.
QUEST_20160310_003729	It looks like you don't have any new stories to tell. {nl}Come back if you get to explore any new areas.

QUEST_20160310_003735	Before you read this, please make sure no one else is around.{nl}I'm Gatre and I'm helping Sarma with his experiments.{nl}Sarma approached me saying he wanted to do research to get the forest's fruit trees back to normal.{nl}
QUEST_20160310_003736	We had lost a place to live after the trees grew too big and we couldn't eat the fruits, so Sarma's proposal appealed to us.{nl}He offered to share food with whoever helped him so most people from my village ended up accepting.{nl}
QUEST_20160310_003737	At first we worked hard to help him save our hometown.{nl}But then Sarma's research started to feel somewhat strange.{nl}It seems like Sarma's research has little to do with getting the overgrown trees back to normal.{nl}The experiments are mostly done on monsters, not on trees, and I've even fallen unconscious during one experiment.{nl}
QUEST_20160310_003738	I suspect Sarma is doing this to cover up for something evil.{nl}Since I have no proof, there's really nothing I can do.{nl}I can't ask you to trust every single word of mine,{nl}but I at least want to know if my suspicions are correct or if I'm simply overthinking it.{nl}
QUEST_20160310_003739	I'm being watched by Sarma almost constantly. {nl}Please understand that this is the only way I could communicate this to you.{nl}If you agree to help me, when you bring back this manual please say you did everything according to it.
QUEST_20160310_003740	Discarded Document
QUEST_20160310_003741	For the experiment, we collected juice and seeds from the fruits of the overgrown trees.{nl}We were lost in despair, but now we feel hope again.{nl}I only wish this research will bring back our town...
QUEST_20160310_003742	Sarma asked us to capture a weak monster.{nl}We aren't fit for fighting, but we did our best for the village and managed to catch a monster.{nl}Only a few people were injured in the process.

QUEST_20160811_004231	{nl}The pain was unimaginable.{nl}It was as if my entire body was burning down?
QUEST_20160811_004232	{nl}I realize there are still brothers who refuse to surrender.{nl}My words must sound like an excuse.
QUEST_20160811_004233	{nl}However... They're not just starving them, they're threatening their own lives!
QUEST_20160811_004234	{nl}When the goddesses themselves show no signs of returning, there is no hope whatsoever.

QUEST_20160811_004236	{nl}I have with me a Revelator.{nl}Leave behind your past mistakes and help us take back the monastery.
QUEST_20160811_004237	What did you say?{nl}This is... a Revelator?

QUEST_20160811_004239	Please, let me help.{nl}I shall pay for my sin after we recover the monastery.
QUEST_20160811_004240	Very well. However...{nl}Did you happen to see the keeper of the monastery keys among the brothers who escaped?
QUEST_20160811_004241	I did see them, but...{nl}To tell you the truth about what happened... I'm very sorry.
QUEST_20160811_004242	{nl}The keeper was taken by High Officer Medea and lost their life.{nl}The keys are with Medeja now, I'm afraid.

QUEST_20160811_004244	{nl}She specializes in hallucinations.{nl}She can make others see what she wants, I imagine that's why she was working outside the monastery.
QUEST_20160811_004245	{nl}She did say, however, that she had been sent by the High Officer of an organization above the Order.{nl}The strong divine energy of the monastery was interfering with their power; she came to suppress it.
QUEST_20160811_004246	{nl}High Officer Domantas is also attempting to contaminate the energy of the monastery.{nl}They both want to suppress its divine power.
QUEST_20160811_004247	{nl}I was called for this very same task and was reporting to them the locations where the energy is strongest.
QUEST_20160811_004248	It's a shame to see such a kind person gone...{nl}But this is not the time to commiserate.
QUEST_20160811_004249	{nl}We must stop Medea's cruel deeds and take back the keys to the monastery.{nl}Brother Mattas. How can we lure Medea?

QUEST_20160811_004254	{nl}You seem uncertain.{nl}There should be nothing more to hide now, should there?
QUEST_20160811_004255	Did you not hear about my specialty?{nl}That's a shame. The one called Stella is already under my power.
QUEST_20160811_004256	{nl}She's rather popular with the monks, isn't she?{nl}Having her surrender will do wonders in converting them.{nl}Do you see? This was all to get to you both.
QUEST_20160811_004257	{nl}I heard you defeated Domantas. Not quite the commoner, are you?{nl}And yet, you were no match for my wits.
QUEST_20160811_004258	{nl}You have no choice now but to become a loyal puppet of our Order.{nl}When my superiors see your talent, losing one or two devices will be nothing but a minor concern to them.
QUEST_20160811_004259	{nl}Now, convert to the Order.
QUEST_20160811_004260	Not a weak mind, I see, you can even move inside that magic circle.{nl}But then, I'd already figured that from the way you refused my kind proposal. I guess you've made your mind, then?
QUEST_20160811_004261	The magic circle is activated.{nl}Fortunately we have brother Mattas watching out for us.
QUEST_20160811_004262	{nl}Let's head to the monastery now.

QUEST_20160811_004267	{nl}Are you perhaps here to rescue the brothers?{nl}Seeing how you broke the barrier, you seem not just brave but rather clever as well.
QUEST_20160811_004268	{nl}I'm afraid your brothers will soon join our Order, however.{nl}And you will be next, of course. The question is whether we need to force you or not.
QUEST_20160811_004269	{nl}The so-called Revelator you brought along has hurt my kin and can therefore not be spared, but you...{nl}I am giving you a final chance.

QUEST_20160811_004272	{nl}You are an abomination.{nl}Do not try to hide the fact that it's the demons who are behind you.
QUEST_20160811_004273	{nl}I am aware that you yourself are a demon.{nl}Know that for as long as we live, neither I nor the Revelator will ever abandon the grace of the goddesses.
QUEST_20160811_004274	{nl}Leave our monastery and release our brothers immediately!
QUEST_20160811_004275	It that your final choice?{nl}The noble martyr?
QUEST_20160811_004276	{nl}As you wish. We have plenty of talent.{nl}No need to insist any more with you.
QUEST_20160811_004277	{nl}Let the Divine Tree take your spirit then, no one will ever even know you're dead.

QUEST_20161005_004345	Let's take a closer look.{nl}I'm sure we missed something.

QUEST_20161005_004360	This place must be important to someone when looking at the frequency of visits from higher-ups.{nl}I hate how much we have to clean the place and look disciplined every time they come over.
QUEST_20161005_004361	There are rumors that the Wall was constructed for use against demons as well as humans.{nl}There may be some truth in these rumors when you take in the fact that it has three layers, as well as a large amount of magic circles and mysterious devices all over the place.

QUEST_20161005_004386	I think that we've got this wrong.{nl}Let's try another theory.
QUEST_20161005_004387	Aha...!{nl}I think we've figured out the secrets of the Wall!
QUEST_20161005_004388	Miko Master
QUEST_20161005_004389	Wait. I feel the energies of a Divine Spirit within you.{nl}How can this be?{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004390	Is that... Gohei?{nl}It even has a Divine Spirit residing in it.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004391	It may be from one of the Miko Masters that came to the Kingdom long ago.{nl}You know, I think we can utilize it to help with the problems plaguing the Kingdom...
QUEST_20161005_004392	We seem to always be underhanded in this line of work.{nl}Come back to see me if you have an interest in becoming a Miko.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004393	I sense that the Divine Spirits residing in the Gohei have taken a liking to you as well.{nl}An individual that Divine Spirits like will be able to adjust to Miko work easily.
QUEST_20161005_004394	We seem to constantly be underhanded in this line of work.{nl}I always hope that there will be more volunteers willing to work as Mikos...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004395	Thank you anyways.{nl}Our work was made a bit easier thanks to the Gohei you brought us.
QUEST_20161005_004396	The Divine Spirits seem to like you even if you aren't linked to the Miko path in any way.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004397	The Kannushi always has something to criticize.{nl}Stuff about always having to be modest and to persevere and such.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004398	Protect the weak and show any bad guys why they shouldn't be bad!{nl}Don't you think that's enough?
QUEST_20161005_004399	It's so irritating.{nl}I'm already busy as it is by myself, but there always seems to be something else that pops up.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004400	Not too long ago, I had to nurse a weakened Water Divine Spirit, as well as take care of a fiesty demon.{nl}I wasted time on the way back as well trying to help someone that was lost.{nl}I don't even know this area myself.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004401	Then I had to go and visit the Earth Divine Spirit, and also go and tend to a Divine Spirit who was depressed because the house he had been protecing had collapsed.{nl}Not only that...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004402	What? Why are you looking at me like that?{nl}Let me tell you, I'm not doing this because I want to.{nl}I'm only doing this because I have to as a Miko.
QUEST_20161005_004403	Would you really do that?{nl}Thanks.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004404	I'm a Miko from a relatively famous Shrine outside of the Kingdom.{nl}I am researching the calamities that happened after Medzio Diena on the the orders of the Kannushi.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004405	It was all fine and well up to the point where I became the Miko Master...{nl}I haven't had a moment to rest after Medzio Diena.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004406	There I was, thinking that I would be able to relax in my room sipping tea after becoming Master.{nl}That was so naive of me...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004407	It's an annoyance, but the Kannushi did ask me to look into matters, and I can't really leave the Divine Spirits trembling in terror either.{nl}So that's why I am going around putting barriers up, finding Divine Spirits and settling matters.
QUEST_20161005_004408	Martuis Storage Room Chest

QUEST_20161005_004421	I am a Divine Spirit helping the Miko Master Hitomiko.{nl}I know more about her than anyone else.
QUEST_20161005_004422	Hitomiko came here because of the Divine Spirits.{nl}Those who had been awakened long ago in the Capital.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004423	Any of the antique items from the Royal Family could have Divine Spirits residing in them.{nl}They have awakened by recieving spiritual energy from the Divine Tree for a long time.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004424	However, that spiritual energy was cut after Medzio Diena...{nl}They were about to... I believe the word they use here is 'explode'?{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004425	Hitomiko couldn't let the precarious situation be left unattended...{nl}Especially since Princess Kaonilla could be put in danger, as she is always surrounded by the antiques of the Royal Family.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004426	That's why she came here, even though she knew she might not be welcomed.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004427	Why can't the Priests feel the Divine Spirits?{nl}Hmm... think of it as the inability to see things at a distance while using a magnifying glass.{nl}Though, I'm not quite sure myself.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004428	Hitomiko managed to gain Princess Kaonilla's permission to prepare the ritual.{nl}She needed to know how the Divine Spirits looked after Medzio Diena.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004429	I think that the ritual itself was nothing new to Hitomiko.{nl}However, it must have been something surreal to the royalty and priests watching her.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004430	You know, the way she would sway the Gohei and sprinkle something.{nl}Seeing blue energies emerge from certain items to go into Hitomiko's red pouch was a sight to behold.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004431	Finally, the red pouch was placed on the black table with the golden silks that Hitomiko had crafted...{nl}The pouch was then burned by Hitomiko, in front of numerous onlookers.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004432	I bet that was a sight to write down in any history books published after Medzio Diena.{nl}That's how Hitomiko was able to deal with the Divine Spirits near Princess Kaonilla.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004433	That wasn't all though.{nl}The Princess lost consciousness right after the ritual.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004434	The impressive performance hadn't ended though.{nl}Hitomiko remained calm as if she had expected this when nobody else had, and started moving towards the Princess.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004435	Hitomiko approached the throne where Kaonilla was and took a close look.{nl}Then she slowly turned around to all that were watching and said the following.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004436	There had been an evil Divine Spirit that had been possessing Princess Kaonilla...{nl}The evil Divine Spirit had gone to hide in the depths of the Princess' consciousness.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004437	I think she was trying to express the situation in terms that the people of the Kingdom could understand.{nl}Anyways, the room became silent before erupting in outrage.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004438	It was to be expected of course.{nl}It could've be interpreted as an attack on the Princess under the guise of performing a ritual to appease the Divine Spirits.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004439	However, Hitomiko calmed the people in the room and started talking to the priests.{nl}She said that she required their help as well in order to rid the Princess of the Divine Spirit...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004440	Hitomiko calmly told the priests what they needed to do.{nl}They took places near the throne where the Princess was sitting.{nl}After that... just imagine.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004441	All of the priests gathered under the guidance of Hitomiko...{nl}Using their powers on one person!{nl}I don't think that any evil presence could withstand such a situation.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004442	The Princess was able to regain consciousness.{nl}Even if she was a bit worn out.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004443	Hitomiko's work was recognized and she was given similar prestiege as the priests.{nl}In this Kingdom at least.
QUEST_20161005_004444	My signature for the petition? You think I'd just give it to you? {nl}No. At least pay me for it or something...
QUEST_20161005_004445	I'm dizzy. Come back later.
QUEST_20161005_004446	Ah, you're the one Adrijus sent. {nl}I've obtained the diluting solution he ordered. {nl}Be careful not to break the glass.
QUEST_20161005_004447	If you understand, start trying to think of a way to revert this.{nl}This simply cannot be ignored.

QUEST_20161005_004477	No matter how I tell them that it was a mistake, they refuse to listen.{nl}That's why I have decided to try and find Lydia Schaffen's Flechette to try and undo my wrongdoings.

QUEST_20161005_004486	I, Kadumel, from the line of King Zachariel raise this Epitaph in order to leave records of the victory over the rebellion that was put down on Year 464 of the Kingdom.
QUEST_20161005_004487	Year 1096 of our Kingdom, Priest Lintas and his colleagues who are upholding the will of Maven the Wise are only now correcting the wrong records and accurately describing the wrongdoings of the Royal family and shortcomings of heroes.{nl}We swear by the name of the Goddess that this is the truth and may we suffer for eternity should this not be the case.
QUEST_20161005_004488	The Fortress of the Land which was created by Ruklys in order to safeguard Goddess Laima's Revelation from the demons raised King Kadumel's suspicions and the civil war that resulted from that caused great damage to the Kingdom and the death of Ruklys.{nl}We would like to bring to light the fact that Ruklys had no other intentions than devout faith in the Goddess and that King Kadumel was also influenced by Eminent.
QUEST_20161005_004489	We announce that those who died as prisoners here as traitors were the victims of misunderstandings.{nl}We argue that we should not mistakenly judge their actions when their only fault was to follow the lead of the devout Ruklys.
QUEST_20161005_004490	The reason Ruklys was unable to tell the King about the Commandments of the Goddess was because the King was Kadumel.{nl}Even King Oluche who had been making wrong decisions remembered to ask the will of the Goddess and decided to step down and raise King Enael the Kind to the throne.{nl}All that read this monument should do well to remember that no good comes from infighting within the Kingdom and to view that as a great deed is even more foolish.
QUEST_20161005_004491	Pouch
QUEST_20161005_004492	You can see a pouch.{nl}You are curious to what is inside.
QUEST_20161005_004493	Rewritten Monument

QUEST_20161005_004500	{nl}It also holds great meaning as this is where the remnants of the rebellion are to remain for their lives.
QUEST_20161005_004501	Priest Lintas and his colleagues rewrite the contents of the monument.
QUEST_20161005_004502	{nl}The Fortress of the Land was created in order to safeguard the Revelation of Goddess Laima from the demons.{nl}However, that raised the suspicions of King Kadumel.
QUEST_20161005_004503	{nl}The civil war that resulted from that small suspicion resulted in the death of Ruklys.{nl}We wish to prove that Ruklys had no other intentions than devout faith in the Goddess.

QUEST_20161005_004505	{nl}Those that lay here have died as prisoners and traitors.{nl}However, we announce that they were the victims of misunderstandings.
QUEST_20161005_004506	{nl}They who are now resting in peace had no fault but that of following Ruklys...{nl}We argue that we must now properly judge their actions under a new light.

QUEST_20161005_004508	{nl}Even if King Oluche made many wrong decisions, he listened to the Goddess.{nl}As a result of the consultation, King Enael was able to rise to the throne.
QUEST_20161005_004509	{nl}All that read this must learn from the examples mentioned.{nl}There must not be another civil war and people must not beleive that such conflicts are proud deeds.
QUEST_20161005_004510	Priest Lintas suddenly seems to be acting a bit strange...

QUEST_20161005_004512	{nl}Goddess Lada seems to be at Seir Rainforest.
QUEST_20161005_004513	{nl}They all seem to be in areas where demons often appear.
QUEST_20161005_004514	{nl}Uskis Arable Land is famous for it's bees.{nl}I've heard that Revelators are lured there though.
QUEST_20161005_004515	Goddess Austeja is said to be in Vernike Island, but I've never heard of that place before.

QUEST_20161005_004519	The secret location within the Great Woodlands?{nl}There are more places where I don't know about even if I did hear them from Vaivora's Koru.
QUEST_20161005_004520	Goddess Laima captured by Giltine... Why would she be keeping Goddess Laima?
QUEST_20161005_004521	Unlike the others, Goddess Ausrine is somewhere mysterious where Koru can't talk about.
QUEST_20161005_004522	We've learned about the whereabouts of the Goddesses, but most of the locations are unfamiliar.
QUEST_20161005_004523	Sage Baseline
QUEST_20161005_004524	The underlying power of the Sage is magic.{nl}However, in order for that magic to actually be applied, a Sage requires two more things.{nl}One is the ability to focus magic on one location, and the other is a baseline on which to focus the energy.
QUEST_20161005_004525	If any wizard has enough magic to control space, the tenacity and concentration to focus that magic, all he would require is this baseline.
QUEST_20161005_004526	Sages can't usually use specific objects or geometry to focus magic as they cannot balance the otherworldly space that the Sages usually borrow or connect to.
QUEST_20161005_004527	This is like tying a rope to a twig before casting it into the abyss.{nl}Therefore, any baseline a Sage uses must always maintain a certain capacity. This means that there are sever limitations on what can be used.
QUEST_20161005_004528	A highly trained Sage might be able to use the mountains or the sea, but those will be much to large for most Sages to utilize.
QUEST_20161005_004529	 In other words, they are more than usable, but the Sages do not have the capacity to fully realize their properties.{nl}As such, suprisingly, most Sages are recommended to use the stars.
QUEST_20161005_004530	There are problems when using the stars as well.{nl}There are issues when connecting the wizards to stars far away and also to stars that can't be seen.
QUEST_20161005_004531	In practicality however, Sages can easily utilize stars even if they aren't skilled if they select to rely on the power of the Goddess that controls that star.
QUEST_20161005_004532	As can be seen by this fact, Sages also rely on the Blessing of the Goddesses in order to use magic just like Pyromancers.
QUEST_20161005_004533	The Goddess' Abode of Mount Monderor Volume I
QUEST_20161005_004534	The Goddess' Abode disappeared during the rule of King Jeromel the 2nd.{nl}More than 300 years after the foundation of the Kingdom, there are still many Goddesses and enemies that we don't even know about. As such, they would not have had any clues to which Goddess erased her traces at that time.
QUEST_20161005_004535	What is surprising is that despite the Kingdom's borders growing, the only Abode we know about and can approach above ground is the one at Mount Monderor.
QUEST_20161005_004536	Apart from that one, there is no history of a Goddess selecting a place for her abode that is accessible by humans.
QUEST_20161005_004537	It has been debated amongst many priests and scholars about whether the place at Mount Monderor was actually used by a Goddess.{nl}The decision was made by those that know best about the Goddesses, so I should be irrefutable.
QUEST_20161005_004538	Of course, the easiest way to reach the truth is for priests to ask their Goddess about their sister that lived at Mount Monderor.
QUEST_20161005_004539	However, as you might well be aware, the majority of prayers are focused on the well being of humanity and knowledge, not idle curiosity.
QUEST_20161005_004540	I consider it to be similar to why asking the Goddesses about our neighbor's private life is futile since it will never be answered.
QUEST_20161005_004541	Book of the Void
QUEST_20161005_004542	The book you are looking at is a literal wealth of information.{nl}However, there is not much information you will be able to gain from it other than the fact that you cannot learn from this book by reading it.
QUEST_20161005_004543	To be more precise, this book is a medium in which knowledge is stored in an otherworldly place and transfered to the Sage Master. As such, only the Sage Masters will ever be able to learn the knowledge being provided by this book.
QUEST_20161005_004544	If the person reading this book is currently walking the path of a wizard, we hope that you will return it to it's rightful owner.{nl}This book exists for only a certain moment and returns to a normal book after the next Sage Master learns from it.
QUEST_20161005_004545	Before or after that particular moment, this book may exist, but it will not have any particular meaning.
QUEST_20161005_004546	 New Inquisitor's Creed and Decree
QUEST_20161005_004547	We Inquisitors have prided ourselves to not have ever been lax in our duties even when the Goddess' were announcing their presence to you on a daily basis.
QUEST_20161005_004548	The duty of the Inquisitors has always been a heavy one as we cannot forgive those that imply that they are one with the Goddesses and have reached their authority.
QUEST_20161005_004549	Historically, the role of the Inquisitors have been about judging and settling petty disputes that arise between people due to the differences in how they view the Goddess' Blessing and not about the interactions between Goddess and human.
QUEST_20161005_004550	However, the horrid Medzio Diena occurred while I was Master and the Goddesses have disappeared making our responsibility even more important.{nl}The duty of recording and auditing the teachings of the Goddesses has become even more important after the confusion and destruction of Medzio Diena.
QUEST_20161005_004551	We have come to a state in which we now must make decisions ourselves when we had not needed to do so when the Goddesses were interacting with us.
QUEST_20161005_004552	I, the Inquisitor Master, am more overwhelmed than enthusiastic about this sudden increase in authority and reach.{nl}Even so, I shall gladly embrace these newly bestowed responsibilities and order all other Inquisitors to do the same.
QUEST_20161005_004553	This is the difference between our responsibilities and those of other priests in this era without the Goddesses post Medzio Diena.
QUEST_20161005_004554	We must prevent any discord between those of the cloth whether it be internal or external and this is the only way we will be able to stand in front of the Goddesses and humbly offer our achievements.{nl}Year 1096 of our Kingdom{nl}Inquisitor Master - Thomas Iquinostasys
QUEST_20161005_004555	Jane, who was the apprentice of Agailla Flurry, was unable to use magic.{nl}That's why she started research on how people like herself could use magic as well.
QUEST_20161005_004556	{nl}Wizards that followed in her footsteps invented Enchant Magic.{nl}It's a new branch of magic where wizards use their powers to give or extract magic from objects.
QUEST_20161005_004557	Allowing people that are unable to use magic to use magic is still a very difficult taks.{nl}That doesn't mean that we are going to give up on it.
QUEST_20161005_004558	{nl}We Enchanters are still tirelessly looking for better ways to do so through our research.
QUEST_20161005_004559	Every night, I dream of running away from a rampaging tree.{nl}I'm just watching as my husband runs to save other people.
QUEST_20161005_004560	{nl}Every time I try to stop him, I wake up.{nl}I wish I could at least stop him from going in my dreams...
QUEST_20161005_004561	I'm just thankful that Liel grew up to be such a bright and cheerful person.
QUEST_20161005_004562	You have told Curtis about the news.
QUEST_20161005_004563	What's going on? Let's finish what we've been asked first.
QUEST_20161005_004564	Beyond Pilgrim's Way is the Great Cathedral, which was built by Maven. {nl}Ruklys, Lydia Schaffen, and Agailla Flurry were all his disciples.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004565	The Great Cathedral was significantly damaged on Medzio Diena, so I wonder if people {nl}still go there. Back then, a great number of people would go there to do various rituals.
QUEST_20161005_004566	The base forms of all things are water, earth, wind, and fire, {nl}and these are controlled by the goddesses.
QUEST_20161005_004567	Goddess.{nl}As the commander that leads the knights, I hope I can protect Klaipeda myself.
QUEST_20161005_004568	Highlander Master {nl}[Douglas Black] {nl}An experienced general from the noble class who was in charge of the Royal Guards. {nl}As the leader of Highlanders, he worked up front, saving the world from chaos.
QUEST_20161005_004569	Written by Lucid Winterspoon on Year 1096 of our Kingdom{nl}I have labored long as the Chronomancer Master, but my mission has been even more complicated after Medzio Diena, 4 years ago.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004570	At first, I thought of the changes in Nheto Forest as a side effect of Medzio Diena just like the other regions.{nl}However, I have always been alert as to the possibility of using Chronomancy illegally and started searching since I felt some irregularities.{nl}I found surprising results as a result of my research, even when I was expecting some time shifts.{nl}I found that there had been considerable damage done to the time frame as well as vegetation as a result of Medzio Diena.{nl}I am worried that there may be those trying to take advantage of these issues, especially the demons.
QUEST_20161005_004571	However, finding the irregularities in Nheto Forest will become my short term mission.{nl}All I can do is to focus on my work about finding the issues and looking for a solution even if it may be too late to stop the side effects plaguing the region.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004572	Recent findings by the Vaivora have been alarming historians.{nl}There had always been a sort of unspoken consensus on the fact that Ruklys was innocent, unlike what is believed by the masses, by those who knew all the facts about the incident.{nl}However, we can see from the documents that this can now be confirmed.
QUEST_20161005_004573	{nl}The documents contain the following contents.{nl}The Fortress of the Land which was built by Ruklys had been authorized through official routes and the seal of King Kadumel had been found on the orders to utilize soldiers and materials for it's construction.{nl}The Vaivora, mages and historians have verified the seal and all the documents to be real. This means the theory that Premier Eminent had played the two main characters against each other has been proven to be true.
QUEST_20161005_004574	{nl}As the truth has been revealed, we feel that it is only right that the heroes are recognized once more and that the misconceptions spread among the masses should be altered.{nl}Even if you take into account that the aftermath of Medzio Diena is still being felt.{nl}Written by Pyromancer Master Abreh Melinn on Year 1096 of our Kingdom.

QUEST_20161005_004680	I will give you a note with what is written on the stone slate just in case.{nl}You'll be able to check what was written on it at any time.
QUEST_20161005_004681	{nl}You said that the light you last saw was...I think you said it was red?{nl}I think it may have something to do with what you said about it being the last light.
QUEST_20161005_004682	{nl}You said that the light you last saw was...I think you said it was blue?{nl}I think it may have something to do with what you said about it being the last light.

QUEST_20161005_004687	Grasp the time at which you are granted audience with the King.{nl}The guardian will appear as the King looks down upon your last light.
QUEST_20161005_004688	Now let's try to make sense of this with the words written on the stone slate.{nl}It seems as if the King is signified by the statue in the center.
QUEST_20161005_004689	{nl}If so, do you think that the twelve pillars on either side represent when you meet the King?{nl}Does it mean that you should touch the pillars?
QUEST_20161005_004690	{nl}I think we'll have to activate the pillars and statue in the correct order.
QUEST_20161005_004691	There seems to be a switch within the pillar.{nl}Do you wish to activate it?
QUEST_20161005_004692	I was in the middle of activating this switch...{nl}Do you think I should move to another pillar?
QUEST_20161005_004693	It simply says that you must prove you are of royal blood to the guardian.
QUEST_20161005_004694	{nl}It seems as if simply touching it doesn't have an effect.{nl}We should take another look at the slate.
QUEST_20161005_004695	You have finally arrived at Taniel the Second's Royal Mausoleum!
QUEST_20161005_004696	{nl}I feel as if I am finally being rewarded for our efforts...{nl}I wouldn't have been able to come this far without your help.

QUEST_20161005_004698	The Ashaq Underground Prison is the only remaining prison out of several built in the south part of King Kadumel's kingdom.{nl}Despite its connection to Ruklys Civil War and King Kadumel's tyranny, the building remains to this day as it was maintained through the years for various purposes other than a prison.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004699	 I'll start repairing the Teleportation Magic Circle
QUEST_20161005_004700	You only seem to be able to notice the strangly shaped sculpture among the Kupoles.
QUEST_20161005_004701	You cannot seem to figure out where it is used.
QUEST_20161005_004702	You feel an energy that is sufficatingly evil.{nl}Try finding Kupoles first.
QUEST_20161005_004703	You feel as if holy power is embracing you.
QUEST_20161005_004704	Savior. It feels as if the protection magic has been removed.{nl}You should go and recieve it again before going on.
QUEST_20161005_004705	I will disarm the barrier.
QUEST_20161005_004706	That is...{nl}Siute must have been turned by darkness!
QUEST_20161005_004707	{nl}Just as I had worried...{nl}That's why there was no answer!{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004708	We should at least subdue Siute.{nl}Please stand back!
QUEST_20161005_004709	We can barely tie Siute down.{nl}Please gather the other Kupoles.
QUEST_20161005_004710	You have a feeling that it will be too late if you go and gather the other Kupoles.{nl}Could there be something you can do?
QUEST_20161005_004711	Now.{nl}Please use your energy!
QUEST_20161005_004712	Goddess Dalia
QUEST_20161005_004713	Ah... I feel the presence of Laima in you.{nl}Thank you, Savior.{nl}You have purified the darkness within me with your divine energy.
QUEST_20161005_004714	{nl}We don't have a lot of time.{nl}The carving on my arm is already emitting evil energies again...
QUEST_20161005_004715	This carving is Giltine's curse.{nl}I am getting evil energies that are in contrast to my own powers.
QUEST_20161005_004716	{nl}I cannot retain my conscious when Giltine's energy fills my body.{nl}I only destroy everything in front of me with the power of chaos.
QUEST_20161005_004717	{nl}This is why I had been held here...{nl}I am feeling the evil energies fill me once more.
QUEST_20161005_004718	{nl}Please go before I can't control myself.
QUEST_20161005_004719	600 years ago, a demon had cursed this city with petrification.{nl}The people here turned to stone, including their souls.
QUEST_20161005_004720	{nl}I tried to save the city.{nl}But the demon was adament.
QUEST_20161005_004721	{nl}He said that he didn't harm either the bodies or souls of the humans.{nl}Therefore, I shouldn't be able to interfere.
QUEST_20161005_004722	{nl}Neither a goddess or a demon is allowed to interfere with humans as long as they don't harm them...{nl}That was our deal.
QUEST_20161005_004723	The demons captured me and put the curse on me with Giltine's powers.{nl}I started destroying the forests after being consumed by the power of chaos.
QUEST_20161005_004724	{nl}Only the Demon Goddess is able to control the power of chaos.{nl}My sisters made another agreement with the Demon Kings.
QUEST_20161005_004725	{nl}We agreed to give up on the petrified city...{nl}In return for myself being sealed here by Gesti, Kartas and Vaiga.
QUEST_20161005_004726	{nl}After sealing me here, they gave control of this cave to my sisters.{nl}The Kupoles have been guarding it ever since then.
QUEST_20161005_004727	It is unlikely that they would have hidden Dalia somewhere this obvious.
QUEST_20161005_004728	This seems to be a portal being used by the demons.
QUEST_20161005_004729	I'll infuse the divine energy from the Zolem Core after purifying it...{nl}Medena, please give me strength.
QUEST_20161005_004730	You demons!{nl}These are the demons that kidnapped Goddess Dalia!{nl}We will be able to pinpoint her location if we read their minds.
QUEST_20161005_004731	{nl}We can't know where District 5 is from the information we already have.{nl}I'll have to absorb their souls and read their minds that way.
QUEST_20161005_004732	{nl}Serija said that it is dangerous but...{nl}You can save me if I am consumed by darkness.{nl}We'll have to do our best before giving up.
QUEST_20161005_004733	He will soon arrive. Do not let the Kupole or Revelator enter District 5 before he arrives.
QUEST_20161005_004734	This world will be consumed by chaos when he arrives and frees the insane goddess.
QUEST_20161005_004735	I hope this will purify everything...
QUEST_20161005_004736	Dalia does not seem to be here.
QUEST_20161005_004737	A stronger force is blocking you. It is not possible to go further.
QUEST_20161005_004738	Ah... This... This feeling...
QUEST_20161005_004739	{nl}It was you...
QUEST_20161005_004740	{nl}Gesti...!
QUEST_20161005_004741	It's been a long time Dalia.
QUEST_20161005_004742	I can't believe that my minions weren't even capable of stopping maggots like these...{nl}I am embarrassed that I trusted those worthless minions.
QUEST_20161005_004743	{nl}Wait... You...
QUEST_20161005_004744	{nl}Ha, I never thought we'd be able to meet again so quickly.{nl}I hope you haven't forgotten what happened at Tenet Church?
QUEST_20161005_004745	I didn't know that we would meet here...
QUEST_20161005_004746	I was looking forward to getting my revenge for Tenet Church...
QUEST_20161005_004747	You wait right there you naive Revelator!
QUEST_20161005_004748	{nl}Dalia, I will free you.{nl}Go and destroy whatever you meet with the power of Giltine!
QUEST_20161005_004749	{nl}The Tree will become stronger with all that destruction.{nl}I shall give my life for that to happen!
QUEST_20161005_004750	Guardian Kupoles of the cave... {nl}Please answer my call...
QUEST_20161005_004751	How could this be!{nl}Has... has the curse been removed?{nl}This can't be...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004752	Gesti.{nl}You shall kneel in front of the power of the Goddesses.
QUEST_20161005_004753	I... Do you think that I'll simply kneel before you?!
QUEST_20161005_004754	Savior... I shall focus all of my power into the Divine Orb.{nl}Please defend me from Gesti while I do so.
QUEST_20161005_004755	The Revelator was no match for me even though it wasn't for lack of trying...
QUEST_20161005_004756	{nl}Dalia, it seems that you've merely regained temporary consciousness.{nl}I will continue to bathe you in the Giltine's energy until you succumb!
QUEST_20161005_004757	{nl}I won't stop until you have lost all sense of self and are entirely consumed!
QUEST_20161005_004758	Gesti...{nl}Bow before the power of your owner.
QUEST_20161005_004759	Wh...What?!{nl}How can you use the powers of Giltine!
QUEST_20161005_004760	Kupoles...{nl}Go back to your locations.
QUEST_20161005_004761	This is my last order.{nl}Please honor it.
QUEST_20161005_004762	Thank you Medena.{nl}You have gone through much in order to protect me thus far.
QUEST_20161005_004763	{nl}You even managed to call a Savior...{nl}Laima must have forseen all of this.
QUEST_20161005_004764	Savior, I thank you.{nl}I was able to undo some of my previous wrongdoings thanks to your efforts in purifying the chaos that surrounded me.
QUEST_20161005_004765	{nl}However, this is not the end of the adventure.{nl}You are destined for much greater deeds than this in the future...
QUEST_20161005_004766	{nl}So please, leave Gesti to me.
QUEST_20161005_004767	Just listen to you talking nonsense.
QUEST_20161005_004768	Gesti...Do you remember what you told me earlier...
QUEST_20161005_004769	{nl}You said that you would gladly give your life...
QUEST_20161005_004770	{nl}All preparations are complete.{nl}You shall die with me here.
QUEST_20161005_004771	It seems as if the demons are growing even more violent.
QUEST_20161005_004772	I hope the Goddess is still safe...{nl}I really do...
QUEST_20161005_004773	I can't believe that the Kupoles have become so weakened...
QUEST_20161005_004774	Even Serija has been captured by the demons...
QUEST_20161005_004775	I do at least feel a bit better now that I have seen her.
QUEST_20161005_004776	We have finally arrived at the place where Goddess Dalia is.{nl}I hope she is okay...
QUEST_20161005_004777	Even the Kupoles have trouble meeting Dalia without protection magic.
QUEST_20161005_004778	The demons have kidnapped Goddess Dalia!{nl}I saw them with my own two eyes!{nl}There were three of them!
QUEST_20161005_004779	Serija... She is wounded...{nl}We need to find her!{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004780	Goddess Dalia seems to have regained consciousness... I haven't seen her like this for a long time...
QUEST_20161005_004781	It sounds like the screams of Serija!{nl}Something must have happened!
QUEST_20161005_004782	Please tell me as soon as you are prepared.
QUEST_20161005_004783	Leave the lower levels to the Tala Tribe.
QUEST_20161005_004784	Now, the day of total destruction will come upon us.
QUEST_20161005_004785	We demons will free the goddess from her seal.
QUEST_20161005_004786	We shall take the goddess.
QUEST_20161005_004787	You must not allow humans or Kupoles to come to District 5 where the goddess is.
QUEST_20161005_004788	This voice... Medena... it's Medena.{nl}Are you nearby?
QUEST_20161005_004789	Savior...{nl}Savior, I have a favor to ask of you.{nl}This will most likely become my last request...
QUEST_20161005_004790	{nl}Please lead the Kupoles as far away from the Tevhrin Stalactite Cave as you can...{nl}There is not much time left.{nl}I will lose consciousness soon...
QUEST_20161005_004791	Soon, a great evil will arrive at the Tevhrin Stalactite Cave.{nl}Considering the strength of the energy... Kartas... or Gesti...
QUEST_20161005_004792	{nl}Whomever it may be, one of the demon lords are coming towards Tevhrin Stalactite Cave.{nl}I will soon be consumed by the power of chaos at this rate.
QUEST_20161005_004793	{nl}Then they will free me from the seal.{nl}What happens next will be... death and destruction...
QUEST_20161005_004794	{nl}So please... Go as far away as possible.{nl}Far enough away so that I will not be able to find you...
QUEST_20161005_004795	Ah... That...
QUEST_20161005_004796	{nl}Saule... an divine orb with Saule's powers...{nl}Perhaps that will be good enough...
QUEST_20161005_004797	{nl}If I can use my powers along with the divine orb with Saule's powers, I will be able to face the Demon Kings.{nl}However, I will have to maintain consciousness while resisting the power of chaos.
QUEST_20161005_004798	{nl}The curse is solidifying it's grasp on me once more.{nl}The many evil statues that the demons installed here and there while I was kidnapped...
QUEST_20161005_004799	{nl}They are adding even more energy to the power of the curse.{nl}I will prepare for the battle with the Demon Kings.
QUEST_20161005_004800	{nl}So please destroy the statues for me.{nl}This will allow me to be able to resist the power of chaos until I fight the Demon Kings...
QUEST_20161005_004801	The monsters here will have seen the demons hide the goddess.
QUEST_20161005_004802	I thought so... The Tala Tribe knew about the whereabouts of the goddess.
QUEST_20161005_004803	The Demon Kings... Do you think we'll have the power to face them?
QUEST_20161005_004804	Divine power this strong...{nl}It isn't any weaker than the energy of the Demon Kings I felt earlier!
QUEST_20161005_004805	There is no time to lose.{nl}The magical core should be enough to open the road.{nl}Let's go!{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004806	Goddess Dalia... Do you hear me?
QUEST_20161005_004807	Do you think this will end with my death?{nl}That is pathetic.
QUEST_20161005_004808	{nl}Kartas will tear your souls apart.{nl}You will regret not dying at my hands!
QUEST_20161005_004809	It's lucky that we at least found the demon's portal now.
QUEST_20161005_004810	The road has opened!{nl}Let's go to District 2 of Tevhrin Stalactite Cave!
QUEST_20161005_004811	Revelator...{nl}You and I have such a long and tenuous relationship!
QUEST_20161005_004812	{nl}I will end you for good this time!
QUEST_20161005_004813	Only a soul remains shining where Dalia stood.
QUEST_20161005_004814	Savior, you will save Dalia and Tevhrin Stalactite Cave.{nl}Just like Dalia's prophecy.
QUEST_20161005_004815	Good luck.
QUEST_20161005_004816	Who are you?{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004817	Do you have business here?
QUEST_20161005_004818	You cannot seem to find Lina.{nl}It seems as if she has gone to install supplements elsewhere.
QUEST_20161005_004819	You should try organizing what you have heard.
QUEST_20161005_004820	What are your thoughts on the leaves you've seen?{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004821	You think that it was balanced due to the struggle between the two of us?{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004822	I had never thought about that...
QUEST_20161005_004823	Balance...{nl}That makes sense.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004824	Although I did ruin Lina's work, I never stopped her from doing anything.{nl}I always interrupted her work after she started it.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004825	Maybe it was just the right timing to stop anything from dying?
QUEST_20161005_004826	I thought that we were causing trouble for the refugees.{nl}Whatever the case, we fought in front of the humans even when we should have been adhering to the will of the Goddesses.
QUEST_20161005_004827	{nl}However, I thought that protecting the forest was the way to protect the refugees here.
QUEST_20161005_004828	There doesn't seem to be anything special about the leaves even if their colors are quite vibrant.
QUEST_20161005_004829	You cannot see the growth rings outside of the stump.
QUEST_20161005_004830	You have already checked this stump.
QUEST_20161005_004831	What happened to the forest...{nl}I'm glad that the vegetation isn't overgrowing anymore but...
QUEST_20161005_004832	I am worried since there are less herbs for us to use...{nl}There are herbs that can only be gathered during autum, but each herb has it's own use.
QUEST_20161005_004833	Of course, it's beneficial in the short term since we have more wood to fell.{nl}However, there will be no more trees at this rate.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004834	Trees don't grow during autum you see.
QUEST_20161005_004835	I wonder when I'll be able to get the report I requested...{nl}I have to report to the Chronomancer Master after reading it.
QUEST_20161005_004836	Thank you so much for helping.{nl}I was able to finish the experiments much faster thanks to your help.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004837	Now I will be able to help the Chronomancer Master find a solution to solve this region's problems.
QUEST_20161005_004838	There doesn't seem to be anything here
QUEST_20161005_004839	It seems that you have collected another page.{nl}This... You seem to be able to make out what is written on it. Take it to Kostas?
QUEST_20161005_004840	The leaves aren't falling even when the trees are shaking.
QUEST_20161005_004841	Here, take this.{nl}I was able to finish it quickly thanks to your help.
QUEST_20161005_004842	You'll be able to find nearby objects with divine energy by using this.
QUEST_20161005_004843	What was on the written orders?
QUEST_20161005_004844	What happened to the investigation?{nl}We have to find it before the demons do...
QUEST_20161005_004845	I see you've safely retrieved the third clue!{nl}Thank you!{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004846	Did you say that you've managed to get the new orders??{nl}Let's see...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004847	I think it's only a bit different from the previous one.{nl}It says that it should be retrieved from Diena instead of Gesti.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004848	What do you think happened? The orders to retrieve them from different demons...
QUEST_20161005_004849	Are you saying that they are having an arguement between themselves?{nl}A demon that has issues with Gesti...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004850	Demon lord Diena is one of the four commanders of Gesti.{nl}I can't believe that she'd argue with Gesti...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004851	What do you think could have happened?{nl}Do you think this has anything to do with it?
QUEST_20161005_004852	Diena
QUEST_20161005_004853	You...?
QUEST_20161005_004854	{nl}Ah, you must be the Revelator that has been interrupting our work here.{nl}I trust you'll understand if I don't wish to greet you.
QUEST_20161005_004855	{nl}If you are trying to find traces of Ausrine here, you're too late.{nl}Where are the traces that you've taken?{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004856	I... I need them.{nl}Hand them over.
QUEST_20161005_004857	Me?{nl}What am I doing here?
QUEST_20161005_004858	{nl}You...{nl}The Revelator?
QUEST_20161005_004859	{nl}Ah... I remember a little now.{nl}I was born a fairy and lived protecting humans...
QUEST_20161005_004860	{nl}The last memory as a fairy was of Gesti appearing in front of me before Medzio Diena.{nl}I became a Demon Lord and... I wish that I had no recollection... 
QUEST_20161005_004861	{nl}There must have been a trace of my old self within me...{nl}Maybe this was Gesti's curse...
QUEST_20161005_004862	{nl}I wanted to go back to my life as a fairy...{nl}I required the power of Ausrine to do that...
QUEST_20161005_004863	{nl}That's why I tried to gather all of the traces before they went into Gesti's hands...{nl}However, I shall give you these traces.
QUEST_20161005_004864	{nl}Somebody is coming.{nl}Take these while I have a bit of my former self.
QUEST_20161005_004865	{nl}I do not require them any more...
QUEST_20161005_004866	Ugh, you again.{nl}I want to start attacking you at once when I think of our last meeting...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004867	But I've come to do some cleaning up you see.{nl}I wont forget what I've suffered at Zachariel's Royal Mausoleum.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004868	You shall die to my powers one day.
QUEST_20161005_004869	I've told Deadborn as well, but bring the traces to me before sending them to Gesti.

QUEST_20161005_004879	Castle Dungeon (Recommended Lv : 290){nl}Only you and your party members can enter together.{nl}Do you want to enter?
QUEST_20161005_004880	This is from before there was a large statue in Fedimian.{nl}Of course, there was a small statue even then.
QUEST_20161005_004881	In any case, the fact that one could lose money by dropping it on Fedimian soil {nl}has made Fedimians very careful in handling their money.
QUEST_20161005_004882	 Modestas admitted defeat and said he'd pay him pay back. As he was leaving the place with wagon in tow, the old alchemist broke into a strange smile that caught Modestas' attention.
QUEST_20161005_004883	 Unbelievably, the piece of lead turned into gold in front of Modestas after a flash of suspicious light. 
QUEST_20161005_004884	 Modestas knew these gambles were more than just about money. {nl}Modestas, a dedicated gambler, nodded along with the woman's words. He clearly looked to be a man with a huge burden, his facial expression dark. {nl}The old woman could sense Modestas' thoughts, so she made this proposal.
QUEST_20161005_004885	[Since you seem to be worrying about how to move this boulder, what about this?{nl}I usually don't change the deal, but I'll make a special offer to add some fun.{nl}How about seeing if I can move this boulder on to your cart?{nl}You'll be able to receive help moving the boulder even if you lose the bet.]{nl}Modestas nodded in agreement since the deal seemed fair.{nl}However, the old woman started talking as soon as she saw him nod.
QUEST_20161005_004886	When Modestas asked about the condition, the old woman answered.{nl}'You are to take the boulder, which I will load onto the wagon, to Klaipeda. Then, turn it into an object of value which everyone will recognize and esteem. If you are successful, then the punishment for losing the bet against me will become void. Your friends will not disappear. Although this is difficult, I will still give you one more chance since you've already lost the bet. How about it?'{nl}Like always, Modestas had no choice.
QUEST_20161005_004887	The moment Modestas agreed to the proposal, the old woman pointed her finger past him. {nl}Modestas turned around and to his surprise, the boulder he had trouble with was effortlessly placed on the wagon. By the time Modestas looked forward again, the old woman had already disappeared. {nl}
QUEST_20161005_004888	Because Modestas had no ropes or equipment to secure the boulder onto the wagon, he had to lean the wagon and carefully drive it to Klaipeda. {nl}On his way to Klaipeda, he again met the soldiers who he had earlier bet against. Their commanding officer was now aware of what had happened thus far, and wanted to apologize to Modestas for getting him caught up and hurt in his subordinates' affairs. {nl}
QUEST_20161005_004889	The officer offered him help as soon as he heard that Modestas would be moving the boulder to Klaipeda.{nl}The officer and his men secured the boulder with strong ropes to prevent it from falling off and said that he would accompany him to Klaipeda.{nl}Modestas thanked the soldiers and accepted their offer. 
QUEST_20161005_004890	Modestas met the alchemist on the way to Klaipeda.{nl}He gave the gold bar since a promise was a promise.{nl}The alchemist started talking to Modestas as he seemed surprised by the fact that Modestas gave the gold bar without any resistance.
QUEST_20161005_004891	Everyone listened to them talking since they where curious about the bet.{nl}That's how they started talking about how they got involved with Modestas. The alchemist became sorry for fooling Modestas.
QUEST_20161005_004892	That's why he told Modestas that he would make arrangements to help him when he got to Klaipeda.{nl}Modestas was able to take the boulder to the center of Klaipeda and set the boulder down in the Central Plaza.
QUEST_20161005_004893	Just as the boulder was set down by the soldiers, the alchemist came with someone.{nl}The person that came with the alchemist was the famous sculpture and Dievdirbys Tesla.{nl}The alchemest started talking.
QUEST_20161005_004894	[How about sculpting a Goddess Statue with this boulder in the center of Klaipeda. I think that everyone in Klaipeda will recognize it's value if the boulder becomes a Goddess Statue. If so, I think that the conditions between yourself and the old woman will be met.]{nl}Everyone there agreed that this would be a good idea.
QUEST_20161005_004895	As news spread, everyone in Klaipeda was pleased to know a Goddess Statue was planned for their city. {nl}However, one last problem remained, asides from winning their favor. And that question was, which goddess should the statue commemorate? {nl}The soldiers who gave help transporting the boulder were especially passionate about this issue, and began quarrelling again. {nl}
QUEST_20161005_004896	The person to solve this problem was none other than Modestas.{nl}He thought that even if he didn't set out to do so, he should try to organize things as he was raising a Goddess Statue in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}He realized that the Goddess had appeared in front of him in the form of an old woman and tried to let the other people know of this fact.{nl}The people decided to believe Modestas and the Goddess Statue was allowed to be made.
QUEST_20161005_004897	When the Goddess Statue was finally complete, the people of Klaipeda were curious to see which Goddess would stand in the center of their beloved city.{nl}However, they were alarmed to see that they could not recognize who the Goddess was. 
QUEST_20161005_004898	The Dievdirbys who had sculpted the statue had already vanished deep into the Kateen Forest, so the citizens of Klaipeda repeatedly questioned Modestas for her name. {nl}Despite the numerous questions, nobody received an answer from Modestas. {nl}At any rate, this is the story of how the Goddess Statue of Klaipeda came to be. Even now that statue stands in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004899	And so, some people believed Modestas, having undertaken the goddesses' intervention, was an honest man who did not gamble. In reality, Modestas didn't stop making gambles until his death. {nl}
QUEST_20161005_004900	Since that time, whenever Modestas took on a wager, he always bet the same thing. The answer to the question of who the Statue of Klaipeda honored.{nl}To uncover the name of the goddess, numerous people challenged Modestas to a bet.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004901	However, Modestas didn't lose a bet even under the most dire circumstances. Therefore, many years passed without anyone learning the truth about the Goddess Statue.{nl}Modestas passed away undefeated, but never betting again after that incident.
QUEST_20161005_004902	People were finally able to learn that the Goddess Statue in Klaipeda was meant to be Goddess Ausrine.{nl}Goddess Ausrine took betting away from a man's life, but she also created a interesting mystery and a Goddess Statue in the middle of Klaipeda.

QUEST_20161005_004907	 The last procedure to be included in this part 1 is how to transmute one type of wing to another. The possibilities are wider than the previous two. Even I, the author of this book, cannot fully categorize them all. The procedure is like the following.{nl}{nl} 0 | x | x | 0 {nl} x | 0 | 0 {nl} 0 | x | x | 0 {nl}

QUEST_20161214_005014	A long time ago, the Creator ordained unto us our duty, and a disharmony of opposing ideas emerged.{nl}Countless eras have since passed.{nl}

QUEST_20170313_005503	{nl}Anyway, if you keep carrying them around like that, they'll be hard to read later on when you need them.{nl}Let me have a look.

QUEST_20170313_005537	The 16th of X {nl} - {nl} I got a stomachache drinking soup that I didn't know already went bad. {nl} I double-checked the smell before eating it, but there was no bad odor. {nl}I felt horrible inside so I went to the well for water.

QUEST_20170313_005538	I've been throwing up a lot lately but it seems to be getting better now. {nl}Tomorrow I'm going to go see Mr. Gordon to get some medicinal herbs. {nl} My little sister still hasn't come back yet. When I go to her room, I find no clothes. Even Mr. Raman is getting worried.

QUEST_20170313_005540	I was just about to go gather a few more materials before heading to Orsha.{nl}Oh, but...
QUEST_20170313_005541	{nl}What are those notes you're carrying?{nl}They look a bit... damaged.
QUEST_20170313_005542	{nl}They're going to rip and fall off if you keep carrying them like that.{nl}I do have a few leather strings that are a little too short to use on scriptures...
QUEST_20170313_005543	Since you were so kind to find me leather string and paper for my scriptures, this time I'm repaying the favor.{nl}Here you go.
QUEST_20170313_005544	{nl}This should keep your notes from ripping apart.
QUEST_20170313_005545	Are you taking good care of that... diary, was it?{nl}The one I binded?ܦor you.{nl}I can't wait to see the day where all my scriptures are also completed.
QUEST_20170313_005546	That book, though... it says Andale Village... What is it?{nl}That's the village where I used to live...
QUEST_20170313_005547	This is... my brother's diary...{nl}...

QUEST_20170313_005552	... I just don't want to talk... Not right now...
QUEST_20170313_005553	Our headman said Andale was one of seven villages founded a long time ago.{nl}The region is said to have been found by a hunter who got lost. In this region, people built a beautiful shrine along with the seven villages.
QUEST_20170313_005554	{nl}The villages shared a stream of clear water that turned the moss and the trees into beautiful colors...{nl}But one elder in Andale Village was suspicious of this color-changing water.
QUEST_20170313_005555	{nl}The people of Andale did not drink from the stream and gathered their water from a well.{nl}Meanwhile, all the other villages drank the stream water for a long time.
QUEST_20170313_005556	{nl}The water from the stream, however, wasn't fit for drinking.{nl}One by one, people from the other villages started to fall ill.
QUEST_20170313_005557	{nl}In the end, out of the seven villages, six became impossible to live in and were abandoned.{nl}I guess these villages were all but forgotten... and Andale, too, was no longer sought by outsiders.
QUEST_20170313_005558	{nl}Now... I'm guessing Andale Village is also deserted...{nl}From what I heard after coming here, this was all a curse by Demon Goddess Giltine.{nl}
QUEST_20170313_005559	That new family that moved in...{nl}I actually never saw them.
QUEST_20170313_005560	{nl}My brother was too excited about having outsiders around and did visit them once or twice.{nl}Oh, now that I think of it... Wow...
QUEST_20170313_005561	{nl}Every time we made a ceremony to the goddesses, they always said they were sick and never came.{nl}Why did I not notice it then...?
QUEST_20170313_005562	{nl}The truth is, if that day I hadn't fought with my brother and left the village, the same thing would have happened to me...
QUEST_20170313_005563	My brother was a good person.{nl}He was a talented cook and, even when we short on food, he liked sharing his dishes with the neighbors.
QUEST_20170313_005564	{nl}The whole reason we fought that day was because he wanted to make porridge for the neighbors with the last few potatoes we had...
QUEST_20170313_005565	{nl}Our neighbor, Mr. Raman, was always praising my brother.{nl}He must be gone now, too... Taken by those demons...

QUEST_20170313_005570	Guess there isn't much to find other than this bowl.
QUEST_20170313_005571	I bet this is nothing.
QUEST_20170313_005572	This looks like it will be dangerous to tamper with.
QUEST_20170313_005573	Nothing interesting to see here.
QUEST_20170313_005574	Smokey Spot
QUEST_20170313_005575	Should I throw away the water from before here?
QUEST_20170313_005576	Nothing changed.
QUEST_20170313_005577	Oh...
QUEST_20170313_005578	{nl}Now that I think about it...
QUEST_20170313_005579	{nl}You're back.{nl}Is there anything else you want to know?
QUEST_20170313_005580	A long time ago, goddesses and demons made an agreement that they would not interfere with each other.{nl}One of the conditions of this pact was that demons were not allowed to murder humans.
QUEST_20170313_005581	{nl}Then, 600 years ago, Gesti placed a curse in the Roxona region.{nl}She did so under the pretext that it was in response to Ruklys' rebellion.
QUEST_20170313_005582	{nl}Goddess Dalia stood forward to help those in Roxona.{nl}The petrified city with the forgotten name...
QUEST_20170313_005583	{nl}Then, the demons appeared and brought up the agreement.{nl}They claimed that the victims had not been murdered, merely petrified, and attacked Goddess Dalia.{nl}That is how she became trapped in the curse of the demon goddess.
QUEST_20170313_005584	{nl}The curse imparted in Goddess Dalia clashed with her own divine force, forming something immensely more powerful.{nl}This left Dalia in the state you know Her as...
QUEST_20170313_005585	{nl}That is why the entire area was burned to the ground...{nl}There was nothing that could bring the goddess back to her own conscience...
QUEST_20170313_005586	{nl}So the three Demon Kings imprisoned Dalia, and the Kupoles were left to watch over Her.{nl}No other goddesses dared to interfere with the petrified city after that.
QUEST_20170313_005587	{nl}Some might criticize the goddesses for their lack of action when they hear about this.{nl}But I believe it was a reasonable choice to make at the time.
QUEST_20170313_005588	Oh no...{nl}But then, who would frame someone like that?
QUEST_20170313_005589	{nl}And why...?
QUEST_20170313_005590	The secret could have been hidden in Ruklys' memorial.{nl}The truth about the real hero who took the blame at the time, that is...
QUEST_20170313_005591	Why would Premier Eminent think of doing something like that?{nl}I ought to investigate further.
QUEST_20170313_005592	It won't be easy now that the contents of the memorial are gone.{nl}I wonder if there isn't a way to recover them...

QUEST_20170313_005685	Maybe you won't believe me, but I'm actually involved in helping the refugees.{nl}With the money I make selling my accessories, that is.
QUEST_20170313_005686	{nl}Recently, however, some merchants have been making forgeries of my products and selling them on the market.{nl}My sales have suffered because I can't compete with their fake accessories.
QUEST_20170313_005687	{nl}That makes it difficult for me to help the refugees.{nl}If only I had a sort of certificate to prove that my products are genuine.
QUEST_20170313_005688	{nl}Unfortunately only an Appraiser Master can do that, and no one has taken the position since Medzio Diena.
QUEST_20170313_005689	{nl}There's really nothing I can do about it.
QUEST_20170313_005690	I didn't realize the absence of an Appraiser Master caused so much inconvenience.{nl}I suppose it won't be solved until someone steps up to the position.

QUEST_20170313_005696	{nl}To make the order valid, we need it signed by at least three people of high authority.{nl}This could be a high-tier commander or a noble person in a position of similar power.
QUEST_20170313_005697	{nl}As a knight commander myself, I'll take the liberty of being the first to sign it.{nl}Now, as for the other two signatures...
QUEST_20170313_005698	{nl}It will be difficult for the princess' attendant to travel, not to mention he will be busy with his duties.{nl}So I told him I would pass the task onto you.{nl}What do you say?
QUEST_20170313_005699	Pricess Gaivile's Attendant

QUEST_20170313_005705	Gather the signatures of noble people and figures of authority from the southern regions of the kingdom.

QUEST_20170313_005719	Klaipeda Knight Commander Uska
QUEST_20170313_005720	The royal order smells slightly of chemicals.
QUEST_20170313_005721	The empty space between the contents of the order and the first signature looks far too wide.
QUEST_20170313_005722	The royal order looks a little suspicious.{nl}Someone ought to know about it.

QUEST_20170313_005725	Indeed, the blank space here is rather wide and it does smell of chemicals.{nl}In this day, a royal order from a successor like Princess Kaonilla...
QUEST_20170313_005726	{nl}But didn't you say you obtained this through Princess Gaivile?{nl}Then I believe this order ought to be analyzed one more time before it returns to her.
QUEST_20170313_005727	There must be someone who can have a look at the royal order.
QUEST_20170313_005728	Oh... This is the royal order Uska got to nominate me to Appraiser Master.{nl}But you say it smells like chemicals... and the gap between the lines is too wide?
QUEST_20170313_005729	{nl}That really is strange.{nl}Official royal documents are usually redacted with no spaces in between the lines, you see.{nl}To prevent them from being altered.
QUEST_20170313_005730	{nl}Let me have a better look at it.{nl}May I?
QUEST_20170313_005731	As you mentioned, the document does smell slightly of chemicals.{nl}That fact that you noticed that is quite impressive in itself.
QUEST_20170313_005732	{nl}As for the space between the contents of the order and the signature... It does look like there's something there.{nl}I can't make much of it yet for now, however.
QUEST_20170313_005733	{nl}To get a more accurate analysis I would need a special chemical.{nl}Unfortunately it's very rare... although an experienced alchemist might be able to produce some.{nl}Do you know any alchemists we could ask?

QUEST_20170313_005739	The special chemical is finished now.{nl}You should be able to see the hidden writings now.
QUEST_20170313_005740	I really want to know what you're going to use it for, but you look worried enough so I won't ask.

QUEST_20170313_005743	You got the special chemical from Vaidotas?{nl}Wow... You really are something, aren't you?
QUEST_20170313_005744	{nl}Alright, I'm going to use the chemical and see whether there is anything hidden in the royal order.
QUEST_20170313_005745	I applied the special chemical to the blank space in the order and I found something.{nl}I'm going to make a copy of the order and erase the hidden words, just in case.
QUEST_20170313_005746	I erased what was written in the black space and made a copy of the order.{nl}I think the people who signed the document should know about it too, though.
QUEST_20170313_005747	{nl}You can go and tell the Lord of Orsha first, she will know what to do about the others.
QUEST_20170313_005748	Do you mean there was something hidden in the royal order?{nl}How does one... in an official document of the kingdom...
QUEST_20170313_005749	{nl}May I know what was written in the hidden section?

QUEST_20170313_005751	{nl}Very well. I will deliver this copy of the order to the others who signed it.{nl}Make sure Princess Gaivile's attendant knows of the hidden section in the original document.

QUEST_20170420_005869	Reset Helper Kupole
QUEST_20170420_005870	We're providing stat, skill and rank reset items every day.
QUEST_20170420_005871	You already received your reset items today.
QUEST_20170420_005872	To take free will away from humans is something even the goddesses condemn.{nl}But what the Monk Master Olfas Grimm has planned, whether right or wrong, is harmful to many people and can even kill them.{nl}That is what saddens me.
QUEST_20170420_005873	The Monk Master wants to train mercenary gladiators in secret and trade them to gain control of the capital's arena. Morally, I find this hard to condone.{nl}But it seems Olfas Grimm himself believes his deeds are justified for contributing to a greater good.
QUEST_20170420_005874	Monks are different from other Cleric faiths in that they pay service to the goddesses not through their relation to Them, but through self-training.{nl}However, by breaking his deal with the Corsair Master and refusing to pay, Grimm has disregarded even the values any good business person should have.{nl}Although I do agree that, as Monk Master, keeping a promise to a pirate would do nothing but harm.
QUEST_20170420_005875	Monks believe it is right to do not what the goddesses want, but what the goddesses need.{nl}For people like Olfas Grimm, their physical training only reinforces this belief, the idea that anything is justifiable if it is for the sake of the goddesses.{nl}It came as a surprise to everyone when, without hesitation, he broke the double contract he had signed with the Schwarzer Reiter and Doppelsoeldner Masters.
QUEST_20170420_005876	Nemoken borrowed a large sum from the Monk Master in order to lure assassin Evoniphon by pretending to hire him.{nl}In the end, she could neither catch Evoniphon not return the money.{nl}This was a chance for the Monk Master to find her weakness.{nl}He may have no plans to take advantage of this weakness yet, but he surely won't forget it after they are even.
QUEST_20170420_005877	It's true that Hayraven, the Corsair Master, has become kinder after Medzio Diena forced him to return to solid ground.{nl}But that does not excuse all the crimes he commited before that.
QUEST_20170420_005878	Hayraven was always most violent when attacking other pirate ships.{nl}Many were the times when he pillaged whole merchant vessels, and to rival pirates he was particularly cruel.{nl}He did not kill those whom he captured; instead he sent them over to the Monk Master, but he never received payment for it. You can see why Hayraven isn't very fond of Olfas Grimm now.
QUEST_20170420_005879	In a way, Hayraven is someone in charge of his own destiny.{nl}In the eyes of the goddesses, he is no more important than the Great Pirate Vladslovas whom he killed.{nl}Ultimately, he turned fate in his favor out of sheer will.{nl}And perhaps a little help from his cunning nature...
QUEST_20170420_005880	Had Jurate, goddess of the sea, been a little more interested in the lives of humans, the sea would have been peaceful, with or without the royal navy.{nl}When She did come into contact with humans again, Hayraven was already on land after losing his ship.{nl}It was all due to Medzio Diena.
QUEST_20170420_005881	The only reason why the Corsair Master is not preparing to return to the sea now that the royal navy is weakened, is that there aren't as many ships sailing anymore.{nl}It may sound contradictory, but him going back to the sea would be a sign of the Kingdom returning to normal life.
QUEST_20170420_005882	Before Medzio Diena, the Corsair Master came across a few of the Doppelsoeldner Master's soldiers at sea and destroyed their ship.{nl}Guerra, the Doppelsoeldner Master, has hated him since.{nl}Both Masters aren't the type to shy away from one-on-one confrontations, but neither do they tend to get involved in anything that isn't profitable.{nl}It's hard to even say who would win if they were ever to face each other.
QUEST_20170420_005883	After Olfas Grimm broke his contract with the Doppelsoeldner Master and embezzled the money, he's been searching for legal ways to take revenge on the Monk Master.{nl}He would not be satisfied with merely having him killed.
QUEST_20170420_005884	As leaders of mercenary groups, the Doppelsoeldner and Schwarzer Reiter Masters haven't always been on good terms.{nl}But after the contract misadventure with the Monk Master, his grudge became only deeper.
QUEST_20170420_005885	Unlike the Schwarzer Reiter Master, Guerra values his group's reputation, authority, and most of all, profits.{nl}He believes these factors to be crucial when it comes to increasing their combat power and strategic expertise.
QUEST_20170420_005886	Guerra is not, in fact, the Doppelsoeldner Master's birth name.{nl}Many assume that, by adopting a new name, he was either attempting to disguise his noble ancestry due to his activities as a mercenary leader, or the opposite, his low-class origins.{nl}I do know the truth about his heritage, but I mustn't reveal a personal secret.
QUEST_20170420_005887	Warsis, the Schwarzer Reiter Master, originally descends from a family of commoners.{nl}He adopted his surname from subordinates and enemies who, astounded by his competence, gave him the nickname of Creak.
QUEST_20170420_005888	Unlike the Doppelsoeldner Master and his mercenaries, the Schwarzer Reiter Master is more akin to a war aficionado.{nl}He promotes comradeship among his mercenaries, with all profits earned benefiting both him and his subordinates.{nl}An ideal troupe to him is one of talented warriors joined together by deep comradeship and strict military discipline.
QUEST_20170420_005889	Upon learning about what happened to the subordinates he had taken over from the Monk Master, the Schwarzer Reiter Master was as furious as if he had been personally attacked himself.{nl}Since this incident, Warsis Creak despises the Monk Master, but also Hayraven and the Doppelsoeldner Master, due to what he considers a dishonest management of mercenaries.
QUEST_20170420_005890	Warsis Creak, the Schwarzer Reiter Master, is a prime figure in the military field.{nl}He is a man of astounding combat prowess and strategic technique, but also of considerable social and cultural refinement.{nl}The reason he hasn't applied for the royal army is that he believes he would be unable to experiment with and master diverse types of weapons and techniques.
QUEST_20170420_005891	As a leader with fairly liberal views, the Schwarzer Reiter Master will not hesitate to introduce new guns or other weapons to his group of mercenaries.{nl}Because of this, he is considered to be the most decent Master among the four who run mercenary troupes.
QUEST_20170420_005892	Rashua, the Swordsman Master, had dedicated his entire life to military service.{nl}Now, he merely tries to bear with the agony of witnessing the misery that has struck the kingdom.
QUEST_20170420_005893	Maria Leed, the Peltasta Master, believes that taking part in combat should earn anyone proper compensation.{nl}But most of all, to her, going to battle is a question of honor.{nl}It's one of the reasons why she remains so impassive to the Highlander Master's persuasion.
QUEST_20170420_005894	Highlander Master Douglas Black is a courteous, dignified man, as much so as the residence he inherited from the distinguished family of which he descends.
QUEST_20170420_005895	I still feel like I am in debt to Walder Junnot, the Barbarian Master, for never having had the time to really help his family.
QUEST_20170420_005896	I strongly believe we will one day live in a peaceful world where Hoplite Master Aidas Valor and his partner Flyntess can raise a family.
QUEST_20170420_005897	Kamiya, the Rodelero Master, is an outstanding soldier, but he isn't sure which army he ought to serve.{nl}I try not to interfere and instead respect his decisions.
QUEST_20170420_005898	Memet Culag, the Cataphract Master, forwent marriage to follow his own path.{nl}He may have no descendants to carry his name, but his achievements certainly will.
QUEST_20170420_005899	Justina Legwyn, the Squire Master, is the last descendant of her family. It's an unfortunate destiny, having to carry the responsibility of both those positions...
QUEST_20170420_005900	At her young age, Sorscha Hutton is already set to become the greatest Fencer Master to date.{nl}Anyone who dares to cross her path can only expect to face the cold blade of destiny.
QUEST_20170420_005901	Born to a family of commoners, Uska grew to become a general of the royal army, Knight Commander and Templar Master.{nl}His sword is respected wherever he goes, and he is as responsible as he is talented.
QUEST_20170420_005902	Valeska Himil, Dragoon Master and representative of the Himils, is set to have an important role in the future of her family.{nl}No one knows whether their spear will return to Schaffenstar or not, but  either way it's going to be a historic decision.
QUEST_20170420_005903	Shinobi Master Yura Swanjone works behind the scenes with the royal family, stealthily thwarting any forces that dare threaten the throne.
QUEST_20170420_005904	Phelixia, the Murmillo Master, does not shy away from putting her life on the line.{nl}With anything she does, however, she puts tremendous effort into making sure she is ahead and in charge of her destiny.
QUEST_20170420_005905	Noer Parecius, descendant of a great king! The throne may never belong to him, but his lance will certainly have him remembered as a king of war.
QUEST_20170420_005906	Centurion Master Krajicek is a role model to every member of the royal army.{nl}It's a shame that the current state of the army is hindering him.
QUEST_20170420_005907	I truly respect the Matador Master's outlook on life.{nl}It simply saddens me that her incredible talent and influence can be put to wrongful use in the world.
QUEST_20170420_005908	The Wizard Master used to be considered the least gifted among the magic Masters.{nl}Her current skill, however, is no lesser than that of any talented Master.{nl}I admire her effort.
QUEST_20170420_005909	I admire the vision of Abreh Melinn for finding a new point of contact between Clerics and Wizards.{nl}Who else but her would be fit for the position of Pyromancer Master?
QUEST_20170420_005910	Cryomancer Master Aleister Crowley is a very clever man. He may be loyal, but he isn't innocent, and he won't hesitate to deceive others for his own benefit. That is all I have to say about him.
QUEST_20170420_005911	Behind the appearances, Ili Terid, the Psychokino Master, hides a fragile heart and a yearning to have his genius recognized.{nl}This despite him having developed powers before he learned about magic, and being recognized as an outstanding merchant even before his powers manifested.
QUEST_20170420_005912	Winona Ende, the Linker Master, is a genius of the kind that is rare to find even among the most notable figures in magic academia.{nl}In about 170 years, she may very well surpass legends like Lucid Winterspoon or Owyn Dilven.
QUEST_20170420_005913	Larisa will only live as much as the average human being.{nl}Ultimately that is what will keep her from fully developing her genius.
QUEST_20170420_005914	Wican Celestic, the Elementalist Master, is dreaming of a love that is unattainable.{nl}The woman he loves is solely interested in eternal life and does not care for marriage.
QUEST_20170420_005915	The Sorcerer Master may still be young, but she's very concerned about aging and death.{nl}I can't say whether she's going to become an Amzinas, however.{nl}The same is true for the Oracle Master, which could be one of the reasons why Dame Circe does not care for Apolonjia.
QUEST_20170420_005916	Lucid Winterspoon has lived for many centuries, never fully retreating into solitude nor actively stepping out into the world.{nl}I respect her free will, but I do think that, like time itself, to others she is merely a flowing presence.
QUEST_20170420_005917	Loretta Nimbus is the Necromancer Master and the youngest of the Amzinas. She's chasing after  a goal that's impossible to reach.
QUEST_20170420_005918	The Alchemist Master is very concerned about carrying the reputation of the Winterspoon family, but his is a name that will not be degraded.{nl}It's a shame he seems so insecure about it.
QUEST_20170420_005919	I'm curious about the future of Warlock Master Melanie Melachim.{nl}Being constantly surrounded by demons due to her profession has caused in her a certain opacity.

QUEST_20170420_005925	Rozalija, a Siaulai native, had always dreamed of becoming a healer.{nl}It was only after Medzio Diena that she came to follow the path of Cleric Master.{nl}One of the rare positive outcomes of that tragic day.
QUEST_20170420_005926	The Krivis Master is a keeper of all the beliefs of which humans have memory.{nl}He may not be aware of this himself, but his order comprises even ancient beliefs which humans do not know.
QUEST_20170420_005927	Boruble's wish is to one day pass on the position of Priest Master to become the Chaplain Master, but first he must ask himself whether he can maintain his devotion when his life is at risk in the battlefield.{nl}Volunteering in the army would be one way to find out.

QUEST_20170420_005931	Sadhu Master Agota Hanska was the first person in this era to receive a Revelation. It was this that brought her into the path of the clerics.
QUEST_20170420_005932	Pardoner Master Mistes Goldmund is able to find a balance between that which is material and conceptual, and express in numbers a type of devotion which is unmeasurable.{nl}He may have a tendency to go too far, but I can't deny someone like him is needed in the order.
QUEST_20170420_005933	Many know Druid Master Gina Greene to be the wealthiest person in the kingdom.{nl}I, too, agree.{nl}I believe, however, considering the large savings she deposited with the Kedoran Alliance, that among her lands is Barconsi's hidden mine.{nl}Whether that is true, of course, is unknown by even Gina herself...

QUEST_20170420_005935	Kabbalists are discoverers of hidden rules and explorers of universal principles. As their leader, Libgar Hippathia is currently serving the kingdom from a lower position, although I do wish she returns to her official role someday.
QUEST_20170420_005936	Had Cleric Master Rozalija been a few years older than Plague Doctor Master Philip Aurellius, she would have been the one to take over the role.{nl}It's unfortunate, as not many people are talented in both regular healing and divine treatment as she is.
QUEST_20170420_005937	Inquisitors are the clerics which most assist the goddesses.{nl}In recent times, their leader, Thomas Iquinostasys, has taken on the unprecedented task of deciphering the true will of the goddesses with Them absent from the world we know.
QUEST_20170420_005938	Ceslovas, who could have succeeded as any kind of cleric, bravely chose the path of war priest to later become Chaplain Master, the first commoner to do so in 91 years.{nl}The role of royal Chaplains is not to pray for dying soldiers, and becoming one without the support of a noble family is something that happens as rarely as once in a century.
QUEST_20170420_005939	Taoists are a unique kind of clerics. They approach the divine not by worshiping the goddesses, but by understanding and cultivating human nature.{nl}As Taoist Master, Geuhong holds the records of all those who chose this path since times past.
QUEST_20170420_005940	If there's anything the Miko Master lacks, it's diligence.{nl}As the link that connects divine spirits with our world, it's a shame it is so.
