QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000340	First, talk to the search scout in the lower bridge of Bulvjes.{nl}This will become a tedious long term war if we miss the Vubbe fighter.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000341	So the Vubbe Fighter was the reason behind the increase of monsters.{nl}Please find out how many Vubbe Fighters there are.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000342	Under the circumstances, it makes sense that the monsters are controlled by Vubbe Fighters.{nl}But deep down, you just don't want to believe it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000343	Following your report, there are no more Vubbe Fighters in these woods.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000347	Actually, it doesn't make sense for the supply soldier to get the supplies.{nl}It should have come from Klaipeda.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000348	Thank you.{nl}Unexpected help always feels good.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000349	In fact, everything would have been fine if the Pokubus weren't around.{nl}The Pokubus were running wild and that's why were weren't able to retrieve all the supplies.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000350	I don't know why they suddenly started to prey on the supplies.{nl}Could something be commanding them?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000351	Thank you.{nl}I envy your ability.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000352	Eastern Woods Search Scout
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000353	Oh, it's you.{nl}I have heard from the operations officer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000354	A Vubbe Fighter is hiding deep in the Nudegi Felled Area.{nl}We got the orders to kill it, but it may be safer to wait for additional troops.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000355	I'm just a search scout but it was my first time to see a Vubbe Fighter up close.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000356	Awesome. You got rid of it by yourself.{nl}Go ahead and report to Sir Aras. He'll be very pleased.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000357	You mean you really killed the Vubbe Fighter?{nl}Well then, now we can be relieved since the number of monsters will no longer grow.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000358	Of course. As promised, I will grant your access to the Miners' Village.{nl}Please wait.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000359	If you find any clues, let the Operations Officer in the northern area know about it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000360	I think the Miners' Village is not in a good situation.{nl}It's too late to move the troops so you go first to support the Miners' Village.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000361	They have low IQ but these monsters build groups and live as a community.{nl}They used to appear only occasionally in the deeper areas of the mines... Could they be expanding their forces?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000362	Whatever the reason is, Vubbes expanding their territory is a big problem.{nl}Monsters that lose their territory to Vubbes will be forced to make their way into our base.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000369	I was collecting the supplies to be sent to the Miners' Village, but the monsters stole it all.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000370	The supply boxes contain dangerous explosives and collecting them is not an easy task.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000371	They couldn't have gone far.{nl}It would have been better if it just exploded on the way.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000374	I knew you would.{nl}One more thing, the ground near the Closed Area is weak so the entrance has been blocked for a long time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000375	The kidnapped people are veteran miners so they may know how to get in.{nl}Well then, may the blessings of the Goddess be with you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000376	It wasn't long ago.{nl}I felt a strange power while performing experiments in the Closed Area.{nl}It was different from the mana that we know but it was very warm.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000377	But some force did not allow me to approach, as if it had an owner already.{nl}A few days after the incident, the bishop dreamed about the evidence of salvation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000378	Perhaps the evidence of salvation is the force I felt...{nl}That's what I think.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000379	All I see are monsters and we're out of supplies.{nl}I'm also curious how the battle situation is in Miners' Village.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000380	Until I'm assigned a new task, I'm thinking of going back to my duties as a search scout.{nl}Observing the monsters, you know.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000381	The Miners' Village is under siege and entrance is prohibited for civilians.{nl}Remember that we can't guarantee your safety if you do not get my permission.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000382	You have to cheer up.{nl} Even Sir Aras is holding on.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000383	Goddess Zemyna overlooks the earth.{nl}There are rumors that the Goddess has abandoned us but that's nonsense.{nl}Her statue still shines beautifully when you pray to it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000384	Vubbes suddenly came pouring in from outside of the Siaulai Woods.{nl}That's why the Mining Village located in the middle of it turned to a battlefield.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000385	And that's why I can't permit entrance to the Miners Village. For safety reasons.{nl}Of course it will be a different story if your skill are good enough to ensure your safety even without the protection of guards.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000386	Gosh, it could have been really dangerous.{nl}That huge thing was hiding so well.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000387	It's very important to study monsters at times like this.{nl}It's like weather forecasts where you try to find out the cause and see what would happen.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000388	I'm sure the leaf bugs in Uoros farm stole it.{nl}They did steal from us once before.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000389	Send my regards to the Guard Captain when you meet him.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000390	In order to test if your skills are good enough to enter the Miners Village,{nl}I need you to help us solve a problem we have.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000391	First, take back the farm from the Pokubus.{nl}I believe this would be a fairly easy task
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000392	There seems to be a gap in the rock where you can insert something.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000393	Let's search the Bulvjes farm first.{nl}But don't chase them or something as it can be dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000394	It makes me wonder if you're an envoy of the Goddess.{nl}Anyway, the supply camp is located further below the farm.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000399	Monsters attack and steal from people who buy items from me. I think they know I can tell which items are good.{nl}I feel sorry for those who were attacked but it also proves that the items are worth it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000400	The monsters never raided into Klaipeda but with Sir Uska gone, it's hard to be at ease.{nl}You have you watch out for yourself at times like this.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000401	I want to travel with a single weapon in hand like an adventurer... But it's not that easy.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000407	I'd rather stay safe and at peace with lower sales than have sales go up because of people worrying when the monsters might attack.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000408	I sell things that people need, but I sometimes think it would've been better if I was a healer,{nl}because that way I could be closer to the explorers to help them.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000409	I hear strange howling from the distance. Could it be the sound of the monsters?

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000866	I studied the barrier of the gate but power of the basement altar will not be enough. {nl} Unless you add the power of crytal held by Corylus.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000867	Maybe the Goddess knew it'd fail and that's why she said wait for the Revelator. {nl} At least, we got the Gesti hurt so it can also be good.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000884	I'm thinking of converting the Demons using the power of the altar. {nl} The converted Demons will absorb the divine power and slowly start to die. {nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000891	You need the seal of space to enter the hidden sanctuary. {nl} It's hidden in Sventove Central Altar but i hope it's not too late.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000892	Structures in the Tenet Cathedral are placed to ward against the Demons. {nl} Each one in itself is a small barrier that contributes to a huge barrier. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000893	The most powerful barrier is in the 2nd floor. {nl} I heard that it can exert the greatest force when the divine sphere is there.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000894	Gesti made the first move. {nl} It will be difficult to approach secretly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000895	I must change the plan. {nl} First you need to go watch the movement of the Gesti. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000896	Let's start by occupying the bell tower.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000897	From here, we can see what Gesti is going to do.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000898	Alright, bring the seal of space from Sventove Central Altar. {nl} You can do it, right?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000899	You must know that the revelation is hidden in the sanctuary. {nl} The seal of the space is the only key that get you to the sanctuary. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000900	It's not just the Tenet Cathedral. {nl} You can enter all the places that the Goddess hid.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000901	The seal of space can only be used by the Revelator so you won't be able to find the revelation right away. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000902	But the enemy is the Demon King. Even the Paladin Master couldn't defeat him.{nl}I should use the power of Broken Altar.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000903	We can't do anything about the destroyed altar but the fragments still have power. {nl} Gather the pieces and insert it in the 8 pillars of the Sventove Central Hall.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000904	When you are done, I will be able to tie up Gesti through the power of the divine crystal and the church. {nl} It may be for a short while but that's the best option we have.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000905	So you activated the Malda altar? {nl} Now it will be safe to stay here for the time being. Good work.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000908	Good job. {nl} When this is over, I should gather all brothers and drive them away at once.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000909	I'll ring the bell and let you know when the Gesti show up so have a safe trip on your way.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000910	So you found the seal of space. {nl}Use the seal on the pillar beside me to go to the sanctuary. {nl} It is prepared for the Revelator only.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000911	May the blessings of the Goddess be with you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000912	So Gesti just ran away. {nl} Fine. Since you got the revelation, we've completed the mission. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000913	
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000914	When you find the revelation, tell Mater Paladin of the story you've been through so far. {nl} May the blessings of the Goddess be with you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000915	Seems like Gesti did not notice yet. {nl}Better prepare the divine crystal.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000916	All the preparations made. {nl} Barriers of the church will soon weaken the Gesti. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000917	The weakened Gesti will be enough for you to handle. {nl} When the Gesti is cornered, I will make the final strike with the divine sphere.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000918	This is a piece of Mazas shelter barrier. {nl} Do not worry. {nl} There are ways to recover the barrier so I'm sure it will be alright.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000919	I didn't know the Demons will use the summoner to come across here. {nl} Better get rid of them all before they seige us.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000920	Even with so many Demons, you still managed to make it through. {nl} You may be the Revelator, but that's still impressive. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000921	It's the revelation. {nl} Cherish it and do not show it to anyone else. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000922	Come on. Go to the Paladin Master. {nl} He will tell you the way you must go.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000923	I asked my precious friend Algis for Tenet Church. {nl} I won't lose to Gesti but it is important to have some back up plan just in case.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000924	
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000925	In the kingdom, there are several valuable weapons aside from this divine sphere. {nl} Those weapons saved many lives on the Medis Diena four years ago.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000926	From now on, I will focus on the divine crystal. {nl} In the meanwhile, please use your skills so that I won't be disturbed.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000927	I'm sorry. It's all my fault. {nl}The Gesti found out the divine heal is not the revelation so it will head straight to the church. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000928	But his old body of mine does not follow my will anymore. {nl} Now I can only trust my old friend Algis and you. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000929	
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000930	It is too much for me to handle alone without any help from other brothers. {nl} I'd better run the Malda Altar. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000931	
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000932	We still have a lot to do here.{nl}The goddess told us to never give up.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000933	The world still needs more experience. {nl} We probably wouldn't have made it this far without the help of the Goddess.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000934	The activation of tree guard post is taking longer than I thought. {nl} We have no time, let's use a Demon's soul instead.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000935	All souls are pure. {nl} So even if it's a Demon's soul, it can still provide some divine power.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000936	Oh the Tree guard post was filled with soul of the Demon. {nl} It still needs some final touches to complete but I'll take care of it. {nl}Great job.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000937	It's amazing you can use the barrier like that. {nl} Even the Paladins did not know about that. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000938	
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000939	Standing against this much enemies itself is a great deal. {nl} It's all thanks to the Paladin Master.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000940	Even though he's still young, Kenneth is amazing. {nl}I think we can entrust him a little more.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000944	I can't do anything since Sidmias are attacking us.{nl}Can you defeat them?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000945	Those Sidmias want me to put my head on that flower bud.{nl}It's not good at all.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000947	According to the elders, we are done with those Pantos.{nl}We can't continue the relationship anymore.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000948	This barrier is impossible to open from the inside. {nl} Fortunately, the entrance to the basement looks safe. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000949	However, it's too dangerous to in the basement with the divine sphere. {nl} I'll wait here so you go to the 1st floor through the basement and open the barrier. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000950	You have done what other can't easily do.{nl}The goddess must be proud of you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000951	My faith in religion is strong enough to destroy those demons, but the reality isn't that simple.{nl}I hope you help us a bit.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000952	
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000953	Get rid of the Demons around the tree guard barrier. {nl} The souls of the Demons will be able to fill the divine powers a little. Thanks!
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000954	Very good. Those flowers on the ground will be enough.{nl}Don't you think so?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000955	We are the people following the Paladin Master.{nl}We will defeat the people who disobey the goddess.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000956	Everyone has their reasons for following him.{nl}Some of them received benefits from him and some of them were already Paladins like Algis.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000957	Maybe the goddess knew it would happen and that's why she waited for the savior.{nl}I feel like I put a big burden on your shoulders.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000958	
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000959	This is the plan that was carried on for hundreds of years since the first Paladin.{nl}We should never fail this plan.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000983	Explosion, that was too dangerous.{nl}Let's find a safer way to destroy it.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000985	The research materials should be here somewhere..
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000986	This is it. Now I think I know how to break those valves.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000987	Let's go find the last valve at the central control room.{nl}When we destroy this, we will be safe no matter what Antares does.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000988	Please set this stone and defeat the monsters around.{nl}We can collect the energy to recharge the barrier device.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000989	A suitable end for a crazy magician.{nl}It could have been dangerous without defensive magics.{nl}We may have touched it without knowing the first valve was destroyed..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000990	Anyways, that's good.{nl}The tower is now safe, so let's go up.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000991	Ah, that's right. Let's also prepare defensive magics in case something happens.{nl}There was a magic written in Antare's materials that we can use when there are explosions.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000992	
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000993	Good. We can use it one more time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000994	Let's go find the second valve on the central control room.{nl}If we can destroy it, we will be safe no matter what Antares does.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000995	The Jewel of Prominence is somewhat strange.{nl}Something must have gone wrong when Antares exploded a while ago.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000996	Let's check the status while we defeat the monsters with the Jewel of Prominence.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000997	What is happening to the Jewel of Prominence?{nl}It is very instable.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000998	Did you just see that monster exploding?{nl}It's definitely strange. It seems as if the power of essence is going crazy.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000999	And me.. I feel dizzy..
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_001000	If we stay like this, the Jewel of Prominence may break.{nl}There must be a stabilizing device somewhere here. Let's go.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_001001	By the way, how do I know about the stabilizing device?{nl}I've never been to the 4th floor..
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_001002	Okay.. My memories keep coming back..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_001003	Ah, the stabilization has come to an end.{nl}I am okay. It's nothing. Just old memory coming back.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_001004	The Jewel of Prominence has stopped going crazy.{nl}But, in order to fully stabilize it, we need the Essence of Flame from the fireplace at the middle of the tower.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_001005	It's almost done. Yes..
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_001006	You gathered everything.{nl}Give them to me. Including the Jewel.{nl}I know the way to fully stabilize it so let's go to the lab room.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_001007	I hope the device is okay..
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_001008	Good! We can activate the device now.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_001014	All other magicians either died or ran away.{nl}You are our last hope. Let's go in.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_001015	Gabija did not hide herself.{nl}She just coudnl't come forward because she had to protect the tower from demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_001016	I heard Agailla Flurry went because she coun't find a successor. {nl}I heard it was for something important.. But I don't know what it is.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_001022	As a follower of the great Flurry, I can't back away yet!

QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006955	A very ominous voice is looking for you.{nl}Please be careful...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006956	I never thought I would meet someone other than a believer here which is full of thorny bushes and the monsters.{nl}It would be hard without the protection of the goddess. Don't you think so, Revelator?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006957	So you are the revelator. The believers are having a hard time due to the thorny bushes.{nl}How about you help them...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006958	The evil force was first felt in Kvailas Forest. {nl}The force was very strong so it will remain this way for a while even if you get rid of Bramble.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006959	The evil force of Kvailas Forest is becomeing stronger but our followers are becoming weak. {nl}I am worried that we may lose to the evil. I hope the revelator was with us...

QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006971	It's too selfish to seek for the salvation now.{nl}Exhausted. It may be better to eliminate Akorn with me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006972	Salvation... Would I be able to have hope.{nl}Then, I will count on you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006973	You gotta find a way to block the magical power that will be injected with the magical stone of the interaction.{nl}If we could find the documents that Balryus left at Beiniki Prayer's Room, it may not be a meaningless dream...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006974	Salvation... That's the word that I forgot for a long time. I thought hope was extravagant.{nl}All I could do was just depress for a long time.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006975	Okay. Was the document present?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006976	Magic generating stones.{nl}They are at the room of senses and the room of rituals.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006977	I know the basic composition. I've researched it when I was alive.{nl}But, it won't react if it's not Balryus magical power.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006978	You can find the artifacts of Balryus from Bebaiki chamber.{nl}The magical power would still be there since Balryus was a great magician.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006979	I am sure the magical power still remains.{nl}There's no other way so I hope it still exists.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006980	It's fortunate that the magical power still remains.{nl}First, let's stop the magic generating stone near the room of senses.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006981	I hid the magic generating stones among the fakes in the room of senses.{nl}But, with the brooch you found, you will be able to distinguish the real ones from the fakes.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006982	Keep this in mind. Pick out the real magic generating stones and stop the magical power.{nl}If you touch on the fakes, all magic generating stones will be activated again.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006983	I felt earnestness for the first time in hundreds of years.{nl}To prevent it from ending meaninglessly, I will pray to the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006984	The magical power that came from the room of senses has completely disappeared.{nl}Now, we just have to block the room of rituals.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006985	The room of rituals is slightly different from the room of senses.{nl}Although, they are the same that you have to shut down the magical power of all magic generating stones.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006986	You will know how to handle it when you control it yourself.{nl}But, if you feel something went wrong, use the magical power of Balryus.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006987	With the warp magic field under me, you could quickly go to the room of rituals.{nl}I hope you are successful...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006988	The magic generating stones in the room of rituals affect the other magic generating stones nearby.{nl}We could start over with Balyus' magic.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006989	The magical power that was supplied to the magical stone of the interaction has been completely shut off... {nl}Do you think we can really wish for the salvation.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006990	We are all ready. But, that Akorn is different from the Akorn from your era. {nl}It may be better to leave it like that.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006991	We have an other way. The sealed artifact among Balryus artifacts...{nl}I heard there are some of them in Uzdaromo stone chamber that were created to suppress the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006992	I already gave up the hope that I would be free a few hundreds years ago.{nl}In fact, I still can't believe it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006993	The seal that is suppressing the demonic energy... that's it.{nl}Now everything is ready.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006994	Now, when the magical stone of the interaction stops, I will be free with Akorn.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006995	I will tell you one more time. You should not think of Akorn that was present in your era.{nl}It will be hard without using the seal.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006996	In fact, I am okay even if I disappear like this.{nl}It's so thankful that you care for me, but I don't want you to get hurt.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006997	We are almost at the moment of being released from the restraint that was on us for hundreds of years.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006998	I can be saved. I... finally...{nl}I can't thank you enough.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_006999	I will now leave to the goddesses.{nl}Thank you. Thank you so much...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007000	How's going?{nl}We can alleviate the strange energy in this region when we enhance the magic field.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007001	If I only had little more time...{nl}My documents... I can't leave them...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007002	The objects are useless to me now...{nl}Okay. Maybe you... My documents at Dykyne Crossroad...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007003	I don't have regrets anymore... but, be careful about that man.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007004	Let's see, while I am cleaning this...{nl}I am sorry, but while I am bringing the brush and the tools for the rubber copy, can you take care of the tombstone at Gritis Hall?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007005	Will be wandering when the string of the destiny disconnects...{nl}It must mean Laima Goddess... But there's a rumor that she appeared... It's complicated.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007006	When someone borns with a gold spoon, life will be good.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007007	{nl}What, what the hell...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007008	It's too soon to be disappointed.{nl}When I went to Vegio Cliffs, there was one more tombstone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007009	But, it seems that the ink won't be smeared due to the mosses.{nl}The juice of Crout Grass will solve it. I forgot to bring it when I came back.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007010	Don't accept the forecasts of the oracles as the foresight of the future.{nl}Sometimes, they could help us determine what's right and wrong as we live on.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007011	Was it difficult? But, you will soon know.{nl}You will soon find the clue that would solve the interwined world.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007012	When you find all the grass juice of Crouts, rub them onto the tombstones at Vegio Cliff until the mosses rub out.{nl}It is famous for having the smell that lures the monsters... I do have a good assitant.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007013	You will see the effects right away when you rub the grass juice on it, but you should leave it for a while.{nl}The mosses will go away.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007014	It wasn't effective? I guess the moss is not normal.{nl}Hmm. Then I guess I should ask Bidotas. There must be some way.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007015	Okay then I will go. {nl}Ah, can I ask you to get the bone powders of monsters?{nl}I need something sticky that would help the ink to be smeared well.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007016	Luckily, Bidotas gave me a good one.{nl}I heard you should use this special ink with the sticky liquid.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007017	Okay. I want you to do the last rubber copy with this.{nl}My legs ache since I travelled too far...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007018	I have a good feeling about this.{nl}Don't you think we may be able to find decent forecast this time?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007019	The world for the death of the death also would exist
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007020	{nl}Death after death? This... This may be the forecast that I was looking for.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007021	I should research more on this forecast. {nl}Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007022	While I am interpreting this, I will give you the rope with a magnet so please go to the well with that.{nl}I saw a gold plate on the floor. If that's the plate, it will come up after being attached.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007023	There's no strange reason.{nl}The people used to live here even before the empire was built here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007024	A small village becomes a big village and then a city...{nl}And then it will be forgotten.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007025	I told you a while ago, but if possible, I would have pulled it out.{nl}Please beware of the surroundings near you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007026	Difficult, difficult...{nl}The words are hard to understand.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007027	I guess it was the gold plate.{nl}It was lucky that the well was dried... If not, it could have been horrible.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007028	I will organize them and show you later.{nl}You are the revelator. They will help your journey to find the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007029	It seems that the gold plates that you've brought can't be worked due to the rusts.{nl}Why did they record on the gold plate...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007030	In fact, I didn't know what this gold plate was.{nl}Since this place is the hometown of Demetrius, I came here expecting something may be present.{nl{
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007031	Nothing was engraved on it, rather it was full of rusts.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007032	At then, my eyes were ignited with flame.{nl}Demetrius has something to tell you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007033	Yes. Now is not the time to just complain. First, I should make the rust remover.{nl}I want you to obtain the inner core of Hallowbenter Magician.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007034	Get rid of the rusts with the rust remover and maintain it with the anticorrosive agent. {nl}If it weren't you, I wouldn't have done it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007035	Fast indeed.{nl}Okay. I will make the acidic solution with this. It will become the basis of the rust remover.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007036	Secondly, when we sprinkle the rust powders, some monsters react.{nl}Collect some boiling liquid from that monster. A lot of it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007037	Ah. If you sprinkle it too much, it may endure all the monsters nearby.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007038	I went to meet Alchemist in Mine Village because of Rust Remover and Acidic Solution.{nl}He was being so arrogant...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007039	Well done. {nl}This place is almost completed so go help Alruida near Apsuba Hall.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007040	Ah, I forgot to tell you. {nl}He is my colleague. He is probably looking for the gold plate at the great hall.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007041	Alruida
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007042	You came here since Yustas told you to help?{nl}I was tired as hell so I really welcome you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007043	First, we should look for the gold plate at the great hall.{nl}Shall we start?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007044	Someone should research at the camp and the other person should look for the gold plate.{nl}That's why I am here. I am not a coward like Yustas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007045	Now, I know all the locations of the gold plates, but I can't do anything about the monsters.{nl}It is so fortunate that you would help me. really.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007046	This reaction reagent only reacts to the gold plates from the specific era.{nl}The gold plate that shows boiling response is the one that we are looking for. You understand right?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007047	We gotta distinguish the real ones by finding out when the gold plate was created.{nl}We should look for the gold plate that was built before the establishment of the kingdom.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007048	The next one is at Apsuba Hall.{nl}The gold plate is under the bushes in the corner, but I can't do anything about it myself.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007049	Originally, it was forgotten and was deep in the ground.{nl}But, the day of the divine tree was in fact beneficial.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007050	As the land caved over, they were carried away to the various places in Istora Ruins...{nl}That's our prediction.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007051	Be careful all the time. The monsters here rush in scarelessly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007052	It is a disaster to someone and it is a blessing for the other.{nl}I can remember the words from the old literature.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007053	Oh! That's it. Give it to me. Let's see... I should first make it corrode.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007054	The gold plate that you found for me a while ago... I think the next part is remaining.{nl}The gold plate that I know is that one so I don't know what to do from now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007055	Ah, there is one place that I haven't searched yet. Polsas Highway.{nl}Could you go there for me?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007056	Bring this detector.{nl}From the place where you can feel the reaction, the gold plate must be there.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007057	That's it! Now we found all the records.{nl}You've done it well. Now, I should sprinkle this rust remover so give it to me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007058	As I expected, this gold plate was the last one.{nl}Now we've collected all gold plates... I think I know what's written on them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007059	Can you give this to Yustas?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007060	So Alruida did it and the gold plate that we didn't know...{nl}Okay. We solved all the puzzles. Please wait a bit.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007061	Yustas must be waiting.{nl}Please give it to him.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007062	I never thought that the gold plate would explode. I am sorry.{nl}I will gather the contents all at once later and show you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007063	These are the contents that I never thought about.{nl}The goddesses and the humans once used to live together. And the demons?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007064	If Demetrius is sane, this record... okay.{nl}I promised you that I will show you the record so read the copy yourself.{nl}Well done indeed!
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007065	They were gentle monsters but suddenly became vicious. {nl}Have you also heard anything like this?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007066	Revelator, we are in trouble. Please help us!{nl}As you can see, the workers are dying due to the poison of the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007067	It's so fortunate that you are here.{nl}How come I can't hear anything from the soldiers who went to defeat Gorgon.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007068	Mirtis is dead, but the Vubbes are still following its order.{nl}And there's also a rumor that stronger Vubbes were spotted at the 2nd lot.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007069	The village will be in mess if those Vubbes come out from the mine.{nl}Could you check the 2nd lot in Crystal Mine if you are okay?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007070	You can go down to 2nd lot from the isolated district in the 3rd floor in Crystal Mine.{nl}Okay, then I am counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007071	They are more dangerous Vubbes.{nl}We can't guarantee the safety of Klaipeda.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007072	The Vubbes climbed upto the 1st lot? {nl}It's worse than I expected.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007073	This is the scent I mixed exclusively for Vubbes. {nl}This will cause lethargy and fear.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007074	It is a problem that it is still in the test stage, but you can't do anything about it at the moment.{nl}I will put it into the incense burner so please place it at 2nd lot in Crystal Mine.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007075	I am researching with respect to various aspects so that it would never occur again.{nl}I can't think of a better way besides the scent at the moment.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007076	Well done indeed.{nl}This is for testing so I don't know how long it would last, but I guess it would be safe for a while.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007077	I am dizzy since the Pantos are keep trying to get out from Gelli Plateau.{nl}If they go into the region where people live, that will be a big problem.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007078	So I am thinking about sprinkling the scent of Moas onto the way to Gelli Plateau.{nl}Moas are the biggest enemies of Pantos. I will think about a way to prevent it from going out somehow.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007083	They are the things that can't be done by me...
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007084	Really? First, I need Fishermen's eyes and the essences of Ellums. {nl}I heard they live at the entrance of Katyn Forest.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007085	I never went upto the entrance of Katyn Forest so I am scared.{nl}I heard that is the road where spirits lost their ways.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007086	Damn. Disgusting.{nl}I will make the strings which Pantos will be scared.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007087	Okay. I made the strings.{nl}Now, could you put them on the Srautas Gorge and Nepritas Cliffs?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007088	To tell you exactly.{nl}Hm... I will just mark it on the map.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150714_007089	Thanks for helping me.{nl}This must be effective so you can feel you did something worthwhile.
