QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008393	{memo X}{nl}Can you help me out for a while? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008394	{memo X}I belong to the Anastos. {nl}The Nestos still pursue unconditional belief even at this point when the Goddesses are all gone. {nl}That's why they are building sanctuaries here and there. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008395	{nl}What's the use of sanctuaries when the Goddesses are all gone? {nl}When you know it will just be corrupted like this even if you build it. {nl}On the other hand, the Anastos pursue practicality. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008396	{memo X}{nl}People come first, mopping up the demons come first, and what's the use of faith when the Goddess themselves abandoned us?  
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008397	{memo X}There is another sanctuary over there. {nl}I will finish burning this sanctuary so please destroy the one over there. {nl}We need to teach those Nestos as lesson. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008398	{memo X}{nl}I'm sure the sanctuary over there is also fuming red enegy. {nl}A sign of corruption.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008401	{memo X}This is the sacred sanctuary of the Nestos. Did you do this? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008402	{memo X}I have never heard about someone like that. {nl}I may not know every singe person in Anastopas but I at least know those who set up this camp.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008403	{memo X}I'm at loss for any word.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008404	{memo X}{nl}Albinas? He is one of Anastopas? That can't be. {nl}Bring that person here. I need to check for myself. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008405	{memo X}Are you saying that Albinas guy is missing? {nl}It's getting out of hand. {nl}I'm sure Anastos won't do such a thing. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008406	{memo X}{nl}Anyway, our priority then is to restore this sanctuary. {nl}You did this so you should be responsible for it. {nl}There are rocks over there. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008407	{memo X}{nl}This sanctuary was also made of the rocks here so collect some rocks. {nl}And the Nestos Camp is over there. {nl}You'll find someone named Eduinas . {nl}Ask him to polish the rocks to use as materials for restoring the sanctuary. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008408	{memo X}If he finds out you did this to the sanctuary, he won't polish the rocks easily. {nl}But that's a price you have to pay and you should be responsbile for it. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008409	{memo X}Still not done yet?

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008412	{memo X}What? Destoryed the sanctuary? {nl}The sanctuary that was built with everyone's efforts here? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008413	{memo X}I don't need your apologies. {nl}I'll polish the rocks to use as materials since Damijonas said so but don't ever do that again. {nl}And while I polish these, I don't want to see your face so go away and take care of some monsters nearby.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008414	{memo X}You should wait longer. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008415	{memo X}Done. Now, don't ever do that again.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008417	{memo X}Done. It's a good thing it wasn't totally destroyed. {nl}I apologize for being angry at you a while ago. Seeing the sanctuary destroyed was upsetting. {nl}But it's not total nonsense. {nl}Anastos and Nestos may be in conflict of interests but we do not invade each other's territory. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008418	{memo X}{nl}But you mentioned someone from Anastos that I don't even know as the reason behind destroying the sanctuary so I couldn't hold my anger. {nl}Anyway, at least you restored it...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008419	{memo X}{nl}But it strange. I have never heard of that name...{nl}Anastos Camp is in the northern side so why don't you go there and ask. {nl}It really is strange.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008428	{memo X}{nl}Uh...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008429	{memo X}{nl}Nope. I can't think of anyone on Anastos with that name. {nl}Moreover, he hold you go burn and destroy the Nestos sanctuary? {nl}Oh my god...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008430	{memo X}{nl}Nonsense. We don't do such a thing. {nl}I think we need to investigate on that matter. {nl}We give danger signal fires when we send out people for investigation {nl}and we ran out of it just now. {nl}Can you find some firepowder that are used to make the danger signal fires? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008431	We all servce the Goddess. That is why we're on the pilgrimages. {nl}It's just a small difference in how we see the world. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008432	{nl}Nestos people say that we should believe in the Goddesses unconditionally even if they disappeared, {nl}while we, the Anastos, pursue something more practical. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008433	{nl}Defeating demons, improving the qualities of human lives... we have to aim for those things.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008434	{memo X}Monsters are all around so it will be difficult to obtain the materials.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008435	{memo X}But, Albinas... We don't feel good about it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008436	Okay, good. That's enough.{nl}Now, we will make flame bombs. Please wait a bit.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008437	We've completed the flame bomb... Now I will call my colleague.{nl}He is called Fabius.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008438	{memo X}Fabius is a moderatist among Anastos, so he won't have problem even if he meets one of Nestos on his way.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008439	{memo X}Since Fabius left... we would somehow get some answer.{nl}But, I don't feel good about it. Is there any information...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008440	{memo X}{nl}Ah! Barte over ther must know something.{nl}He arrived here while travelling various locations.{nl}How about we ask about Albinas there?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008441	It's just a different perspective of looking at the world. {nl}The topic they cover the most...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008442	{nl}The disappearances of the Goddesses were done spontaneously so are we going to still follow then after they abondoned us...{nl}Another problem is whether we, humans should continue to manage the world where the Goddesses have disappeared...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008443	{nl}Are we going to aim for the truth or trust the Goddessses and pray... that will be the difference.{nl}But, they are just conflicting each other and they don't deny each others' existences.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008444	{memo X}She is rather progressive.{nl}So since she is not close to me... I want you to go to her.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008445	Barte
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008446	{memo X}{nl}Ah, yes. I am called Barte.{nl}I was on a journey until recently. I am thinking about leaving againn.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008447	{memo X}Albinas... Is that him?{nl}When we arrived at the camp recently, one man was wearing the same outfit like us so I was going to say hello, but then I felt something was not right so I decided not to.{nl}He was giggling as he was looking at the leathers that were engraved with writings and he ripped off those leathers.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008448	{memo X}{nl}I was scared since that wasn't the power of a human, but he threw all those leathers on the ground and disappeared down there. The monsters thought that was the time and ate all the leathers. Was the smell of blood on those leathers?...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008449	{memo X}{nl}It was scary. {nl}Ah, I think the monsters there could've not digested the leathers as yet... {nl}Can you bring them? I am curious too.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008450	The people who are progressive are a minority among Anastos.{nl}They are asserting to stop conflicting with Nestos, but instead try to change Nestos.{nl}So that Albinas probably told them he is also progressive.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008451	{nl}So he could make you participate into destroying the sanctums of Nestos.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008452	{memo X}I can connect the burnt leathers together.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008453	{memo X}The monsters have those.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008454	{memo X}Let's see...

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008458	{memo X}We don't have time. Hurry.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008461	{memo X}The flame bomb has exploded!{nl}Please hurry to Fabius!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008462	{memo X}{nl}And one more thing I should tell you...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008463	{memo X}{nl}To defeat the demons, Nestos may be better, when you stop by their camp and explain about the circumstances, they would tell you how to defeat Albinas.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008464	{memo X}Damn...{nl}That was his plot.{nl}I thought it was suspicious.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008465	{memo X}{nl}Please take this divine object.{nl}You would be able to defeat the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008466	{memo X}You are safe.{nl}I've heard from Fabius.{nl}Everything was Vaiga's plot...{nl}We should be cautious all the time.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008467	It's bad enough that they were killed by the Vubbes, but even their keepsakes are being abused. How awful...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008468	Thank you. {nl} My comrades will now be able to rest in peace.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008469	It hurts to think about giving these keepsakes to my dead comrades' families.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008470	Thank you very much. {nl} My comrades can now rest in peace with the Goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008471	{memo X}Damn. {nl}It's too wide so let's move seperately.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008472	{memo X}First, you go deep into that place.{nl}Who knows? The demons with the special power may possess something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008473	{memo X}I am so mad.{nl}There isn't anything special and the demons didn't have anything.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008474	Did we search an empty area?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008475	I will search the area up here.{nl}Let's meet later.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008476	How about you?{nl}Have you obtained anything?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008477	{memo X}Wait!{nl}I can sense something big from Monocle.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008479	{memo X}Monocle is looking for the hidden object that is hidden inside the special power. It is a big object.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008480	{memo X}Go there and chek.{nl}Like a while ago, the demons may appear and there may be really strong demons there... I will hide myself here.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008485	{memo X}I know the special power which Ruklys hid here exists.{nl}If it is your task to find it, then I will help for sure.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008486	You can't say no nor ask for reasons to the kingdom orders.{nl}But as I lived here for my life, I have many things to think.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008487	The kingdom order told us to ban anyone's entrance here, but I think the Goddess made us to meet each other here.{nl}The Goddess is not under the kingdom.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008488	{memo X}If it is about the Goddess, then I will do the guide.{nl}At least, there aren't anything here so let's go to the next area.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008489	{memo X}Ah, I totally forgot.{nl}I've prepared many things to block the intruders, but I totally forgot about them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008490	I need a cerificate.{nl}It was created to attack the ones who are not permitted ferociously.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008491	{memo X}To make a certificate, we first need a mushroom.{nl}There are many mushrooms at the lower area so please get me one.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008493	They are enough to make the certificate.{nl}Please wait a bit.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008494	{memo X}What I can do for you is to put my sign on the certificate.{nl}But, I am too old to use magic.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008496	{memo X}I am not like the old days.{nl}When I made that certificate, I thought I would never make anymore.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008497	{memo X}I never knew that I would be making this again... Please wait.{nl}I will make it quickly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008498	{memo X}Let's go more deep inside. {nl}I hope you can find the one that you are looking for. {nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008504	But, those spirits are dangerous.{nl}Since they only have the thoughts of that time. Their hatred towards the kingdom soldiers.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008505	{memo X}The Soul Stones that read the memories of the spirits are beside me.{nl}I've created them. I've tried to read their memories in the past many times.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008506	But, what we received in return were only hatred.{nl}For them, we are just kingdom soldiers that are trying to occupy the Fortress of the Great Earth.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008507	{memo X}It is unfortunate, but to make them not to go crazy, you would need the token of the restraint.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008508	It is very complex to make the token of the restraint.{nl}We've failed that time, but since we have you this time, it will be much easier this time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008509	I will tell you in steps, so please first bring the eggs of Rajatad.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008510	{memo X}The spirits only have the feeling of anger left.{nl}I guess we can't do anything about it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008511	{memo X}This egg is the power to restrain.{nl}Now, we need something to execute the power.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008512	{memo X}To execute the power, the bones of the demons are the best.{nl}When you get the bones, I will move the power of restraint that is in the eggs to the bones of the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008513	Even I failed to pull out the memories of the spirits.{nl}I feel reliable since you are with me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008514	{memo X}Well done.{nl}We only have to do the last step in order to complete the token of the restraint.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008515	As I told you before, I've tried to look at the memories of the spirits.{nl}The resistances from the spirits were too aggressive at then, so I failed that time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008516	But, now I have you and the token of the restraint.{nl}If we could bring the spirtis, we may able to read the memories with the soul stones that are beside me.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008517	Please bring the spirits here with the token of the restraint.{nl}I will get prepared.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008518	Please bring the spirits fast.{nl}I am also curious.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008519	{memo X}They are breaking something after receiving an order from Ruklys.{nl}I think that may be related to the revelation of the Goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008520	{memo X}I should find out about the device which Ruklys destroyed.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008521	{memo X}We can look at the detailed memories of the spirits by enhancing the token of the restraint.{nl}Due to enhanced token of the restraint, the spirits would resist. If the spirits resist, suppress them with your power and use the token of the spirit.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008522	I have no choice even if the spirits suffer. {nl}That's the best way I can help you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008523	Finally found it.{nl}I've been looking for it for 600 years and finally... found the revelation.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008524	{memo X}Please put the vitality of the monsters into this bone.{nl}Then, the power to restrain, the power to release, and the power to execute, all steps will be put into those.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008525	That's an old method.{nl}If we complete this, you may able to see the memories of the spirits that were with Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008526	{memo X}Even we if we know the method, it is useless if we can't execute it.{nl}I wasn't able to obtain the vitalities of the monsters...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008527	Good. {nl}That's the token of the restraint.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008528	Don't care that much even if we use the demons.{nl}What's important is that we should look for the revelation of the Goddess.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008529	Are there spirits that are wandering around the Fortress of the Great Earth without going to the Goddesses?{nl}I can't see them suffering anymore.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008530	I can only help you to make the owl sculptures.{nl}Those owls would guide the spirits that lost their ways.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008531	Can you put the sculptures of the owls at the Fortress of the Great Earth?{nl}If you guide the spirits to the owl sculptures, then you would be able to go beside the Goddesses.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008591	There was a story behind that. But, what Erikas said is right.{nl}I was chasing after the hunter of Kartas with my subordinates.{nl}But, it was too much for us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008592	So I've told Erikas who used to live near there to lend us her power to defeat the hunter of Kartas.{nl}Erikas asked for some collateral in return for lending us the blessed crystal.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008596	I can unleash the hunter of Kartas from the seal alone, but{nl}In order to maintain the power of the crystal, we would need help from the subordinates.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008599	Eventually, everyone dedicated their lives to seal the hunter of Kartas.{nl}But, since me and my subordinates don't have bodies, we won't get disturbed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008600	I can feel some sacred power within you.{nl}If you could eliminate that demon, we will help.{nl}Please complete the task that we couldn't complete...

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008604	Eventually, that girl ran away. {nl}I don't know why, but deep inside my heart, there was some voice echoing to protect her.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008605	Since we were able to tie up the hunter of Kartas here, she was able to run away safely.{nl}Although, it turned out like this, I don't have any regrets.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008606	It's not that I did that for good faith.{nl}But, I feel sorry for my family... that they couldn't see Justina.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008607	The scent of the spirits have the power to pull out the memories of the dead.{nl}I will put the power of the scroll of the dead here.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008612	I am happy to meet my subordinates again because of you,.{nl}Look at their spirits with great determination. They will fulfill our mission even after their deaths.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008613	Let's pull out the hunter of Kartas from now on.{nl}But, the power of the blessed crystal is too strong so there's no way that I could unleash that demon...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008614	Then, I have no choice, but to use some dirty method.{nl}To weaken the strong sacred power, we need some evil energy.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008615	Defeat the monsters and bring some Wrongful Teeth.{nl}With that, if we weaken the power of the crystal, that demon would try to come out without knowing that it's a trap.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008616	And that will be our last chance to eliminate it.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008617	Thanks for helping me this far.{nl}Now, listen to the last wish of the dead...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008618	I can feel some evil energy.{nl}Since I don't want you get dirty, let's finish this quickly.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008621	Thanks. Please pass this crystal to my daughter's friend.{nl}Now, I will return to the Goddesses with my subordinates.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008624	Now, I will return this to Erikas.{nl}I really appreciate for your help on behalf of my friend, Justina Legwyn.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008625	I can tell this to you freely.{nl}The keepsakes of Lydia Schaffen... I came out from the Star Tower with my colleagues to protect them.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008630	I think we should move.{nl}Can you lure the chasers so that I could go to Guoda Empty Lot?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008631	When we fire this disposable signal bomb, they will follow you.{nl}I am counting on you...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008632	As you lure them, I will move secretly.{nl}Let's meet at Guoda Empty Lot.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008636	Then my colleagues would know that I am here...{nl}Maybe, we could also lure the demons.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008637	To do so, we need to something to make smoke...{nl}But, I've used everything I've had.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008638	Good. I saw Red Leaves as I ran away. To Ruda trail. {nl}Can you collect those?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008639	Many people left the Star Tower as the tyranny of the leader Ignas continued.{nl}I tried my best to endure, but...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008640	I could not endure when he was trying to eliminate the keepsakes of Lydia Schaffen.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008641	How come I haven't thought about this. {nl}I should have set the traps already...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008642	Lastly... can you put this trap on Ruda Trail across here?{nl}I will hide here until I get recovered.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008643	{memo X}My colleagues who were on the same side with me would also be chased by now.{nl}We were to meet at Orsha, but I don't know how far they've come...

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008651	Ah... You've already met Irmantas and Grazina.{nl}That's good. I have to meet Irmantas right away since I have the words to pass him!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008652	I've seen it for sure.{nl}The demons were among the chasers of Ignas.{nl}They seemed to be close to each other.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008653	I am sure Ignas has colluded with the demons.{nl}I think eliminating the keepsakes of Lydia Schaffen is a part of that collusion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008654	But, I was badly hurt as wel...{nl}I am not sure if I can meet Irmantas again in my life.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008659	Please take me to Irmantas.{nl}We have to tell the ones who are following the determination of Lydia Schaffen that they are colluded with the demons!

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008661	No... I feel like I am going to lose my conciousness if I walk little more.{nl}I feel like I am hearing the voices... of the Goddess.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008715	You're here? {nl}What did Eminent say? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008716	{memo X}Good thing he doesn't seem to find anything suspicious. {nl}We must not give any parts to Eminent until the magic circle of Ruklys is activated.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008719	{memo X}It will work when you write on it again. {nl}I'll take care of the magic circle below so I'll leave this to you.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008724	I feel lucky to have met you among the many Revelators. {nl}You saved the world, right?

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008726	Uh... Is that an army note? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008727	Right. Those belong to my colleagues. {nl}I don't know when it would be, but I want to send their keepsakes back to their hometown someday. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008728	Speaking of which, could you give me that army note?
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008729	Hopefully, I will be able to return to hometown together with the keepsakes of my colleagues. {nl}And my colleagues would surely want that too. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008730	I will surely bring it back to hometown. {nl}My fellows will want that too. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008731	Come to think of it, there was a Goddess's divine object in Sielva Prayer Room. {nl}I think offering a prayer to that divine object will give us some answers. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008732	The dead ones that wake up again are the problems. {nl}Why don't we purify them and keep them from waking up. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008733	We break their coffin before they wake up. {nl}Even for the dead ones, it will be better than forcibly waking up. {nl}What do you think? Will you help? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008734	You must be careful not to open the coffin lid when you break the coffin. {nl}When the coffin opens, the dead will jump out and attack.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008735	Good work. {nl}I'm sure they will also thank you for making them rest in peace. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008736	The problem is that divine object. {nl}I can't approach anywhere near it because of the barrier. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008737	Maybe the gravekeeper would know something about the divine object and the barrier...{nl}But the gravekeeper doesn't like me. We had a thing in the past. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008738	I met the gravekeeper while working on purifying in the name of the Goddess. {nl}I was actually helping the gravekeeper but he was really mad about it. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008739	The gravekeeper stands at the end of Vevapi Aisle. {nl}Can you ask him about the divine object of the Goddess for me? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008740	A divine object of the Goddess? {nl}What. Are you in a team with that rude Bokor? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008741	Get out of this grave site. {nl}Just thinking about that Bokor brings back my anger. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008742	That Bokor went around breaking the coffins of the dead saying they rise back! {nl}I don't understand how he can do such a thing with a sane mind!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008743	Divine object that you can't even approach... {nl}I understand if they block the monsters or demons from getting close to it but even humans, that I don't understand.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008744	The people from Tree Order or something were here first before that Bokor Juta guy. {nl}They claimed that they were officially acknowledged by Goddess Zemyna or something? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008745	They said they'd carry out the will of the Goddess Zemyna since this land was blessed by her. {nl}How could I have stopped that. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008746	But since their arrival, the dead started to rise again. {nl}If that was on purpose, there couldn't have been an insult worse than that! {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008747	That was giving me a headache already then some Bokor comes along breaking the coffins. {nl}Breaking the coffins to purify the dead does not show any respect for the dead!
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008748	That is not important. {nl}I want to calm all this fuss as soon as possible. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008749	If you help me, then I will believe you that the Bokor didn't come here with bad intentions. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008750	Burying it back on the ground is not all. {nl}Pay respect to the dead using this match and cremate their bodies. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008751	What are you waiting for! Move quickly! {nl}I cannot.. handle it anymore. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008752	Sorry for being sharp a while ago. I was a bit sensitive. {nl}Actually, having to point the blades to people whom I should take care of as a gravekeeper is not something I am comfortable with. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008753	Thank you for giving them peace for me. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008754	Anyway, I know of the divine object of the Goddess that the Bokor mentioned.{nl}Those guys from Tree of Truth order made it one day. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008755	Maybe that is why the dead rose... {nl}I had my suspicions but I couldn't approach it either. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008756	Ah! That's right. {nl}Since long time ago, some Bokor or Necromancer not in their sane minds used to come here secretly. {nl}They used to do insane experiments on the dead who are rested in here. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008757	So my father learned how to make shaman dolls from the guards nearby Klaipeda. {nl}He said if you put spells on the shaman dolls, it finds the power that messes with the grave and destroys it or something? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008758	There is a box in Kansias Stone Chamber with my father's belongings. {nl}There should be a shaman doll in it. {nl}I don't think I can.. make it through the bodies. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008759	Our family has been gravekeepers for generations. {nl}My father passed away during the disaster on Medzio Diena so I took his place since then. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008760	I only learned over hid shoulders... {nl}But I am the gravekeeper of this place now. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008761	Right! This is it.{nl}It wasn't used for a long time, but it should work well since father made it. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008762	Done. Now go to the divine object. {nl}If that divine object is the reason behind the dead rising here, the shaman doll will break the barrier and destroy the divine object. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008763	It's the shaman doll that father used. {nl}If we do as my father used to do, then nothing will go wrong. Just as my father used to do...
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008764	If the shaman doll attacked the divine object, then it means it detected an eveil enery. {nl}But the shaman doll was the one destroyed... {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008765	Anyway, if the barrier broke, then your friend Bokor must be able to identify it. {nl}What about going back to that Bokor and asking him? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008766	Huh? You really broke the barrier? {nl}See, I knew the gravekeeper would help. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008767	Actually, I was a but suspicious myself. {nl}I felt a bad energy from the barrier considering that it was something that covered the divine object of the Goddess. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008768	Anyway, since the barrier is now broken, let's go together. {nl}If it really is a divine object of the Goddess, then it will react to the prayer for the Goddess. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008769	Will you go ahead first? {nl}I will follow as soon as I'm ready for the prayer. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008770	A Shaman doll.. Evil energy... It really is suspicious.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008771	Thank you for saving me. I almost went to the Goddess. {nl}I guess it is a lie that it was a divine object of the Goddess. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008772	The object of the Goddess would not summon such a monster. {nl}I smell something fishy with that Tree of Truth order. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008773	Since the object here was not real, now we must find the trace of Goddess Zemyna from somewhere else. {nl}It's ok. If something like this makes me frustrated, then I would not have kept my journey until here. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008774	But before I leave, I must help the gravekeeper and keep the fuss down. {nl}Now that the evil object is gone, my abilities will help keep this place calm. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008775	I want to show my sincerity to the gravekeeper, but the image of him being angry at me holds me back. {nl}If you're on the way to the gravekeeper, can you send him my sincerity as well? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008776	{memo X}No wonder. That object wasn't that of the Goddess. {nl}Using the name of the Goddess into tricks like this. They have crossed the line. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008777	I want to go and make them pay for it right away. {nl}But as a gravekeeper, keeping this place secure comes first. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008778	Was that Bokor's name Juta? {nl}His ability powers will be of much help. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008779	The Tree of Truth order went in to the Kalail Mausoluem. {nl}They said they will find something to carry out their order or something...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008780	If ever you go to Kalail Mausoleum, be careful about them. {nl}No matter how much I think about it, they are not in their right minds. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008781	If this is not it either, I can't help but be exhausted. {nl}Where do you think Goddess Zemyna has gone? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008782	Oh my god, the Divine Tree! {nl}The Divine Tree answered my prayers and sent someone to save me!{nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008787	I am collecting the spirit of the dead that rose back, as the order told me to. {nl}Margiris can read the memories of the dead when they were alive from the spirit stones.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008796	Margiris told us salvation is not something we can get so easily. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008797	This work purifies the sins of the foolish as well as ours. {nl}Those who die during the process is because their belief is not enough. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008798	Only those who stand it will earn salvation. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008799	Poor Gintas... {nl}You've stood the despair of death alone.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008801	I used to focus on purifying the sins of the dead like Gintas. {nl}I thought I would earn salvation. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008802	But one day, I saw the record books of Margiris. {nl}As far as I knew, those book keep a record of the process of purifying the sins of the dead. {nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008810	But don't worry. {nl}The souls that are forgiven will soon be with the Divine Tree. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008811	Thank you for helping until here. {nl}Here, let me give you a seal of Truth. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008812	Margiris is along the way to Kalail's grave. {nl}If you bring this to him, he will acknowledge your contributions. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008813	Don't tell Gintas about the story of Kalail. {nl}He won't believe it. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008814	I want to save you buy I don't know how... 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008815	Who are you? {nl}Ah, it's the Gintas's Seal of Truth. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008816	There are too many people who want to join the order for salvation. {nl}Anyway, welcome. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008817	I think my ankle is getting better so a little more rest will do. {nl}Please be careful and may we meet again. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008818	Sorry to ask you when you've just joined the order, but there is something we need you to do. {nl}We are cleansing the sins of those who have died here. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008819	I woke the soul of Kalail. {nl}He used to take some land of the Kingdom when he was alive. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008820	He was not able to let go of that even after this death. {nl}He did a document of sins somewhere in this gravesite. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008821	To save his soul, we must find the hidden document and make him let go of the his regrets from the time he was alive. {nl}But there seems to be greed left in him and he won't speak up about the whereabout of the document. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008822	Can you try to persuade Kalail? {nl}Since he doesn't know your face, try to act as if you're not part of the order. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008823	If you find out the whereabouts of the documents, I will bless you with the grace of Divine Tree. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008824	You just won't give up, do you. {nl}I don't know who you are or what you want. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008825	What are you asking from me and bugging me when you don't even tell me what it is for.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008826	I will understand if you play rough with him in case he doesn't listen to you. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008827	What are you? {nl}Why are you disturbing other people's gravesites? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008828	I have lived my life honestly.{nl}And you think I have hidden some document with the record of my sins?{nl}Stop speaking nonsense and go away! 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008829	If you are really on the Goddess' side, then you have no reason to stand seeing something that disgrace her name. {nl}What are you waiting for? {nl} 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008830	Such awful peopel. {nl}Setting that up as a sacred object... {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008831	I think that seal has weakend the energy of that thing. {nl}It must have thought that we're on the same side. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008832	Anyway, since you've taken care of that horrible thing, I will believe what you say. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008833	No wonder it was suspicious. That leader wasn't human! {nl}Right, that thing wasn't human... {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008834	Why are they making such a fuss in this grave. What are they after? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008835	After hearing your story, it seems that they are after the ownership of the villa in Kaliss Province. {nl}There is a copy of the list of villa owners that I used to handle when I was alive. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008836	They must have wanted to get their hands on that copy and use it to make false testimony claiming that the lands in Kaliss belong to them. {nl}Fortunately, it seems like they were not able to find it. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008837	I suspected something like this to happen and hid the list in Seima Stone Chamber. {nl}Can you gather the scattered list of villa owners? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008838	The villa ownership is supposed to be managed by the next generation of deputies... {nl}But he was not someone to be trusted so I requested that the manuscript of records be buried with me when I die in my will. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008839	He may look like a good guy but he even as a public official, he had private meetings with unknown people... {nl}And I caught him forging records at one point.  
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008840	It bring chills thinking that they could have found the records. {nl}If they are preying on each province records like this, then only Kaliss but the whole kingdom will fall under the hands of the demons soon. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008841	Good thing you're her. {nl}That is the record of land owners in Kaliss province. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008842	Now we have to engrave the shaman doll with the energy that messes the grave. {nl}I saw the site where they cremated the dead a shile ago and there was a black crystal that I've never seen before. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008843	I'm sure the black crystals are the traces of evil magic that woke up the dead. {nl}Can you get more of it from the dead that rose? 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008844	Ah, I will take care of the fallen dead bodies. {nl}For now there is something more important to do. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008845	Yeah, this will be enough. {nl}I will prepare the shaman doll right away. Hold on. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008846	What? You are not a follower of that order? {nl}Are you telling me to believe you? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008847	Alright. {nl}Then destroy that divine object that they claim to have received the blessings of the Goddess. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008848	I have never seen a blessed diving object fume evil energy. {nl}I think that object is messing this gravesite. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008849	I brought the Kaliss land owners list to my grave to stop the corruption of the next generation. {nl}But to think of it, this record has now become useless. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008850	Since they will siege for this document again. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008851	I will give this record to you. {nl}If you make sure destroy it, I will be able to lay in peace again. {nl}Please.
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008852	It doesn't make sense no matter how much I think of it. {nl}How did they find this place. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008853	Villa ownership is actually a very sensitive matter so the records are not really known to public. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008854	Only the current deputy knows that I have handled the records. {nl}How did they know about this place... 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008855	But it is strange. {nl}To have a barrier blocking people from approaching the divine object.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008856	Even if it is sacred, if that is how it is, no one can approach it. {nl}I mean, it's as if it doesn't want anybody to come near it. 
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008857	Place this Soul Stone then defeat the dead nearby.{nl}The souls of the dead will be absorbedinto this stone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008858	This cleanses the sins of the dead and yours too. {nl}Also, Margiris will be very happy about it. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008859	Good luck then.

QUEST_LV_0100_20151001_008863	But among the rest of the revelators only you... {nl}Only you can save the world with me. {nl}
