QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000802	The power of the altar makes conversion simple. {nl} First, you activate the power of Globejas' altar. {nl} Then, stay within the influence of the altar to fight the demons.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000803	The demons have stronger minds than you might think. {nl}It will take a lot of effort to make them forget about Gesti.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000866	I studied the barrier of the gate, but the power of the altar in the basement is not enough. {nl} Unless you add the power of the crystal held by Corylus.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000867	Maybe the Goddess knew it'd fail and that's why she said wait for the Revelator. {nl} At least, we got the Gesti hurt so it can also be good.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000875	You are indeed the revelator.{nl}Now, we can concentrate on protecting the altar.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000876	Don't worry, the barrier of the main entrance on the 1st floor can be offset by the power of the chapel. {nl}That's what the altars are for. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000877	Let's take care of the Unknocker first. {nl} I'll lead the Unknocker, you'll have to try to find a chance.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000889	Strange, it was definitely working.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000890	It was an ambush. {nl} We would have been in big trouble without your help.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000891	You need the crest of space to enter the hidden sanctuary. {nl} It's hidden in the Sventove Central Altar, but I just hope it's not too late.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000892	Structures in the Tenet Chapel are placed to ward against the demons. {nl} Each one in itself is a small barrier that contributes to a huge barrier. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000893	The most powerful barrier is on the 2nd floor. {nl} I heard that it can exert the greatest force when the Divine Sphere is there.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000894	Gesti made the first move. {nl} It will be difficult to approach secretly.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000895	I must change the plan. {nl} First, you need to go watch Gesti's actions. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000896	Let's start by occupying the Bell Tower.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000897	From here, we can see what Gesti is going to do.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000898	Alright, bring the crest of space from the Sventove Central Altar. {nl} You can do it, right?
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000899	You must know that the revelation is hidden in the sanctuary. {nl} The crest of space is the only key that will get you to the sanctuary. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000900	It's not just the Tenet Chapel. {nl} You can enter all the places that the Goddess hid.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000901	The crest of space can only be used by the Revelator, so you won't be able to find the revelation right away. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000902	But the enemy is the Demon Queen. Even the Paladin Master couldn't defeat her.{nl}I should use the power of the Broken Altar.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000903	We can't do anything about the destroyed altar, but the fragments still have power. {nl} Gather the pieces and insert them in the 8 pillars of the Sventove Central Hall.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000904	When you are done, I will be able to restrict Gesti through the power of the Divine Sphere and the chapel. {nl} It may be for a short while but that's the best option we have.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000905	So you activated the Malda altar? {nl} Now it will be safe to stay here for the time being. Good work.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000906	Demons are going around the second floor searching every corner. {nl} Activating the Auka altar will catch their attention.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000908	Good job. {nl} When this is over, I should gather all brothers and drive them away at once.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000909	I'll ring the bell and let you know when Gesti shows up, so have a safe trip on your way.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000910	{memo X}So you found the crest of space. {nl}Use the crest on the pillar beside me to go to the sanctuary. {nl} It is prepared for the Revelator only.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000911	May the blessings of the Goddess be with you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000912	So Gesti just ran away. {nl} Fine. Since you got the revelation, we've completed the mission. {nl}

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000914	{memo X}When you find the revelation, tell the Paladin Master of the story you've been through so far. {nl} May the blessings of the Goddess be with you.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000915	Seems like Gesti did not notice yet. {nl}We better prepare the Divine Sphere.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000916	All the preparations have been made. {nl} The barriers of the chapel will soon weaken Gesti. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000917	Once weakend, Gesti will be enough for you to handle. {nl} When Gesti is cornered, I will make the final strike with the Divine Sphere.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000918	This is a piece of Mazas shelter barrier. {nl} Do not worry. {nl} There are ways to recover the barrier so I'm sure it will be alright.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000919	I didn't know the demons were using a summoner to come across here. {nl} Better defeat them all before they siege us.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000920	Even with so many demons, you still managed to make it through. {nl} You may be the Revelator, but that's still impressive. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000921	It's the revelation. {nl} Cherish it and do not show it to anyone else. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000922	Come on. Go to the Paladin Master. {nl} He will tell you the way you must go.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000923	I asked my precious friend Algis to go to Tenet Chapel. {nl} I won't lose to Gesti but it is important to have some back up plan just in case.

QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000935	All souls are pure. {nl} So even if it's a demon's soul, it can still provide some divine power.
QUEST_LV_0100_20150317_000936	Oh, the tree guard post was filled with a demon's soul. {nl} It still needs some final touches for completion, but I'll take care of it. {nl}Great job.
