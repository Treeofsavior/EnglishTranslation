QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000116	It is still in progress to find the reality of the events.{nl}Take it. It's a soul collection scroll.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000123	If you go back the way you just came, there will be an obervatory tower on the hills.{nl}I hope monsters don't touch it yet..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000124	Are they really planning something?{nl}Something.. is suspicious..

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000127	Good. Are you ready?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000128	Before you came, I saw Bubbes moving in groups.{nl}Go to Gebene Cliffs and see how the situation is.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000129	At the end of everything that happened here, Bubbes were always involved.{nl}It is not a coincendence..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000130	I think.. I understand now. {nl}I think that was like a big factory creating huge monsters called Woodspirits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000131	The flag of Bubbes may have called the ghosts.{nl}The ghosts that were gathered polluted the trees and created huge monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000132	That tree barks must have been the ingredients for making Woodspirits.{nl}These must have not been done by thos Bubbes.{nl}They must have received an order from somebody!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000133	We may find something decisive at the place where Bubbes are grouped together.{nl}If Prey sees this, it will like it!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000134	Bubbes are not smart enough so he must have made only simple orders.{nl}How could he thought about controlling those bubbes..{nl}I don't know what to say. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000135	I am sure that Woodspirits are created from various places.{nl}I can sense vicious energies coming. {nl}We should first destroy the flag that is creating Woodspirits!
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000136	Leave as soon as you are ready. {nl}The best action for now is to stop creating Woodspirits..
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000137	I think we've done our best for now. {nl}Since we can't do anything about the ones that were already created.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_000138	I can feel that the flag that is closest here is near Gatves Highway.{nl}The huge trees that the people saw is probably Woodspirits.{nl}How could I miss this simple thing.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001030	Anyone would know that its because of the honey, but I don't know what the disciples are doing.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001031	I made a request at Klaipeda, but they are not responding since they have a lack of soldiers.{nl}And it is not easy to hire merceneries in this era.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001034	Oh, this is quite big.{nl}Well done.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001035	You go back to Bulbini Farm.{nl}If we could provide a proof that it was due to the honey, the disciples would not only think about the altar.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001036	There are many altars around here.{nl}You know it already right? They are all created to praise Austeya Goddess.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001037	The disciples are only concentrating on the altars so they don't care whether we die in hunger or not.{nl}They think everything will be solved if they pray hard.{nl}That's why we decided to take an action.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001038	The bee box with that size, monsters will be lured to it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001039	How about it? Can you sense something?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001040	No response?{nl}Damn.. so he wasn't just going after the honey?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001041	The monsters were gathered near Bichiu Altar so I thought the honey was being collected there.{nl}If it wasn't for the honey, maybe there is a cause for it there.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001042	You will see Bichiu Altar when you go down the road from here. {nl}If you see something suspicious, please bring it to me.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001046	Ramar
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001047	Maras told you to show me this?{nl}This is the object that the disciples emphasized not to touch, was it broken like this originally?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001048	I should listen something from Maras.{nl}Something doen't feel right.. what's its use?
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001049	Ris
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001050	The monsters ruined all the fields so I should somehow try to start it all over again.{nl}Ah well, I confronted a honeypin so I just ran away without carrying anything.{nl}My agricultural equipment.. I don't know what to do from now.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001051	Thank you so much.{nl}The place where I lost it is Shirushie Sunny Fields.{nl}Honeypins are huge and scary so don't try too hard if you can't handle them.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001053	Valda
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001054	Maras told us to gather all empty bee box pieces, but I think it doesn't make sense at all.{nl}If we were to do that, we should defeat the monsters!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001055	I beg you.{nl}Please think of it like saving a person and collect the bee box pieces for me.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001056	Really? I am so touched.{nl}Ah, the location is Saltus bee farm.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001057	I can't do it this time even if we lose all the honey that we will consume next year.{nl}We may be better off just worrying about the lost farming equipment like Ris.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001058	Wow. So fragrant! {nl}Thank you so much. {nl}Ah, please keep it secret to Maras.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001059	We can't stop farming even if monsters are making mess.{nl}The monsters are still scary. Can you help me? It's not that hard.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001065	That's why we lured the demons into demonic stones..{nl}Hasty behavior from the villagers created the trouble.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001066	You can never say that you are not responsible for this.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001067	I don't know if it is due to the Day of Divine Tree, but the vicious energy started to gather from the deep inside the ground.{nl}The energy started to accumulate a lot and was about to explode.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001068	Austeya Goddess is trying her best to seal that energy.{nl}If she doesn't do that, this forest would turn into Vine Forest.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001075	The goddesses already blessed the villagers, but they don't know about it well.{nl}The goddesses don't want chaos.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001082	But of course, the power of Goddess resides indirectly in it. {nl}So you will have to consume some of demon's HP before using it.
QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001083	Good work. {nl}It's a uncomfortable to use demons as sacrifice.. Now we're in the final step.

QUEST_LV_0200_20150317_001119	Restore the weakened Seal Tower using symbol of Goddess Austeja.{nl}It's the Rankis seal and Ranka seal.
